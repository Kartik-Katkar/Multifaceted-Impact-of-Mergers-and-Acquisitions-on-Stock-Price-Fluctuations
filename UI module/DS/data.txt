Recent Acquisitions:
While UBS hasn't made any headline-grabbing acquisitions lately, here's a breakdown based on recent news and industry sources:
Credit Suisse Acquisition (Mar 2023): This was the most significant recent deal. Negotiations for acquiring Credit Suisse, a major Swiss competitor, garnered significant attention. However, due to regulatory concerns and potential financial burden, the deal ultimately fell through [Search for news articles on "UBS Credit Suisse Acquisition"].
Focus on Advisory Services:
UBS seems to be concentrating more on M&A advisory services for clients, leveraging their expertise in various sectors. Here's a closer look:
Sectoral Focus: Based on UBS's website [UBS Switzerland Corporate Finance], they actively advise on deals in sectors like:
Asset Management Telecom Operators
Healthcare (e.g., advising SFL on their sale to Veristat in 2022)
IT (e.g., advising on the sale of PMI to CMI)
Data Limitations and Further Research:
Limited Public Information: Unfortunately, UBS doesn't readily provide a comprehensive list of historical M&A deals on their website.
Here's how you can delve deeper for more recent and in-depth data:
Financial News Websites:
Search for news articles mentioning UBS's involvement in M&A activity within the past year. Focus on reputable publications like Bloomberg, Reuters, or The Financial Times.
Look for keywords like "UBS M&A," "UBS investment banking," or specific deal sectors (e.g., "UBS healthcare M&A").
Merger and Acquisition Databases:
Consider subscription-based platforms like S&P Capital IQ or Mergermarket. These offer comprehensive historical data on M&A deals, including those involving UBS as an advisor or acquirer.
Company Filings and Regulatory Disclosures:
For publicly traded companies acquired by UBS, you might find details in their SEC filings or regulatory disclosures.
Additional Insights: Look for industry reports or analyst insights on UBS's M&A strategy and focus areas.
Consider regional variations in UBS's M&A activity. Their website mentions expertise in Swiss M&A, so exploring Swiss financial news sources might be beneficial.By combining these resources, you can build a more comprehensive picture of UBS's recent M&A activity. Remember, the information might not be readily available in one place, but with some effort, you can uncover valuable insights.

As of my last update in January 2022, there haven't been any recent significant mergers involving UBS that I can provide specific details on. If you're looking for the latest information, I recommend checking financial news websites, UBS's official announcements, or reputable business news sources for the most up-to-date information on any mergers or acquisitions involving UBS.

Apart from private banking, UBS provides wealth management, asset management and investment banking services for private, corporate and institutional clients with international service. UBS manages the largest amount of private wealth in the world, counting approximately half of The World's Billionaires among its clients. UBS also maintains a global investment bank and is considered a primary market maker. The bank also maintains numerous underground bank vaults, bunkers and storage facilities for gold bars around the Swiss Alps and internationally. Partly due to its banking secrecy, it has been at the centre of numerous tax avoidance investigations undertaken by U.S., French, German, Israeli and Belgian authorities. UBS operations in Switzerland and the United States were respectively ranked first and second on the 2018 Financial Secrecy Index.

As of December 2023, UBS is the seventh largest bank in Europe with total assets worth over €1.554 trillion.[16] It is one of the eight global "Bulge Bracket" banks. It has over CHF 3.2 trillion in assets under management (AUM), approximately CHF 2.8 trillion of which are invested assets.[17] In June 2017, its return on invested capital was 11.1%, followed by Goldman Sachs' 9.35%, and JPMorgan Chase's 9.456%.[18] UBS acquired rival Credit Suisse in an emergency rescue deal brokered by the Swiss government and its Central bank in 2023, following which UBS' AUM increased to over $5 trillion along with an increased balanced sheet of $1.6 trillion.[19] In late 2016, UBS established a blockchain technology research lab in London to advance its cyber security and encryption of client activities. Based on regional deal flow and political influence, UBS is considered one of the "biggest, most powerful financial institutions in the world".[20][21] The company's capital strength, security protocols, and reputation for discretion have yielded a substantial market share in banking and a high level of brand loyalty. Alternatively, it receives routine criticism for facilitating tax noncompliance and off-shore financing. UBS is a primary dealer and Forex counterparty of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

UBS's corporate structure includes four divisions in total as of June 2018:[35][36]

Global Wealth Management
Personal & Corporate Bank
Asset Management
Investment Bank
Starting on 9 June 2003, all UBS business groups, including UBS Paine Webber and UBS Warburg, were rebranded under the UBS moniker following company's start of operations as a unified global entity.[37]

Global Wealth Management
UBS's global wealth management advisory division offers high-net-worth individuals around the world a range of advisory and investment products and services.[38] As of the end of 2016, UBS Wealth Management's invested assets totalled CHF 977billion.[39] The whole companies assets under management (AUM) amounted to US$1,737.5 billion in 2015, representing a 1% decrease in AUM compared to the equivalent data of 2014.[40] As of 2018, UBS manages the largest amount of private wealth in the world, counting approximately half of The World's Billionaires among its clients.[nb 4] More than 60% of total invested assets in UBS Wealth Management belong to individuals with a net worth of CHF 10 million or more. Of the remaining 40% of total invested assets, 30% of the total belong to individuals with net worth between CHF 1 million and CHF 10 million and the last 10% of total assets belong to individuals with a net worth of less than CHF 1 million.[38]

UBS offers brokerage services and products as well as asset management and other investment advisory and portfolio management products and services.[43][44] Additionally, UBS provides a broad range of securities and savings products that are supported by the firm's underwriting and research activities as well as clients' orders management and execution and also clearing services for transactions originated by individual investors. The business is further divided geographically with separate businesses focused on the U.S. and other international markets.[31][45] Two-thirds of the total invested assets come from Europe and Switzerland, with the final third coming mainly from the Asia-Pacific region.


UBS U.S. wealth management headquarters at Lincoln Harbor in Weehawken, New Jersey
With its headquarters in Switzerland, UBS Wealth Management is present in more than 40 countries with approximately 190 offices (100 of which are in Switzerland).[38] As of the end of 2018, around 23,600 people worldwide were employed by Global Wealth Management.[30][39] In Switzerland, UBS Swiss Bank provides a complete set of retail banking services that includes chequing, savings, credit cards, and mortgage products for individuals.[46] They offer cash management and commercial banking services for small businesses and corporate clients as well.[46]

UBS global wealth management advisory operations in the Americas consists of U.S. and Canadian wealth management businesses, as well as international business booked in the U.S.[47] UBS Wealth Management in the U.S. is an outgrowth of the former Paine Webber brokerage business. The business was initially renamed UBS Paine Webber in March 2001, after it was acquired by UBS. The division offers wealth management advice for ultra-high net worth and high net worth clients.[48] UBS was named "Best Bank for Wealth Management in North America" at the Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2017.[49]

UBS's main competitors in this division are Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Charles Schwab.[50]

Personal and Corporate Banking
UBS's Personal & Corporate Banking division delivers financial products and services to retail,[51] corporate and institutional clients[52] in Switzerland.[38] It also provides stable and substantial profits for the Group and revenue opportunities for businesses within the bank.[38] UBS maintains a leading position in the retail and corporate loan market in Switzerland; in fact, it serves one in three pension funds, more than 85% of the 1,000 largest Swiss corporations and 85% of banks that resides within the nation.[38] In 2015, 2017 and 2018, the international financial magazine Euromoney named UBS "Best Domestic Cash Manager Switzerland".[53] As of 31 December 2018, its lending portfolio reached US$131 billion (~$157 billion in 2023).[54][30]

The products that this UBS division offers range from cash accounts, payments, savings and retirement plans to investment fund products, residential mortgages and advisory services.[38] This business division constitutes a central building block of UBS's universal bank delivery model in Switzerland and it supports other divisions, such as Investment Bank, by referring clients to them and by assisting them to build their wealth to a level at which they can be transferred to UBS Wealth Management.[38] The retail and corporate distribution network comprises not only 279 branches in Switzerland, but 1,250 teller machines and self-service terminals, as well as digital banking services, serving 2.5 million personal banking clients.[38][30]

UBS Asset Management

UBS Asset Management offers equity, fixed income, currency, hedge fund, global real estate, infrastructure and private equity investment capabilities that can also be combined in multi-asset strategies.[55] The 1998 UBS-SBC merger and subsequent restructuring resulted in the combination of three major asset management operations: UBS Asset Management, Phillips & Drew (owned by Union Bank of Switzerland), and Brinson Partners (owned by SBC). The investment teams were merged in 2000 and in 2002 the brands were consolidated to become UBS Global Asset Management.[56]

At the end of December 2018, UBS Asset Management was responsible for US$781 billion of invested assets and the assets under administration were US$413 billion. [54][30] With around 2,300 employees in 23 countries, UBS Asset Management is the largest mutual fund manager in Switzerland, a leading fund house in Europe, and one of the largest hedge funds and real estate investment managers in the world.[57][58] It has main offices in Chicago, Hong Kong,[59] London,[60] New York, Singapore,[61] Sydney,[62] Tokyo, and Zürich.[63][30] With the aim to generate systematic products and services for clients, in 2017, UBS integrated Equities, Fixed Income and Solutions capabilities and hedge funds business within a new area named Investments. UBS also formed a new area of business named Real Estate and Private Markets by combining their Global Real Estate and Infrastructure and Private Equity businesses.[38]

In February 2017, UBS Group AG and the Northern Trust Corporation, an American international financial services company, announced an agreement for the acquisition of UBS Asset Management's fund administration servicing units in Luxembourg and Switzerland. This acquisition will facilitate the expansion of the Northern Trust Corporation into these two countries, turning the American company into the major fund administrator in the local markets and into one of the ten global leaders in the sector. At the end of the transaction, completed in October 2017,[64] the American company will administrate a total of CHF 420 billion in assets. UBS Asset Management will continue anyway to offer Management Company, White Labelling and Representative Services to its clients. Ulrich Körner, president of the UBS Asset Management, affirms that the continuous transformation of their platform is due to a major efficiency, effectiveness and geographical dislocation of the services offered by the bank.[65]

UBS's main competitors in this division are BlackRock, Vanguard Group, State Street Global Advisers (SSGA), Fidelity Investments and Allianz Asset Management (AAM).[66]

UBS Investment Bank

UBS Investment Bank's former offices in Stamford, Connecticut. At roughly the size of two American football fields, it was the largest column-less trading floor in the world.[67]
UBS Investment Bank provides services covering securities, other financial products, and research in equities, rates, credit, foreign exchange, precious metals and derivatives.[68] As of the end of December 2018, the personnel employed at UBS Investment Bank totalled 5,205, present in 33 countries (with principal offices in Chicago, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, New York, Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo and Zurich).[54][30] This business division also advises and provides access to capital markets for corporate and institutional clients, governments, financial intermediaries, alternative asset managers, and private investors.[46] UBS Investment Bank was formerly known as UBS Warburg and as Warburg Dillon Read, before the merger of the Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC). Within the UBS Investment Bank division, the Investment Banking Department (IBD) provides a range of advisory and underwriting services including mergers and acquisitions, restructuring, equity offerings, investment grade and high yield debt offerings, leveraged finance and leveraged loan structuring, and the private placement of equity, debt, and derivatives.

The Sales & Trading division comprises equities (brokering, dealing, market making and engaging in proprietary trading in equities, equity-related products, equity derivatives, and structured products) and FX, Rates and Credit (FRC) (brokering, dealing, market making and engaging in proprietary trading in interest rate products, credit products, mortgage-backed securities, leveraged loans, investment grade and high-yield debt, currencies, structured products, and derivative products). Following an expansion in 2002, the trading floor covers 9,600-square-metre (103,000 sq ft) with 12-metre (40 ft) arched ceilings. Over US$1 trillion in assets are traded here every trading day. In June 2011, it was announced that UBS was considering moving its North American headquarters back to New York City, and that the bank was looking for office spaces in Midtown and in the rebuilt World Trade Center.[69][70]

UBS's main competitors in this division are fellow members of the Bulge Bracket,[71] particularly Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America.[72][73] The American division also offers its own credit card not sponsored by another bank unlike many of its competitors.[74]

Competition

UBS and Credit Suisse branches next to each other in Zurich
On a global scale, UBS competes with the largest global investment banks,[75][76] particularly within the Bulge Bracket.[75][73] and until acquiring Credit Suisse in 2023 was regularly compared against it.[77][78] According to a 2018 study published by Coalition Research Institute, UBS was among the top 10 of the world's investment banks.[79]

In Switzerland: UBS competes with a number of cantonal banks, such as Zürcher Kantonalbank, Banque cantonale vaudoise and other cantonal banks, as well as Raiffeisen, PostFinance, and the Migros Bank.[citation needed]
In Europe: UBS competes with several larger banks, such as Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Crédit agricole, BNP Paribas, Natixis, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and UniCredit.[citation needed]
In the United States: UBS competes with the largest American banks, such as Citigroup, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.[citation needed]

In August 2010, UBS launched a new advertising campaign featuring the slogan: "We will not rest" and signed a global sponsorship agreement with Formula 1.[173][174] On 26 October 2010, UBS announced that its private bank recorded net new funds of CHF 900 million during the third quarter, compared to an outflow of CHF 5.5 billion in second quarter.[175] UBS's third quarter net profit of US$1.65 billion (~$2.25 billion in 2023) beat analyst estimates, continuing a string of profitability. After the elimination of almost 5,000 jobs, UBS announced on 23 August 2011 that it was further cutting another 3,500 positions to "improve operating efficiency" and save CHF 1.5 to CHF 2 billion a year. 45 percent of the job cuts would come from the investment banking unit, which continued to post dismal figures since the 2008 financial crisis, while the rest would come from the wealth management and asset management divisions. The firm has seen profits fall due to the rise of the Swiss franc.[176][177]

On 15 September 2011, UBS became aware of a massive loss, originally estimated at US$2 billion (~$2.67 billion in 2023), allegedly due to unauthorized trading by Kweku Adoboli, a then 31-year-old Ghanaian trader on the Delta One desk of the firm's investment bank.[178] Adoboli was arrested and later charged with fraud by abuse of position and false accounting dating as far back as 2008. UBS's actual losses were subsequently confirmed as US$2.3 billion, and according to the prosecutor in Adoboli's trial he "was a gamble or two from destroying Switzerland's largest bank for his own benefit."[179][180] On 24 September 2011 UBS announced chief executive Oswald Grübel's resignation, and the appointment of Sergio Ermotti as his replacement on an interim basis.[181][182]

On 30 October 2012, UBS announced that it was cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide in an effort to slim down its investment banking operations, of which 2,500 would be in Switzerland, followed by the United States and Great Britain. This 15-percent staff cut would make overall staff count come down from 63,745 to 54,000. (For comparison, the peak employment level in 2007 before the 2008 financial crisis was 83,500).[183][184] UBS also announced that the investment bank would focus on its traditional strengths and exit much of its fixed income trading business that was not economically profitable. On 19 December 2012, UBS was fined $1.5 billion (~$1.97 billion in 2023) for its role in the Libor scandal[185] over accusations that it tried to rig benchmark interest rates.[186] In November 2014, regulators including the FCA and CFTC hit UBS with fines, along with other banks, for currency manipulation.[187] On 6 January 2014, it was reported that UBS had become the largest private banker in the world, with $1.7 (~$2.16 trillion in 2023) trillion in assets.[188] In May 2015, media reports revealed UBS is planning to sell its Australian private banking division to some of its management after a review of underperforming businesses was conducted at the company.[189]

In late 2016, the bank created the digital currency "Utility Settlement Coin" (USC) to accelerate inter-bank settlements and established a blockchain technology research laboratory in London.[190][191] From 2012 to 2018, the investment bank, led by Andrea Orcel, initiated a major restructuring, firing over 10,000 employees and focusing on European underwriting business instead of traditional dealmaking.[192][193] UBS announced in January 2018 that it does not trade or expose clients to cryptocurrencies as it believes they have little to no elasticity, and are speculatively valued.[194] It partnered with technology company IBM to launch a blockchain trade finance platform called "Batavia" in early 2018.[195]

In April 2021, UBS reported a $774 million (~$859 million in 2023) loss from the collapse of US investment fund Archegos Capital Management.[196]

In July 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic, UBS announced it would continue to allow for flextime and remote work by many employees, noting that they did not impede productivity.[197] The announcement distinguished the bank from its competitors, such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which pressured on employees to return to the office as COVID-19 lockdowns and measures eased.[198][199]

In January 2022, UBS agreed to acquire Wealthfront for $1.4 billion.[200] UBS expects to accelerate its growth in the US with the purchase, and will operate Wealthfront as a business within UBS Global Wealth Management.[200] The acquisition was mutually terminated in September 2022 with both companies not providing a reason.[201][202] UBS announced that it would instead invest in a $69.7 million note convertible into Wealthfront shares, valuing the latter at its acquisition price.[202]

In November 2022, Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, made remarks by prerecorded video to the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit.[203] In it, he warned investors to not read too much foreign news (international media) about China, and said that some international investors read "too much" of it.[203] Later at the Summit, Colm Kelleher said, regarding global bankers, that "we're all very pro-China," and in reference to Fang's comments, said "We're not reading the American press, we actually buy the [China] story."[204][205]

Acquisition of Credit Suisse: 2023
Main article: Acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS
In March 2023, UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse, one of its main competitors, for $3.25 billion (CHF 3 billion), in an emergency rescue deal.[206][207][208] On 29 March 2023 it was announced that Sergio Ermotti is returning as chief executive officer from 5 April 2023, replacing Ralph Hamers after just over two years in charge, after approval by 5 April 2023 annual general meeting.[209] Hamers is expected to stay with the bank for a transition period.[210] UBS completed the acquisition on 12 June 2023.[211][212]

On 28 June, it became known that UBS plans to lay off more than half of Credit Suisse's employees. First of all, the reduction will affect traders and support staff in London, New York and some Asian divisions. Prior to the takeover, Credit Suisse employed about 45,000 people.[213]

In July 2023, UBS was fined $269 million by the Federal Reserve and $119 million by the Bank of England for Credit Suisse's failure in risk management related to Archegos's collapse.[214] In August 2023, UBS settled with the US Justice Department by agreeing to pay $1.43 billion in civil penalties regarding allegations of fraud and misconduct in its residential mortgage-backed securities offerings it offered in 2006 and 2007.[215]

According to Citigroup, the new bank will account for 35% of domestic deposits, 31% of corporate loans and 26% of mortgages in Switzerland.[216] UBS will keep the Swiss business of Credit Suisse but will retire its brand. UBS says it plans to cut costs by $10 billion. UBS also announced at the end of August 2023 that money outflows have stopped at Credit Suisse.[216]

In early September 2023, UBS had clearly profited from the takeover as its stocks were increasingly valuable. From April to July, UBS made a record profit of 29.2 billion CHF and its stocks, which were initially depressed after the fusion, were traded at much higher prices. The record profit was based on the difference between the purchase price of Credit Suisse stocks and the apparently higher value of its assets.[217] [218]

In September 2023, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) started investigating UBS for Credit Suisse's alleged compliance failures which enabled its Russian clients to dodge sanctions.[219] Later UBS stated that the bank is not aware of such a probe by the DOJ and that previous reports on such allegations were incorrect.[220]

Acquisition history
As it exists today, UBS represents a conglomeration of dozens of individual firms, many of which date back to the 19th century. Over the years, these firms merged to form the bank's three major predecessors, Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corporation, ICO Markets Exchange Clearing Limited and Paine Webber. The following is a visual illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors, although this is not necessarily a comprehensive list:[221]

Banking secrecy
UBS frequently cites Swiss culture—specifically its penchant for privacy, security and neutrality—as foundational to its company culture.[227] Although banking secrecy started in the 1700s, Switzerland drafted a series of banking regulations and statutes in the late 1800s and 1930s to protect and secure banks within its borders.[228] The most prominent was the Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks, known simply as the "Banking Law of 1934".[229] The federal law prohibits and criminalizes the distribution and release of client information to third parties.[229] The bill was passed by the Swiss Federal Assembly to combat the seizure of client assets and information for reasons debated by historians.[228] UBS, then known as the Swiss Bank Corporation, received large influxes of capital from Europe for safe keeping during the war.[230] More than two dozen Swiss banking statutes were drafted from 1934 to 2008 to strengthen banking secrecy at UBS Switzerland AG.[230] In 2018, Switzerland, alongside major Swiss banks including UBS, was ranked first on the Financial Secrecy Index.[231] UBS was the largest wealth manager in 23 of the top 25 countries on the 2018 Financial Secrecy Index.[231]

While UBS maintains the strictest banking secrecy policies in Switzerland, its policies across Europe and especially the United States are comparable.[230][better source needed] Within the U.S., the bank is prohibited from disclosing client activities and information both internally and through regulation imposed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), U.S. Treasury, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and various U.S. state regulators.[232] UBS employees are prohibited from discussing client activity or information publicly, sharing information across borders, retaining client information insecurely and required to maintain robust bank-client confidentiality agreements.[232] In 2018, UBS operations within the U.S. were ranked second on the Financial Secrecy Index, following UBS Switzerland AG.[231] Within the European Union (E.U.), UBS operations maintain similar banking secrecy policies to Switzerland in the following countries and crown dependencies: Jersey, Austria, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Monaco, and the Isle of Man.[233] Substantial, albeit greatly reduced, banking secrecy provisions are afforded to UBS operations in France, Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands.[233]

Hidden assets
UBS, along with other Swiss banks, maintains a variety of hidden assets and numbered bank accounts in an effort to preserve anonymity and confidentiality.[234] Despite its name, hidden accounts are not truly hidden.[235] The usage of these types of accounts (and assets) limits the knowledge of the account between the client and a restricted number of private bankers who retain record of who the account belongs to.[235]

In January 1997, Christoph Meili, a night guard at the Union Bank of Switzerland (precursor of UBS) in Zürich, publicly announced that bank officials were destroying documents about orphaned assets, believed to be the credit balances of both Nazi German and Jewish clients attained during World War II.[227] Soon after, Zurich authorities opened a judicial investigation against Meili for suspected violations of the Swiss laws on banking secrecy.[236] After a US$2.56 billion lawsuit was filed against UBS and other Swiss banks on behalf of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, a settlement was reached that totalled US$1.25 billion in August 1998.[237][238]

The Swiss government has taken steps to curb the usage of hidden services by foreign account holders as they have been frequently used to facilitate the transfer of "black money".[239] In May 2013, Switzerland announced that it would amend certain banking secrecy laws applicable to UBS Switzerland AG to allow the disclosure of hidden client accounts to various investigative authorities.[239] However, the disclosure of such information is heavily regulated and only "occur exclusively within the scope of administrative assistance procedures based on a valid double taxation agreement."[234]

Bank vaults and bunkers
UBS, along with other Swiss banks, owns and operates undisclosed or otherwise secretive bank vaults, storage facilities or underground bunkers for gold bars, diamonds, cash, or other valuable physical assets.[227][240] The geographical location of these facilities are undisclosed to the public but are known to be present in the mountainous regions of the Swiss Alps.[241] These facilities are not subject to the same banking regulations as banks in Switzerland and do not have to report holdings to regulatory agencies.[241][242] According to the Swiss Armed Forces, UBS purchased four former military bunkers to convert into storage facilities throughout the 1980s and 1990s.[227][243] Three of these bunkers are not accessible by road or foot and require aircraft transportation.[227] The transfer of assets to these bunkers is selective as a multi-stage security clearance is required and is not available to all UBS clients.[241] In special circumstances, UBS contracts smaller banks in Southern Switzerland to maintain company assets.[227]

The largest disclosed Swiss bank vault is five floors (19 metres or 62 feet) under the bank's Geneva headquarters.[244] In July 2013, UBS established a gold storage facility and depository in Singapore for high net worth and ultra high net worth clients in their Hong Kong, China, and Malaysia markets who are willing to pay high fees and commissions for the highest level of secrecy and safety for their assets.[243]

Tax evasion
Main article: UBS tax evasion controversies
The strict banking secrecy policies and bank-client confidentiality agreements at UBS have frequently been used to avoid, evade or otherwise escape foreign direct taxation. UBS reached multilateral agreements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and U.K. HM Revenue and Customs in 2009 and 2010, respectively.[245] These agreements ensured a line of communication between the tax agencies and all registered Swiss banks.[246] The most commonly used stipulation triggered by select UBS Switzerland AG clients regard the following statute: Swiss banks are only allowed to disclose client information if a client is legally charged with proof of deliberate financial fraud, not merely the non-reporting of assets to avoid taxation.[234]

The banking privacy policies of UBS have led to numerous controversies and disagreements with foreign governments:


The French supreme court, Cour de Cassation, ruled against UBS in their 2014 appeal of tax evasion.
In 2007, Bradley Birkenfeld, a Geneva-based employee who worked in the bank's North American wealth management business, claimed that UBS's dealings with American clients violated an agreement between the bank and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.[247] He subsequently complained to UBS compliance officials about the bank's "unfair and deceptive business practices", which included sponsoring events like yacht races and art festivals in the United States to attract wealthy people as potential clients.[248] UBS was charged by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and ordered it to cease providing cross-border private banking services to US-domiciled clients through its non-US regulated units as of July 2008.[249]
In 2012, the German government saw to it that UBS Deutschland AG came under investigation by prosecutors in Mannheim, Germany, after a tax probe revealed suspicious funds transfers from Germany to Switzerland allegedly facilitated by the bank's Frankfurt office.[250] UBS Deutschland's Frankfurt office was raided by tax investigators in May 2012, and over 100,000 computer files and records were seized for evidence. The bank, which claims it is cooperating with the investigators, said that "an internal investigation into the specific allegations has not identified any evidence of misbehaviour by UBS Deutschland AG."[250]
In 2014, the French government launched an investigation into UBS France's alleged abetting of tax evasion by French taxpayers.[251] The investigation estimated the amount of tax income lost to UBS-controlled offshore accounts at €600 billion.[252] In July 2014, the bank was required to post a bond of 1.1 billion euros, which UBS complied with while making multiple appeals in the French court system, finally losing its appeal at the Cour de Cassation, France's highest court.[253] That same year, UBS accused the French government of engaging in a "highly politicized process" in its investigation of the bank.[254]
In December 2021, UBS was criminally convicted by an appeals court in France for "illegal banking activities", money laundering and "aggravated tax fraud" and fined €1.8 billion.[255][256] UBS has said it is appealing that decision.[257]

Corporate social responsibility
In January 2010, UBS issued a new code of conduct and business ethics which all employees were encouraged to sign. The code addressed issues such as financial crime, competition, confidentiality, as well as human rights and environmental issues. The eight-page code also lays out potential sanctions against employees who violate it, including warnings, demotions, or dismissal.[258] According to Kaspar Villiger, former chairman of the board, and Oswald J. Grübel, former Group CEO, the code is "an integral part of changing the way UBS conducts business".[259]

In 2011, UBS expanded its global compliance database to include information on environmental and social issues provided by RepRisk,[260] a global research firm specialized in environmental, social and corporate governance (e.g., ESG) risk analytics and metrics.[261] This was done in an effort to mitigate environmental and social risks that could impact the bank's reputation or financial performance and to simultaneously help globally standardize and systematically implement the firm's due diligence processes.[262] RepRisk data is used in the on-boarding process to screen potential new clients and sourcing partners,[263] alongside periodic client reviews and, also, to evaluate the risks related to transactions in investment banking and institutional lending.[264]

In 2018, UBS held 0.72% of shares in HikVision[265] (surveillance cameras), a subsidiary of the Chinese military conglomerate CETC.

In October 2019, UBS joined UN's Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance (GISD).[266] UBS has committed to raise US$5 billion (~$5.55 billion in 2023) of SDG-related impact investments by the end of 2021, which aim to create a measurable positive social or environmental impact.[266]

Research and development
Blockchain
UBS has been an early adopter regarding the use of blockchain technology in financial services. In April 2015, UBS opened an innovation lab at the Level39 technology accelerator space in London.[267]

In August 2016, UBS announced that it will team up with BNY Mellon, Deutsche Bank, Banco Santander, brokerage company ICAP and the fintech company Clearmatics, to promote UBS's "Utility Settlement Coin" (USC). The USC is a blockchain-based digital currency that financial institutions could use to transact securities with each other, bypassing the traditional settlement processes which is ongoing.[268]

IMECL
In 2021, UBS buys 31% ICO Markets Exchange Clearing Limited, Digital Asset Exchange, Regulator Company in the European Digital Asset Market which financial institutions and private clients they will use to trade securities among themselves, bypassing the traditional ongoing settlement processes.[269]

Artificial intelligence
In 2018, UBS digitally cloned Daniel Kalt, one of its chief economists. Artificial intelligence expert FaceMe was hired to create an interactive avatar of Kalt that can meet with clients via television screen. The clients will be able to ask questions and receive answers, made possible by IBM's Watson AI technology.[270][271]

Recognition
In 2006, for the fourth consecutive year, UBS was named one of the 100 Best Companies for Working Mothers living in the U.S. by Working Mother magazine.[272] It is a member of the Stonewall Diversity Champions scheme[273] and has active gay and lesbian, ethnic minority, and women's networking groups. UBS was included on Business Week's The Best Places to Launch a Career 2008, and ranked No. 96 out of the 119 total companies listed.[273] On 2 February 2010, UBS topped the charts for the ninth year in a row in Institutional Investor's annual ranking of Europe's most highly regarded equity analysts. In a year of extremes for equity markets, money managers say that no firm did a better job than UBS to keep them informed about which European sectors, countries, and industries offered the greatest potential.[274] On 4 May 2010, UBS Investment Bank was voted the leading pan-European brokerage firm for equity and equity linked research for a record tenth successive year. A Thomson Reuters Extel survey ranked UBS number one in all three of the key disciplines of research: Research (tenth year); Sales (ninth year running); and Equity Trading and Execution (up from second place in 2009). UBS was also named as the number one leading pan-European brokerage firm for economics and strategy research.[275]

On 31 October 2013, UBS Wealth Management was voted the Best Global Private Bank by Professional Wealth Management,[276] retaining the title in 2014 while also being recognized as the Best Private Bank for Philanthropy Services, and Best Global Brand in Private Banking.[277] On 27 October 2016, for the 4th consecutive year, UBS Wealth Management won the Best Global Private Bank title, as well as the Best Private Bank in Asia award for the 5th consecutive year.[278] UBS won the top prize again in 2018.[279]

In 2014, the Group received Euromoney's Awards for Excellence 2014 as the Best global bank,[280][281] and as the Best Bank in Switzerland.[282] In 2017, UBS not only retained its leading position taken in 2016 in the main category best private banking services overall at the Euromoney's Private Banking Awards,[283] but also received recognition as Western Europe's best bank for advisory 2017.[284]

In 2018, for the third consecutive year, RobecoSAM, an organization specialized exclusively on Sustainability Investing and conducting extensive research,[285] named UBS in its Industry group leader report 2018 for each of the industry groups represented in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index the group leader[286] in Diversified Financials.[287] The report highlighted Group's sustainability efforts directed through its UBS and Society program: a cross-divisional platform involving activities and capabilities in sustainable investing and philanthropy, environmental and human rights policies, UBS's own environmental footprint, as well as the community investment.[288] The Group also received recognition from Global Finance which rates financial services providers that best meet the specialized needs of corporations on a global level. The selection criteria are focused less on the size, but rather on qualities that companies look for when choosing a provider.[289][290] UBS was named in the category Global Winners as Best Private Bank in the World 2017,[291] and in the list of global best banks 2017, the Group received the award as Global Winner in the category World's Best Investment Banks 2017.[290][292]

In 2019, UBS was listed as one of the Top 50 World's Most Attractive Employers Global Business Ranking 2019 by Universum Global Survey.

will provide exciting opportunities for PaineWebber employees. This is the right merger, with the right
partner, at the right time.”
Markus Granziol, Chairman and CEO of UBS Warburg, added:

General Electric and Yasuda Mutual Life, PaineWebber’s two largest shareholders, who together account
for approximately 30% of the issued share capital, have entered into agreements with UBS to vote in favor
of the merger.
Rationale for the merger
The merger adds a leading position with US affluent and high net worth clients to what is already the
world’s largest private bank. The US is the biggest and fastest growing wealth management market in the
world. The combination creates a truly global private clients business, based on a single philosophy of
personal focus and advice. Both UBS and PaineWebber share a vision of using technology to enhance the
client relationship. The combined private clients businesses bring together leading edge approaches to
wealth management, from traditional services such as trusts and inheritance planning to brand new teams
focused on specific client segments such as entrepreneurs and executives.
UBS and PaineWebber expect that there will be minimal disruption to PaineWebber’s clients and its
financial advisor network resulting from the merger.
Following completion of the merger, approximately half of the private client assets of the combined
business will be drawn from high net worth and affluent clients in the US, 15% from Swiss clients and 35%
from clients elsewhere in the world.
Combining the two US investment banking and securities franchises is also a significant step. UBS
Warburg has a particularly strong position in distributing non-US products to US clients, and PaineWebber
brings significant equity and fixed income distribution strength and a top ten ranked US equity research
team. Strong US retail distribution will also enhance the ability to win primary mandates globally. UBS
Warburg provides a wealth of content with a wide range of attractive products and expertise that can be
leveraged for PaineWebber's private clients, from top-rank global equity research to direct access to new
issues across the world's securities markets, and a superior private equity capability. PaineWebber also
adds strengths in specialist investment banking areas such as municipal finance, commercial real estate and
asset backed securities.
UBS’s financial strength allied to PaineWebber’s experience, content, quality of management and proven
track record create exciting growth potential for the combined business.
The new organization
Following completion of the merger, PaineWebber will be an integral part of UBS Warburg. The
PaineWebber brand will be used as the private client brand for UBS in the US. Its Private Client group will
absorb the existing UBS Warburg Private Clients business unit and e-services initiative and will be
responsible for all of UBS's onshore private client services outside Switzerland. Mitchell Hutchins and DSI,
PaineWebber’s asset management businesses along with their Transaction Services group, will continue to
be linked to the Private Client group in order to retain their close connections.
PaineWebber's Capital Markets group will be integrated with the UBS Warburg Corporate and Institutional
Clients business unit.
Management and employees
UBS places the highest value on the skills and experience of PaineWebber’s management and employees
and their importance to the business. An $875 million incentive plan comprising stock and cash will be set
aside for key PaineWebber professionals, including their financial advisors, to be paid out over the next
three years.
On completion of the merger, Joseph J. Grano, currently President of PaineWebber, will manage the
combined private client and asset management businesses of UBS Warburg. Donald B. Marron will
continue as Chairman of PaineWebber Incorporated. He will also assume a new role as Chairman of UBS
North America and will be available to advise UBS CEO, Marcel Ospel, on strategy.
Financial impact of the transaction
The price of $73.50 per PaineWebber share values PaineWebber’s outstanding share capital at $10.8
billion. The offer price represents a premium of 47% over PaineWebber’s closing price on 11July 2000 and
a multiple of 18.1 times I/B/E/S estimated 2000 earnings. The transaction is expected to be cash EPS
enhancing from 2001, and meets all UBS’s investment criteria. The return on investment in 2002 is
expected to be greater than UBS’s weighted average cost of financing of 6.4% and the return on invested
equity is expected to exceed significantly UBS’s cost of group equity.
Synergies are estimated at $425 million per annum pre-tax and are expected to be fully achieved by 2002.
Approximately 55% of the synergies are expected to be derived from revenue enhancement and 45% from
cost savings. Revenue synergies will be driven by enlarged distribution for fixed income and equity
products and increased corporate finance opportunities. Cost savings will be obtainable in vendor
management, procurement and from some overlap in operations. Benefits will also be achieved in financing
costs. Restructuring costs are expected to be $400 million, mainly relating to US integration.
The transaction will be accounted for under purchase accounting rules with a 20 year goodwill amortization
period.
UBS will seek shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting for the payment of a dividend in
respect of the nine months ending 30 September 2000 to UBS shareholders of record on 2 October 2000
who will receive the dividend shortly thereafter. A second dividend will be paid in respect of the fourth
quarter of 2000 to all UBS shareholders of record, including holders of newly issued UBS shares.
At the end of 2000, UBS's pro forma BIS Tier 1 capital ratio is expected to be between 8.5% and 9.0%.
UBS’s strong internal capital generation allows it to strengthen its capital ratios rapidly. UBS will continue
to actively manage its capital, and will repurchase shares when market conditions are favorable and internal
cashflow support this action.

Overall Deal Volume
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity in 2023 has shown signs of resurgence following a sluggish start earlier in the year, as indicated by insights from the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) M&A Report. The overall deal volume, which refers to the total number of M&A transactions completed during a specific period, has been observed to increase. However, the exact figures can vary depending on the data source and the specific market conditions in different regions and industries.

Factors Influencing Deal Volume:
Market Sentiment: Improving economic conditions and investor confidence have contributed to a renewed interest in M&A activities.
Sector Dynamics: Certain sectors may experience higher deal volumes due to industry-specific factors such as technological advancements, regulatory changes, or shifts in consumer behavior.
Geographical Variations: Deal volumes can vary significantly across different regions, influenced by geopolitical factors, regulatory environments, and market maturity.
Deal Value
While deal volume is on the rise, it's important to distinguish between deal volume and deal value. Deal value refers to the total monetary worth of all M&A transactions completed within a specified period. Unlike deal volume, which measures the quantity of transactions, deal value provides insights into the financial magnitude and strategic significance of M&A activities.

Key Considerations for Deal Value:
Transaction Size: Large-scale transactions can significantly impact deal value, even if the number of deals remains stable or fluctuates.
Valuation Metrics: Fluctuations in asset valuations, market multiples, and financing terms can influence the total value of M&A transactions.
Currency Exchange Rates: Global M&A transactions are often denominated in multiple currencies, affecting the reported deal values in different regions.
Key Drivers of M&A Activity in 2023
Several key drivers are shaping the landscape of M&A decisions in 2023, reflecting broader economic trends and strategic imperatives across industries:

Sustainability
The emphasis on sustainability has become increasingly integral to corporate strategies, influencing M&A decisions. Companies are integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria into their operations and seeking acquisitions that align with sustainable business practices and regulatory requirements.

Digitalization
The rapid pace of digital transformation continues to drive M&A activity, particularly in technology-intensive sectors such as software, cybersecurity, and digital infrastructure. Companies are pursuing acquisitions to enhance technological capabilities, improve operational efficiencies, and capitalize on emerging digital trends.

Scarcity of Capital
The scarcity of capital, characterized by fluctuating interest rates, financing constraints, and competitive borrowing costs, has compelled companies to explore M&A as a strategic avenue for growth and market expansion. Access to capital remains a critical factor influencing deal-making decisions in 2023.

Resources for Detailed Analysis
For a more nuanced analysis of M&A trends and insights, organizations like the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) publish comprehensive reports that delve into:

Regional Dynamics: Variations in M&A activity across different geographic markets and regulatory environments.
Industry Trends: Sector-specific developments, including consolidation trends, disruptive technologies, and regulatory challenges.
Deal Types: Analysis of transaction types such as mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, and strategic partnerships.
Utilizing BCG M&A Report and Similar Resources
The BCG M&A Report and similar industry reports offer valuable data-driven insights, enabling stakeholders to assess market opportunities, mitigate risks, and formulate informed strategies for navigating the evolving landscape of mergers and acquisitions.

In conclusion, while M&A activity in 2023 shows promising signs of recovery in terms of deal volume, the total value of transactions requires further analysis to provide a comprehensive view of market dynamics. Sustainability, digitalization, and capital availability are pivotal drivers influencing M&A decisions, underscoring the strategic importance of understanding these factors for stakeholders across industries.

For stakeholders seeking deeper insights into M&A trends and strategic implications, leveraging specialized reports and industry analyses remains instrumental in gaining a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics and emerging opportunities.
