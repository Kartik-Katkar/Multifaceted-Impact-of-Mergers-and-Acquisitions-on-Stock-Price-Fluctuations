Item 4.B.2. Geographic breakdown of total revenues of UBS Group AG consolidated
The allocation of total revenues by geographical region for the Credit Suisse subgroup is not available on the same allocation 
basis as for UBS Group for 2023 and the cost to develop this information would be excessive. The below information is 
disclosed for UBS AG subgroup and for Credit Suisse AG subgroup, in their own accounting standards.
UBS AG consolidated
UBS AG’s Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board and are stated in USD. The operating regions shown in the table below correspond to the regional 
management structure of UBS AG. The allocation of revenues to these regions reflects, and is consistent with, the basis on which 
the business is managed and its performance is evaluated. These allocations involve assumptions and judgments that management 
considers to be reasonable, and may be refined to reflect changes in estimates or management structure. 
The main principles of the allocation methodology are that client revenues are attributed to the domicile of the client, and trading 
and portfolio management revenues are attributed to the country where the risk is managed. This revenue attribution is consistent 
with the mandate of the regional Presidents. Certain revenues, such as those related to Non-core and Legacy and Group Items, 
are managed at a Group level. These revenues are included in the Global column.

Credit Suisse AG consolidated
Credit Suisse AG’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted 
in the US (US GAAP) and are stated in Swiss francs (CHF). Responsibility for each product is allocated to a specific segment, 
which records all related revenues and expenses. Revenue-sharing and service level agreements govern the compensation 
received by one segment for generating revenue or providing services on behalf of another. Corporate services and business 
support in finance, operations, human resources, legal, compliance, risk management and IT are provided by corporate 
functions, and the related costs are allocated to the segments and Corporate Center based on their requirements and other 
relevant measures.
The designation of net revenues and income/(loss) before taxes is based on the location of the office recording the transactions. 
This presentation does not reflect the way the Credit Suisse AG is managed.

Disclosure Pursuant To Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction And Syrian Human Rights Act
Section 219 of the US Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (“ITRA”) added Section 13(r) to the US 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) requiring each SEC reporting issuer to disclose in its 
annual and, if applicable, quarterly reports whether it or any of its affiliates have knowingly engaged in certain activities, 
transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with the Government of Iran or certain designated natural persons or entities 
involved in terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction during the period covered by the report. The required 
disclosure may include reporting of activities not prohibited by US or other law, even if conducted outside the US by non-US 
affiliates in compliance with local law. Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, we note the following for the period 
covered by this annual report:
UBS has a Group Sanctions Policy that prohibits transactions involving sanctioned countries, including Iran, and sanctioned 
individuals and entities. However, UBS Switzerland AG maintains one account involving the Iranian government under the 
auspices of the United Nations in Geneva after agreeing with the Swiss government that it would do so only under certain 
conditions. These conditions include that payments involving the account must: (1) be made within Switzerland; (2) be 
consistent with paying rent, salaries, telephone and other expenses necessary for its operations in Geneva; and (3) not involve 
any Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) blocked or otherwise restricted under US or Swiss law. In 2023, the gross 
revenues for this UN-related account were approximately USD 5,731.46. We do not allocate expenses to specific client 
accounts in a way that enables us to calculate net profits with respect to any individual account. UBS AG intends to continue 
maintaining this account pursuant to the conditions it has established with the Swiss Government and consistent with its Group 
Sanctions Policy.
As previously reported, UBS had certain outstanding legacy trade finance arrangements issued on behalf of Swiss client 
exporters in favor of their Iranian counterparties. In February 2012 UBS ceased accepting payments on these outstanding 
export trade finance arrangements and worked with the Swiss government who insured these contracts (Swiss Export Risk 
Insurance "SERV"). On December 21, 2012, UBS and the SERV entered into certain Transfer and Assignment Agreements 
under which SERV purchased all of UBS's remaining receivables under or in connection with Iran-related export finance 
transactions. Hence, the SERV is the sole beneficiary of said receivables. There was no financial activity involving Iran in 
connection with these trade finance arrangements in 2023, and no gross revenue or net profit.
In connection with these trade finance arrangements, UBS Switzerland AG has maintained one existing account relationship 
with an Iranian bank. This account was established prior to the US designation of this bank and maintained due to the existing 
trade finance arrangements. In 2007, following the designation of the bank pursuant to sanctions issued by the US, UN and 
Switzerland, the account was blocked under Swiss law and remained subject to blocking requirements until January 2016. 
Client assets as of 31 December 2023 were CHF 3,097.40. Gross revenues were USD 3.69 equivalent.
In addition to the above, during 2023, Credit Suisse AG processed a small number of de minimis payments related to the 
operation of Iranian diplomatic missions in Switzerland and related to fees for ministerial government functions such as issuing 
passports and visas. Processing these payments is permitted under Swiss law, and Credit Suisse AG intends to continue 
processing such payments. Revenues and profits from these activities are not calculated but would be negligible.

Item 10. Additional Information.
B—Memorandum and Articles of Association.
Please see the Articles of Association of UBS Group AG (Exhibit 1.1 to this Form 20-F) and the Organization Regulations of 
UBS Group AG (Exhibit 1.2 to this Form 20-F). 
Set forth below is a summary of the material provisions of the Articles of Association of UBS Group AG (the “Articles”), 
Organization Regulations of UBS Group AG (the “Organization Regulations”) and relevant Swiss laws, in particular the Swiss 
Code of Obligations, relating to the ordinary shares of UBS Group AG (the “shares”). This description does not purport to be 
complete and is qualified in its entirety by references to Swiss law, including Swiss company law, and to the Articles and 
Organization Regulations. 
The principal legislation under which UBS Group AG operates, and under which the shares are issued, is the Swiss Code of 
Obligations.
Shares and Shareholders
Shares
The shares are registered shares (Namenaktien) with a par value of USD 0.10 per share and are issued as uncertificated 
securities (einfache Wertrechte) (in the sense of the Swiss Code of Obligations). The shares are fully paid up, and there is no 
liability of shareholders to further capital calls by UBS Group AG. The shares rank pari passu in all respects with each other, 
including voting rights, entitlement to dividends, share of the liquidation proceeds in case of the liquidation of UBS Group AG, 
preemptive rights in the event of a share issue (Bezugsrechte) and advance subscription rights in the event of the issuance of 
equity-linked securities (Vorwegzeichnungsrechte).
The Articles provide that we may elect to print and deliver certificates for shares at any time. However, shareholders have no 
right to request the printing and delivery of certificates for shares or the conversion of the shares into another form. 
Share Register
Swiss law distinguishes between registration with and without voting rights. Shareholders must be registered in our share 
register as shareholders with voting rights in order to vote and participate in shareholders’ meetings or to assert or exercise 
other rights related to voting rights. 
Swiss law and the Articles require UBS Group AG to keep a share register in which the names, addresses and nationality (or 
registered office in the case of legal entities) of the owners of the shares are recorded. The main function of the share register is 
to register shareholders entitled to vote and participate in shareholders’ meetings, or to assert or exercise other rights related to 
voting rights.
A shareholder will be registered in our share register with voting rights upon disclosure of its name, address and nationality (or 
registered office in the case of legal entities). However, we may decline a registration with voting rights if the shareholder does 
not declare that it has acquired the shares in its own name and for its own account. If the shareholder refuses to make such 
declaration, it will be registered in our share register as a shareholder without voting rights.
In order to register shares in our share register, a shareholder must file a share registration form with the share register. Failing 
such registration, a shareholder may not vote at or participate in shareholders’ meetings, but will be entitled to receive 
dividends and other rights with financial value, such as preemptive rights in the event of a share issue (Bezugsrechte) and 
advance subscription rights in the event of the issuance of equity-linked securities (Vorwegzeichnungsrechte), and its share of 
liquidation proceeds. Shareholders registered in our share register may at any time request from us a confirmation of the shares 
that they hold according to our share register.
UBS Group AG’s share register is kept by UBS Shareholder Services, P.O. Box, 8098 Zurich, Switzerland. UBS Shareholder 
Services is responsible for the registration of the shares. The share register is split into two parts – a Swiss register, which is 
maintained by UBS Group AG, acting as Swiss share registrar, and a US register, which is maintained by Computershare Trust 
Company NA, c/o Computershare Investor Services, P.O. Box 505000, Louisville, KY 40233-5000, United States, as US 
transfer agent. 
Transfer of Shares
The transfer of shares constituting intermediated securities (Bucheffekten) (within the meaning of the Swiss Federal 
Intermediated Securities Act) is effected by entries in securities accounts in accordance with applicable law. The transfer of 
shares that do not constitute intermediated securities is effected by way of a written declaration of assignment and requires 
notice to UBS Group AG.
Annual Report 2023 15
Shareholders’ Meetings 
A shareholders’ meeting is convened by the Board of Directors (the “BoD”) or, if necessary, by the company’s statutory 
auditors upon notification of the shareholders at least 20 days prior to such meeting. An invitation to any shareholders’ meeting 
will be sent to all registered shareholders. The Articles do not require a minimum number of shareholders to be present in order 
to hold a shareholders’ meeting.
Unless otherwise provided by Swiss law or the Articles (as indicated below), resolutions require the approval of a majority of 
the votes represented, excluding blank and invalid ballots, at a shareholders’ meeting in order to be passed.
Under Swiss corporate law (or Swiss banking law, as the case may be), a resolution passed at a shareholders’ meeting with the 
approval of at least a two-thirds of the votes, and a majority of the nominal value of shares, in each case represented at such 
meeting is required in order to approve:
• A change in the corporation’s stated purpose in its articles of association;
• The consolidation of shares, unless the consent of all the shareholders concerned is required;
• The restriction or exclusion of preemptive rights in the event of a share issue (Bezugsrechte);
• The conversion of participation certificates into shares;
• The introduction of shares with preferential voting rights;
• Any restriction on the transferability of registered shares;
• Any change in the currency of the share capital;
• The introduction of a casting vote for the person chairing the shareholders’ meeting;
• A provision of the articles of association on holding the shareholders’ meeting abroad;
• The delisting of the equity securities of the corporation;
• The creation of conditional capital, the introduction of a capital band or, in accordance with Swiss banking law, the 
introduction of reserve capital;
• An increase in share capital in consideration of contributions in kind, or by off-set of a claim, or involving the 
granting of special privileges, or from the transformation of reserves into share capital;
• A change of domicile of the corporation; 
• The introduction of an arbitration clause in the articles of association; 
• Dissolution of the corporation.
Under the Articles, a resolution passed at a shareholders’ meeting with the approval of at least two-thirds of the votes 
represented at such meeting is required in order to approve:
• A change to the provisions in the Articles regarding the number of members of the BoD;
• Removal of one-quarter or more of the members of the BoD; or
• The deletion or modification of the provision of the Articles establishing these supermajority requirements.
At shareholders’ meetings, a shareholder can be represented by a legal representative or under a written power of attorney by a 
proxy who does not need to be a shareholder or, under a written or electronic power of attorney, by the independent proxy. 
Votes are taken electronically, by written ballot or by a show of hands. Shareholders representing at least 3% of the votes 
represented may always request that a vote or election take place electronically or by a written ballot. 
Net Profits and Dividends
Swiss law requires that at least 5% of the annual net profits of a corporation must be retained and booked as statutory retained 
earnings until these retained earnings equal, together with the corporation’s statutory capital reserve, no less than 50% of the 
corporation’s share capital registered in the commercial register. Holding companies, such as UBS Group AG, must increase 
their statutory retained earnings until these equal, together with their statutory capital reserve, no less than 20% of the holding 
company’s share capital registered in the commercial register. Any remaining net profit of the corporation may be allocated by 
the shareholders represented at the applicable shareholders’ meeting.
Under Swiss law, dividends may be paid by a corporation only if, based on its audited standalone statements prepared in 
accordance with Swiss law, the corporation has sufficient distributable profits from the previous financial years or if the 
reserves of the corporation are sufficient to allow distribution of a dividend. In either event, dividends may be paid by the 
corporation only after approval by the shareholders’ meeting. The BoD may propose to the shareholders that a dividend be 
paid, but cannot itself set the dividend. The corporation’s statutory auditors must confirm that any dividend proposal of the 
BoD is in accordance with Swiss law and the corporation’s articles of association.
Dividends are usually due and payable after the shareholders’ resolution relating to the allocation of profits has been passed. 
Under Swiss law, the statute of limitations in respect of dividend payments is five years. 
Annual Report 2023 16
Preemptive and Advance Subscription Rights 
Under Swiss law, any share issue, whether for cash or non-cash consideration or for no consideration, is subject to the prior 
approval of the shareholders’ meeting. Existing shareholders of a Swiss corporation have certain preemptive rights in the event 
of a share issue (Bezugsrechte) and advance subscription rights in the event of the issuance of equity-linked securities 
(Vorwegzeichnungsrechte) to subscribe for the new shares or equity-linked securities, as the case may be, in proportion to the 
nominal amount of shares held. However, the articles of association of the corporation or a resolution approved at a 
shareholders’ meeting by at least two-thirds of the votes and a majority of the nominal value of the shares, in each case 
represented at the meeting, may limit or exclude such preemptive or advance subscription rights in certain limited 
circumstances.
Notices
Notices to shareholders are made by publication in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce. The BoD may designate further 
means of communication for publishing notices to shareholders.
Mandatory Tender Offer
Under the applicable provisions of the Swiss Financial Market Infrastructure Act, anyone who directly or indirectly or acting in 
concert with third parties acquires more than 33 1/3% of the voting rights (whether exercisable or not) of a Swiss-listed 
company will have to submit a takeover bid to acquire all other listed equity securities of such company. A waiver from the 
mandatory bid rule may be granted by the Swiss Takeover Board or the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority 
FINMA. If no waiver is granted, the mandatory takeover bid must be made pursuant to the procedural rules set forth in the 
Swiss Financial Market Infrastructure Act and its implementing ordinances.
Board of Directors 
Borrowing Power
Neither Swiss law nor the Articles restrict in any way our power to borrow and raise funds, provided that any such borrowing 
is entered into on arms’ length terms.
UBS Group AG, as a listed company, may grant loans to members of its BoD based on the Articles. The Articles restrict UBS 
Group AG’s ability to grant loans to BoD members as follows: First, loans to the independent members of the BoD shall be 
made in accordance with the customary business and market conditions. Second, loans to the non-independent members of the 
BoD shall be made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms as those granted to UBS employees. 
Third, the total amount of such loans shall not exceed CHF 20m per member.
Conflicts of Interests
Swiss law requires directors and members of senior management to inform the BoD immediately and comprehensively of any 
conflicts of interest affecting them. The BoD then has to take the measures required to safeguard the interests of the 
corporation. Directors and officers are personally liable to the corporation for any breach of these provisions. In addition, 
Swiss law contains a provision under which payments made to a shareholder or a director or any person associated therewith, 
other than at arm’s length, must be repaid to the corporation if the shareholder or director was acting in bad faith. 
In addition, the Organization Regulations provide that the member of the BoD or senior management with a conflict of interest 
shall participate in discussions and a double vote (meaning a vote with and a vote without the conflicted individual) shall take 
place. A binding decision on the matter requires the same outcome in both votes. This is subject to exceptional circumstances 
in which the best interests of UBS dictate that the member of the BoD or senior management with a conflict of interest shall 
not participate in the discussions and decision-making involving the interest at stake. 
Retirement of Board Members
There is no age-limit requirement for retirement of the members of the BoD. The term of office for each BoD member is until 
the next annual general meeting of shareholders, and no BoD member may serve for more than 10 consecutive terms of office. 
In exceptional circumstances the BoD can extend this limit.
Annual Report 2023 17
The Company
Repurchase of Shares
Swiss law limits a corporation’s ability to hold or repurchase its own shares. We and our subsidiaries may repurchase shares 
only if and to the extent that (i) we have freely distributable reserves in the amount of the purchase price and (ii) the aggregate 
nominal value of all shares held by us and our subsidiaries does not exceed 10% of our nominal share capital (or 20% of our 
nominal share capital in specific circumstances). Repurchases for cancellation purposes approved by the shareholders’ meeting 
are not subject to the 10% threshold for own shares within the meaning of article 659 paragraph 2 of the Swiss Code of 
Obligations. We must create a special reserve in our standalone financial statements prepared in accordance with Swiss law in 
the amount of the purchase price of any repurchased shares. Furthermore, in our consolidated financial statements, own shares 
are recorded at cost and reported as treasury shares, resulting in a reduction in total shareholders’ equity. Shares held by us or 
any of our subsidiaries do not carry any rights to vote at shareholders’ meetings.
Sinking Fund Provisions
There are no provisions in Swiss law or in the Articles requiring us to put resources aside for the exclusive purpose of 
redeeming bonds or repurchasing shares.
Registration and Business Purpose
UBS Group AG was incorporated and registered as a corporation limited by shares (Aktiengesellschaft) under the laws of 
Switzerland. UBS Group AG was entered into the commercial register of Canton Zurich on June 10, 2014 under the 
registration number CHE-395.345.924 and has its registered domicile in Zurich, Switzerland. The business purpose of UBS 
Group AG, as set forth in article 2 of the Articles, is the acquisition, holding, management and sale of direct and indirect 
participations in enterprises of any kind, in particular in the area of banking, financial, advisory, trading and service activities 
in Switzerland and abroad. UBS Group AG may establish enterprises of any kind in Switzerland and abroad, hold equity 
interests in these companies, and conduct their management. UBS Group AG is authorized to acquire, mortgage and sell real 
estate and building rights in Switzerland and abroad. UBS Group AG may provide loans, guarantees and other types of 
financing and security for group companies and borrow and invest capital on the money and capital markets.
Duration and Liquidation 
UBS Group AG has an unlimited duration. 
Under Swiss law, we may be dissolved at any time by way of liquidation or in the case of a merger in accordance with the 
Swiss Federal Act on Merger, Demerger, Transformation of Assets of October 3, 2002, as amended, based on a resolution 
passed at a shareholders’ meeting with the approval of at least a two-thirds majority of the votes, and a majority of the nominal 
value of shares, in each case represented at such meeting. As UBS Group AG is the Swiss parent of a financial group, the 
Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA is the only competent authority to open restructuring or liquidation 
(bankruptcy) proceedings with respect to UBS Group AG.
Under Swiss law, any surplus arising out of a liquidation (after the settlement of all claims of all creditors) must be used first to 
repay the nominal share capital of UBS Group AG. Thereafter, any balance must be distributed to shareholders in proportion to 
the paid-up nominal value of shares held. 
Other
Ernst & Young Ltd, Aeschengraben 9, 4051 Basel, Switzerland, PCAOB number 1460, have been appointed as statutory 
auditors and as auditors of the consolidated accounts of UBS Group AG. The auditors are subject to election each year by the 
shareholders at the annual general meeting. 
Annual Report 2023 18
E—Taxation. 
This section outlines the material Swiss tax and US federal income tax consequences of the ownership of UBS Group AG's 
ordinary shares (defined as "UBS ordinary shares " in this section) by a US holder (as defined below) who holds UBS ordinary 
shares as capital assets. This discussion addresses only US federal income taxation and Swiss income and capital taxation and 
does not discuss all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to holders in light of their individual circumstances, including 
other foreign tax consequences, state or local tax consequences, estate and gift tax consequences, and tax consequences arising 
under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. It is designed to explain the 
major interactions between Swiss and US taxation for US persons who hold UBS ordinary shares. 
The discussion does not address the tax consequences to persons who hold UBS ordinary shares in particular circumstances, 
such as tax-exempt entities, banks, financial institutions, life insurance companies, broker-dealers, traders in securities that 
elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings, holders that actually or constructively own 10% or 
more of the total combined voting power of the voting stock of UBS Group AG or of the total value of stock of UBS Group 
AG, holders that hold UBS ordinary shares as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, holders that purchase or 
sell UBS ordinary shares as part of a wash sale for tax purposes or holders whose functional currency for US tax purposes is 
not the US dollar. This discussion also does not apply to holders who acquired their UBS ordinary shares through a taxqualified retirement plan, nor generally to unvested UBS ordinary shares held under deferred compensation arrangements. 
If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes) holds UBS ordinary shares, the US 
federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the 
partnership. A partner in a partnership holding the UBS ordinary shares should consult its tax advisor with regard to the US 
federal income tax treatment of an investment in the ordinary shares.
The discussion is based on the tax laws of Switzerland and the United States, including the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations under the Internal Revenue Code, published rulings and 
court decisions, as in effect on the date of this document, as well as the Convention between the United States of America and 
the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income (the “Treaty”), all of which 
may be subject to change or change in interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect. 
For purposes of this discussion, a “US holder” is any beneficial owner of UBS ordinary shares that is for US federal income 
tax purposes: 
• A citizen or resident of the United States;
• A domestic corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation;
• An estate, the income of which is subject to US federal income tax without regard to its source; or
• A trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust 
and one or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
Holders of UBS ordinary shares are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the US federal, state and local and the Swiss 
and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of these shares in their particular circumstances.
 (a) Ownership of UBS Ordinary Shares - Swiss Taxation
Dividends and Distributions
Dividends paid by UBS Group AG to a holder of UBS ordinary shares (including dividends on liquidation proceeds and stock 
dividends) are in principle subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35%. 
Under the Capital Contribution Principle, the repayment of capital contributions, including share premiums made by the 
shareholders after December 31, 1996 is in principle no longer subject to Swiss withholding tax if certain requirements 
regarding the booking of these capital contributions are met. 
Swiss companies listed on a Swiss stock exchange such as UBS Group AG can repay reserves from capital contributions to 
their shareholders without deduction of Swiss withholding tax only if they distribute at least the same amount of taxable 
dividends. For this reason UBS Group AG pays half of the dividend from capital contribution reserves and half of the dividend 
from taxable dividends which is subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax.
Annual Report 2023 19
A US holder resident in the US that qualifies for Treaty benefits may apply for a refund of the withholding tax withheld in 
excess of the 15% Treaty rate (or for a full refund in case of qualifying retirement arrangements). The claim for refund must be 
filed with the Swiss Federal Tax Administration, Eigerstrasse 65, CH-3003 Berne, Switzerland no later than December 31 of 
the third year following the end of the calendar year in which the income subject to withholding was due. The form used for 
obtaining a refund is one of the Swiss Tax Forms 82 (82 C for US companies; 82 E for other US entities; 82 I for individuals; 
82 R for regulated investment companies), which may be obtained from the Swiss Federal Tax Administration at the address 
above or downloaded from the web page of the Swiss Federal tax Administration. The form must be filled out in triplicate with 
each copy duly completed and signed before a notary public in the United States. The form must be accompanied by evidence 
of the deduction of withholding tax withheld at the source. 
A US holder resident outside the US may be eligible for a withholding tax reclaim. If the US holder is resident in Switzerland, 
a full reclaim based on the Swiss withholding tax Act is possible provided all necessary conditions are met. A US holder 
resident neither in the US nor in Switzerland may be eligible for a partial reclaim provided that a Treaty between Switzerland 
and the country of residence is applicable and that all necessary conditions are met.
Transfers of UBS Ordinary Shares
The purchase or sale of UBS ordinary shares, whether by Swiss resident or non-resident holders (including US holders), may 
be subject to a Swiss securities transfer stamp duty of up to 0.15% calculated on the purchase price or sale proceeds if it occurs 
through or with a bank or other securities dealer as defined in the Swiss Federal Stamp Tax Act in Switzerland or the 
Principality of Liechtenstein. In addition to the stamp duty, the sale of UBS ordinary shares by or through a member of a 
recognized stock exchange may be subject to a stock exchange levy. 
Capital gains realized by a US holder upon the sale of UBS ordinary shares are not subject to Swiss income or gains taxes, 
unless such US holder holds such shares as business assets of a Swiss business operation qualifying as a permanent 
establishment. In the latter case, gains are taxed at ordinary Swiss individual or corporate income tax rates, as the case may be, 
and losses are deductible for purposes of Swiss income taxes. Furthermore, a US holder who is an individual resident in 
Switzerland and holds such shares as business assets (as he qualifies as a professional trader of securities as per Swiss tax law) 
may be liable to Swiss income taxes on gains.
(b) Ownership of UBS Ordinary Shares - US Federal Income Taxation
The tax treatment of the UBS ordinary shares will depend in part on whether or not UBS Group AG is classified as a passive 
foreign investment company, or PFIC, for US federal income tax purposes. Except as discussed below under “—Passive 
Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) Rules”, this discussion assumes that UBS Group AG is not classified as a PFIC for 
United States federal income tax purposes.
Dividends and Distributions
A US holder will include in gross income and treat as a dividend the gross amount of any distribution paid, before reduction 
for Swiss withholding taxes, by UBS Group AG out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US 
federal income tax purposes), other than certain pro-rata distributions of UBS ordinary shares, when the distribution is actually 
or constructively received by the US holder. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits (as 
determined for US federal income tax purposes) will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the US holder’s basis in its 
UBS ordinary shares and thereafter as capital gain. However, UBS Group AG does not expect to calculate earnings and profits 
in accordance with US federal income tax principles. Accordingly, a US holder should expect to generally treat distributions 
made on UBS ordinary shares as dividends.
Dividends paid to a noncorporate US holder that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to the holder at 
preferential rates, provided that the holder has a holding period in the shares of more than 60 days during the 121-day period 
beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meets other holding period requirements. Dividends paid by UBS Group 
AG with respect to the ordinary shares will generally be qualified dividend income provided that, in the year that the US holder 
receives the dividend, the UBS ordinary shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. 
The UBS ordinary shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and UBS Group AG therefore expects that dividends 
will be qualified dividend income.
For US federal income tax purposes, a dividend will include a distribution characterized under Swiss law as a repayment of 
capital contributions if the distribution is made out of current or accumulated earnings and profits, as described above.
Dividends will generally be income from sources outside the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes, and will 
generally be "passive" income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to the holder. However, if (a) we are 
50% or more owned, by vote or value, by US persons and (b) at least 10% of our earnings and profits are attributable to 
sources within the United States, then for foreign tax credit purposes, a portion of our dividends would be treated as derived 
from sources within the United States. With respect to any dividend paid for any taxable year, the US source ratio of our 
dividends for foreign tax credit purposes would be equal to the portion of our earnings and profits from sources within the 
United States for such taxable year, divided by the total amount of our earnings and profits for such taxable year. Special rules 
apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to preferential rates. The 
dividend will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends 
received from other US corporations.
Annual Report 2023 20
Dividends on the UBS ordinary shares are taxable to a US holder when the US holder receives the dividends, actually or 
constructively. In the case of dividends that are paid in Swiss francs, the amount of the dividend distribution included in 
income of a US holder will be the US dollar value of the Swiss franc payments made, determined at the spot Swiss franc/US 
dollar rate on the date such dividend distribution is includible in the income of the US holder, regardless of whether the 
payment is in fact converted into US dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during 
the period from the date the dividend payment is included in income to the date such dividend payment is converted into US 
dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified 
dividend income. Such gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit 
limitation purposes.
Subject to US foreign tax credit limitations, the nonrefundable Swiss tax withheld and paid over to Switzerland will generally 
be creditable or deductible against the US holder’s US federal income tax liability. Special rules apply in determining the 
foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to the preferential tax rates. To the extent a reduction or 
refund of the tax withheld is available to a US holder under the laws of Switzerland or under the Treaty, the amount of tax 
withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for credit against the US holder’s US federal income tax liability, whether or not 
the refund is actually obtained. See “(a) Ownership of UBS Ordinary Shares – Swiss Taxation” above, for the procedures for 
obtaining a tax refund.
Transfers of UBS Ordinary Shares
A US holder that sells or otherwise disposes of UBS ordinary shares generally will recognize capital gain or loss for US federal 
income tax purposes equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realized and its tax basis, determined in 
US dollars, in such UBS ordinary shares. Capital gain of a non-corporate US holder is generally taxed at preferential rates if 
the UBS ordinary shares were held for more than one year. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources 
within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. A US holder will not be allowed a foreign tax credit in 
respect of any stamp duty or stock exchange levy that is imposed upon a transfer of UBS ordinary shares.
Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) Rules
UBS Group AG believes that it should not currently be classified as a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes, and it does not 
expect to become a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination made annually and 
thus may be subject to change. In addition, UBS Group AG’s current position that it is not currently, and it does not expect to 
become, a PFIC is based on the position that UBS Group AG qualifies for a special rule that treats income recognized by a 
bank in the active conduct of a banking business as active income for PFIC purposes (the “active bank exception”). It is 
possible, however, that UBS Group AG may not satisfy the requirements of the active bank exception in the current or a future 
taxable year, or that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service may issue guidance in the future under which UBS Group AG would 
not satisfy the requirements of the active bank exception. It is therefore possible that UBS Group AG could become a PFIC in 
a future taxable year. In general, UBS Group AG will be a PFIC with respect to a US holder if, for any taxable year in which 
the US holder held UBS ordinary shares, either (i) at least 75% of the gross income of UBS Group AG for the taxable year is 
passive income or (ii) at least 50% of the value, determined on the basis of a quarterly average, of UBS Group AG’s assets is 
attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income (including cash). “Passive income” 
generally includes dividends, interest, gains from the sale or exchange of investment property rents and royalties and certain 
other specified categories of income. If a foreign corporation owns at least 25% by value of the stock of another corporation, 
the foreign corporation is treated for purposes of the PFIC tests as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the other 
corporation, and as receiving directly its proportionate share of the other corporation's income. 
If UBS Group AG were to be treated as a PFIC, special rules apply with respect to (i) any gain a US holder realizes on the sale 
or other disposition of UBS ordinary shares, and (ii) any excess distribution that UBS Group AG makes to a US holder 
(generally, any distributions to the US holder during a single taxable year, other than the taxable year in which the US holder’s 
holding period in the UBS ordinary shares begins, that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by 
the US holder in respect of the UBS ordinary shares during the three preceding taxable years or, if shorter, the US holder’s 
holding period for the UBS ordinary shares that preceded the taxable year in which the US holder receives the distribution). 
Under these rules: (i) the gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the US holder’s holding period for the UBS 
ordinary shares, (ii) the amount allocated to the taxable year in which the US holder realized the gain or excess distribution or 
to prior years before the first year in which UBS Group AG is a PFIC with respect to the US holder will be taxed as ordinary 
income, (iii) the amount allocated to each other prior year will be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for that year, and (iv) 
the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed in respect of the tax attributable to each such 
year.
Special rules apply for calculating the amount of the foreign tax credit with respect to excess distributions by a PFIC. With 
certain exceptions, a US holder’s UBS ordinary shares will be treated as stock in a PFIC if UBS Group AG was a PFIC at any 
time during the holder’s holding period in the UBS ordinary shares. In addition, dividends received from UBS Group AG 
would not be eligible for the preferential tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income if UBS Group AG were to be treated 
as a PFIC either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year, but would instead be taxable at rates 
applicable to ordinary income. If a US holder owns UBS ordinary shares during any year that UBS Group AG is PFIC with 
respect to the US holder, the US holder may be required to file Internal Revenue Service Form 8621.

Annual Report 2023 | Letter to shareholders 2
Dear shareholders,
2023 was a defining moment in the 162-year history of UBS. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group (Credit Suisse) 
was momentous as the first-ever combination of two global systemically important financial institutions (G-SIFIs). As that 
extraordinary weekend in March 2023 unfolded, the Swiss financial center was a source of worry, even embarrassment, 
for many in the country. One of its largest banks was on the brink of collapse after years of reputational and financial 
distress. Two days later, with UBS, the government found a Swiss solution that will benefit our stakeholders and 
strengthen Switzerland’s role as a global leader in wealth management. 
Thanks to our strategy focused on delivering outstanding client services, sustainable profitability, financial strength and 
sound risk management, we were able to answer the call to help stabilize the financial system at home and abroad. The 
Swiss government did not have to execute a resolution plan under the too-big-to-fail regulation, nationalize Credit Suisse 
or call a foreign bank to the rescue. Aside from the idiosyncratic failure of Credit Suisse, the resilience of UBS and other 
large institutions is a testament to the substantial regulatory reforms introduced, and coherently implemented, over the 
past decade. 
The transaction succeeded not just in restoring financial stability and preventing contagion. We are confident it will also 
create enduring value for you, our shareholders. The acquisition vaulted us into a new league by giving us a highly 
complementary footprint in our key markets and increased scale and capabilities. To that end, the acquisition has 
accelerated – not changed – our existing strategy.
By adding client assets equivalent to seven to ten years’ worth of organic growth, the acquisition solidified our primacy 
as a leading and truly global wealth manager and the leading bank in Switzerland, with stronger asset management and 
investment bank franchises. The scale we achieve with the combination and the efficiencies we expect to create will 
enable us to deepen our relationships with clients at every level in every geography. And as we position our firm to deliver 
sustainably higher returns and long-term growth, we are committed to maintaining our UBS culture at the heart of 
everything we do. 
Building on a proven track record
Following the transaction, the Board of Directors asked Sergio Ermotti, who had previously served as Group CEO from 
2011 to 2020, to return in April 2023. Sergio has committed to stay at least until the completion of the integration 
process, if not longer. Additionally, he is supported by an executive team with a proven track record in managing and 
executing complex restructuring and a qualified and experienced Board of Directors.
We recognize the extraordinary responsibility with which we have been entrusted with the Credit Suisse acquisition. 
Although we expect to forego until 2027 the levels of profitability we have previously delivered, it reinforces the promising 
long-term trajectory for our firm, our clients, our industry and the communities where we live and work.
The need to build scale and efficiencies to enhance capabilities and services for clients, often through inorganic growth, 
is a reality for every company in every industry, and we are no exception. Dating back to its founding as The Bank in 
Winterthur in 1862, UBS can claim a heritage of consolidation encompassing more than 500 different firms, from 
cantonal and regional banks that needed saving, to wealth managers and Wall Street brokerages. Many of these 
enterprises contribute to the DNA of today’s UBS. Credit Suisse, adding its own legacy brands such as Schweizerische 
Kreditanstalt, First Boston, Bank Leu and Swiss Volksbank, joins a family of historic franchises, including PaineWebber, 
S.G. Warburg, Swiss Bank Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland, to name just a few. 
Integration at pace
Since the acquisition closed in June 2023, we have been off to a strong start in enabling Credit Suisse’s marketcompetitive franchises and talented people to flourish and make us even stronger. Our immediate focus was on stabilizing 
Credit Suisse’s client base and employees. At the same time, we began swiftly executing our integration plans, which we 
aim to substantially complete by the end of 2026. 
We made significant progress on these ambitions in 2023. We decided to integrate Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG, following 
a careful review of strategic options, and defined the new Non-core and Legacy perimeter. 
Annual Report 2023 | Letter to shareholders 3
We experienced robust momentum in our client win-back initiatives, as evidenced by net new assets of USD 77 billion in 
Global Wealth Management and USD 77 billion of net new deposits across Global Wealth Management and Personal & 
Corporate Banking since the close. This enabled us to terminate and hand back Swiss government support at the end of 
August. We also repaid Credit Suisse’s emergency liquidity facilities, generating substantial funding cost efficiencies. We 
were also encouraged by the high demand for our first additional tier 1 capital bond issue since the acquisition.
The support that investors extended to us during 2023 has given us confidence and energy as we embark on the next 
phase of the integration. Total shareholder returns in 2023 were 56%1
 including dividends, compared to a 7% return 
for the Swiss Market Index2
 and 20% for the STOXX Europe 600 / Banks.3
 In addition, our cost of funding improved, 
with 5-year credit default swap spreads for UBS AG tightening from 78 basis points at year-end 2022 to 53 basis points 
at year-end 2023.
In 2024, we will continue to restructure and optimize the assets we acquired. Completing the merger of our significant 
legal entities by the end of the third quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals, is a key step in enabling us to 
unlock the next phase of the cost, capital and funding synergies that we expect to realize in 2025 and 2026.
Our financial performance and capital position in 2023
UBS achieved underlying profitability in 2023, despite the fact that Credit Suisse was, and remains, structurally loss 
making. Following the publication of our unaudited fourth quarter 2023 financial report on 6 February 2024, we have 
refined our acquisition-date fair value estimates. This has resulted in certain adjustments to our financials. Full-year profit 
before tax therefore stood at USD 28.7 billion, including USD 27.7 billion of negative goodwill. Capital strength is a key 
pillar of our strategy, and we remain committed to maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons. Our common equity tier 1 
(CET1) capital ratio increased to 14.4% at year-end, comfortably above our guidance as we expect to maintain a CET1 
capital ratio of around 14% throughout the integration timeline. Our year-end CET1 ratio supports us in building capacity 
for higher capital returns while, at the same time, it prepares us to absorb integration charges as we integrate Credit 
Suisse. The CET1 leverage ratio was 4.6%, also in excess of our guidance. We maintained healthy liquidity buffers with 
a liquidity coverage ratio of 216% and a net stable funding ratio of 125%.
Setting UBS’s trajectory for years to come
UBS today boasts an appealing business mix that stands out among global peers. The integration of Credit Suisse has 
further shifted us toward Global Wealth Management, Asset Management and Personal & Corporate Banking. Over a 
third of our risk-weighted assets (RWA) are dedicated to our Global Wealth Management and Asset Management 
businesses, which are attractive from a risk, growth and capital perspective. These businesses generated 60% of our 
revenues in 2023. Roughly another third of our RWA are in Personal & Corporate Banking in Switzerland, a prosperous, 
stable and well-diversified economy with low historic credit losses. 
In the Investment Bank, we have gained accretive expertise in global banking in key sectors such as technology, healthcare and financial sponsors. In markets, we bolstered our capabilities in services that are most relevant to our clients, 
including execution and research coverage. While we now have a broader and more diversified business, we reduced the 
overall weighting of the Investment Bank to no more than 25% of group RWA.
Our complementary footprints in Asia Pacific have reinforced our leading position in the fastest-growing wealth market. 
With USD 645 billion in invested assets in Global Wealth Management, we have scale as the largest wealth manager in 
the region, supported by our premium brand, a strong Investment Bank with leading research capabilities and our 
significant China presence. We expect Global Wealth Management margins in the region to eventually exceed 40% as 
we capture the benefits of our leadership positions and integration-related synergies. 
In the US, our other key wealth management growth market, we have scope to improve our profitability, also thanks to 
our strengthened investment bank and asset management franchises. In addition, over the next three years, we will build 
out our core banking infrastructure in the US to provide clients with a more comprehensive loan and deposit offering, 
and roll out more products and services to ultra high net worth, family and institutional wealth clients. 
We will further leverage our advisory capabilities in the US through our global Chief Investment Office platform. Our 
international clients who have interests in the US will benefit from better access to our American advisors and products. 
These actions will help produce mid-teen profit margins by the end of 2026 and put us in a position to explore 
opportunities to further narrow the gap to our peers.

Fit for the future
We intend to remain at the forefront of technological change, providing a more personalized, relevant, on-time and 
seamless experience for our clients. We will continue to invest and innovate to benefit our clients and shareholders.
While we remain focused on providing world-class digital-led solutions, recent geopolitical, macroeconomic and societal 
shifts have highlighted the relevance of our core values such as superior service, security and stability. We are convinced 
that technology will continue to boost our ability to help our clients manage risks and capture opportunities in good 
times as well as during moments of economic uncertainty and geopolitical instability. 
Most importantly, however, it will be our employees that determine our future success as they continue to shape our 
bank for clients and shareholders today and generations to come. We want our employees to be able to build long and 
successful careers, driving innovation for our stakeholders. Investing in our people and culture therefore remains a key 
priority. Together with Credit Suisse, we invested more than USD 100 million in training activities in 2023. 
Our targets and capital returns
While our financial progress in the integration of Credit Suisse will not be delivered in a straight line, our ambitions are 
clear. We aim to realize an underlying return on CET1 capital of around 15% and a cost-to-income ratio of less than 
70% as we exit 2026. By the end of 2028, we endeavor to achieve a return on CET1 capital of around 18%. We expect 
the execution of our integration plans and the run-down of Non-core and Legacy to result in around USD 13 billion in 
gross cost saves by the end of 2026, with around 45% of the cumulative gross cost reductions expected by the end of 
2024. This will provide us with capacity to invest in talent, products and services, and reinforce the resilience of our 
infrastructure.
As we follow through on the integration, we remain focused on client retention and win-back initiatives, while also 
taking actions to improve capital efficiency. We will aim to capture around USD 100 billion of net new assets per annum 
through 2025, building to around USD 200 billion per annum by 2028 and surpassing USD 5 trillion of invested assets in 
Global Wealth Management by the end of 2028.
In 2023, we bought back USD 1.3 billion of our shares before the acquisition required us to temporarily suspend share 
repurchases. In 2024, we expect to repurchase up to USD 1 billion of our shares, commencing after the completion of 
the merger of UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG, which is expected to occur by the end of the second quarter of 2024. 
At the upcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM), the Board of Directors intends to propose an ordinary dividend per 
share of USD 0.70 for the 2023 financial year, a 27% year-on-year increase. We remain committed to progressive 
dividends and are accruing for a mid-teen percentage increase in the dividend per share for the 2024 financial year. Our 
goal is for share repurchases to exceed our pre-acquisition levels by 2026.

Our sustainability ambition
We remain steadfast in our ambition to be a global leader in sustainability. This is underpinned by our continued 
commitment to supporting our clients in the transition to a low-carbon world, leading by example in our own operations, 
and sharing our lessons learned along the way. 
Recognizing the acquisition of Credit Suisse has increased our exposures to certain carbon-intensive sectors, we have 
expanded our Sustainability & Climate Risk framework and associated processes to reflect the full suite of activities of the 
combined business and ensure a consistent approach. We have also moved swiftly to transition portfolios in carbonintensive sectors that do not align with our approach and risk appetite into Non-Core and Legacy to be managed off our 
balance sheet over time.
In addition, we have established new baselines and set decarbonization targets for 2030 across seven key sectors: fossil 
fuels, power generation, iron and steel, cement, Swiss residential real estate, Swiss commercial real estate, and shipping, 
using the latest science-based pathways available to us. We believe these targets are among the most ambitious in the 
industry. By way of example, our target for the fossil fuel sector is to reduce our absolute financed emissions by 70% 
from the 2021 baseline to 2030.
We are proud of the progress we have made so far. We remain committed to our ambition to achieve net-zero 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our scope 1 and 2, and specified scope 3 activities by 2050, with decarbonization 
targets for 2025, 2030 and 2035. At the same time, we fully acknowledge we have more work to do, in phasing in 
additional scope 3 activities and further embedding our new targets. For more information, please refer to our UBS Group 
Sustainability Report 2023.
By working collectively, philanthropists and public and private organizations have the potential to create lasting change 
and maximize a positive impact for people and planet. To this end, we also provide comprehensive advice, insights and 
execution services, working with our clients and finding ways to tackle some of the world’s most pressing social and 
environmental problems. We aim to mobilize USD 1 billion in philanthropic capital and positively impact more than 
26.5 million people by 2025 (cumulative total since 2021). 
In 2023, the UBS Optimus network of foundations raised USD 328 million in donations, including UBS matching 
contributions, and committed USD 306 million in grants from Optimus. Our engagement addressed humanitarian crises 
around the globe in 2023. Optimus also continued to distribute the USD 56 million raised for the Ukraine Relief Fund 
launched in 2022. To date, USD 43 million has been granted to our partners on the ground.
Lessons learned
The failure of Credit Suisse and some US regional financial institutions in the first half of 2023 will unquestionably provide 
global investors, managers, policymakers and regulators alike with important lessons. Most of the post-mortems from 
regulators and expert bodies since March 2023 have devised specific recommendations in the areas of supervision, stress 
testing, liquidity and accountability. We endorse many of these targeted adjustments and will continue to actively 
contribute to this discussion. 
But having analyzed the causes of Credit Suisse’s troubles following the takeover, we have some clear takeaways. First, 
there can be no regulatory solution for a broken business model. That is a job for executives and managers who must 
also be held accountable by engaged shareholders. And second, trust cannot be regulated. 
Furthermore, it was not a lack of capital that forced Credit Suisse into a historic weekend rescue. The capital requirements 
for G-SIFIs have been transformed over the past 15 years, bolstering the resilience of the world’s largest banks and the 
safety of the financial system. Effective loss-absorbing capacity increased around 20-fold since the 2008 global financial 
crisis, and at our firm now is around USD 200 billion. 
The fact that we were in a position to rescue Credit Suisse, despite both firms operating under the same regulatory 
regime, shows the framework and capital requirements were not the problem. This has also been confirmed by various 
international and domestic experts. Therefore, we welcome the ongoing analysis by the Swiss parliamentary commission 
into the collapse of Credit Suisse, so that appropriate and focused actions can be taken both in respect of how regulation 
is potentially fine-tuned and subsequently implemented.
Annual Report 2023 | Letter to shareholders 6
A pillar for Switzerland
There has been much debate about our size relative to the Swiss economy and its impact on competition. We are 
convinced that our size and business model are fit for the purpose for which they are intended: to act as an engine of 
credit creation and prosperity to our clients and the economies we serve. 
It is important to consider the composition and risk profile of the balance sheet, as not every position represents the same 
risk. We hold around 20% of total assets in high-quality liquid assets and another 15% in private client mortgages, which 
bear very low risk. When looking at the risk profile of a balance sheet, it is crucial to look at risk-weighted assets, which 
totaled around USD 547 billion at year-end and are expected to further decrease. We expect our Group RWA to be at 
around USD 510 billion by the end of 2026, which are supported by our strong capital position, including around 
USD 200 billion of loss-absorbing capacity.
The collapse of Credit Suisse unleashed an extraordinary race for clients, talent and market share in the Swiss banking 
market. This is the ultimate proof that the competition provided by both domestic and foreign banks active in Switzerland 
is robust. 
Over the past decade, UBS, Credit Suisse and our combined staff paid around CHF 25 billion in Swiss taxes and bought 
some CHF 3.5 billion in goods and services in Switzerland as well. Last year we collectively offered more than 2,300 
trainee positions – a number we pledge to maintain in 2024 as well. 
We are convinced that the acquisition will make us an even better diversified and stronger pillar in Switzerland, and an 
even more reliable economic partner, employer and taxpayer in the communities where we operate.
The 2024 Annual General Meeting
At the upcoming AGM, we are proposing Gail Kelly for election to the Board of Directors as Dieter Wemmer will not 
stand for re-election after eight years of Board membership. We thank him for his invaluable collaboration and significant 
contribution to the strong governance at our firm. Gail has an outstanding reputation as one of the most influential 
voices in the Asia-Pacific financial industry and an acknowledged leader. She is recognized as an excellent bank CEO who 
successfully navigated a merger. You will also be asked to vote on our first combined UBS Group Sustainability Report 
and the proposed increase in dividends. 
We are excited about our long-term value proposition. Our strategy is clear and augmented by the acquisition of Credit 
Suisse. We have an opportunity to create an even better experience for clients while generating sustainably higher returns 
on capital and allowing us to provide you, our shareholders, with attractive shareholder returns.
Thank you for your support in one of the most decisive years in our history. We look forward to your feedback and to 
welcoming you to the 2024 AGM, which will take place on 24 April in Basel, Switzerland.
Yours sincerely,
Colm Kelleher Sergio P. Ermotti
Chairman of the Board of Directors Group Chief Executive Officer

2020. Refer to the “Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet” section of this report for more information. 8 The disclosed ratios represent averages for the fourth quarter of each year presented, which were 
calculated based on an average of 63 data points in the fourth quarter of 2023, 63 data points in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 66 data points in the fourth quarter of 2021. Refer to the “Capital, liquidity and

Invested assets and net new money” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report for more information. 10 Starting with the second quarter of 2023, invested assets include invested assets from 
associates in the Asset Management business division, to better reflect the business strategy. Comparative figures have been restated to reflect this change. 11 Refer to “UBS shares” in the “Capital, liquidity and 
funding, and balance sheet” section of this report for more information. 12 In the second quarter of 2023, the calculation of market capitalization was amended to reflect total shares issued multiplied by the share 
price at the end of the period. The calculation was previously based on total shares outstanding multiplied by the share price at the end of the period. Market capitalization has been increased by USD 7.8bn as of 
31 December 2022 and by USD 5.5bn as of 31 December 2021 as a result.
Adjustment made within the IFRS 3 measurement period after publication of the fourth quarter 2023 
report
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in the second quarter of 2023 resulted in provisional negative goodwill of 
USD 28.9bn. Following the publication of the unaudited fourth quarter 2023 report on 6 February 2024, UBS has 
refined its acquisition-date fair value estimates in accordance with the 12-month measurement period requirements 
provided by IFRS 3, Business Combinations. This has resulted in an adjustment of USD 1.2bn, decreasing the negative 
goodwill to USD 27.7bn. As a result, 2023 operating profit before tax and 2023 net profit attributable to shareholders 
decreased by USD 1.2bn, basic earnings per share decreased by USD 0.38 to USD 8.83 and diluted earnings per share 
decreased by USD 0.36 to USD 8.45. In addition, the CET1 capital ratio decreased to 14.4% from 14.5%.

Alternative performance measures
An alternative performance measure (an APM) is a financial measure of historical or future financial performance, financial 
position or cash flows other than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable recognized accounting 
standards or in other applicable regulations. We report a number of APMs in the discussion of the financial and operating 
performance of the Group, our business divisions and Group Items. We use APMs to provide a more complete picture of 
our operating performance and to reflect management’s view of the fundamental drivers of our business results. A 
definition of each APM, the method used to calculate it and the information content are presented under “Alternative 
performance measures” in the appendix to this report. Our APMs may qualify as non-GAAP measures as defined by US 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. Our underlying results are APMs and are non-GAAP financial 
measures.

Our Board of Directors
The Board of Directors of UBS Group AG (the BoD), led by the Chairman, consists of between 6 and 12 members, as per our 
Articles of Association. The BoD decides on the strategy of the Group, upon recommendation by the Group Chief Executive Officer 
(the Group CEO), and is responsible for the overall direction, supervision and control of the Group and its management. It is also 
responsible for supervising compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The BoD exercises oversight over UBS Group 
AG and its subsidiaries, and is responsible for establishing a clear Group governance framework to provide effective steering and 
supervision of the Group, taking into account the material risks to which UBS Group AG and its subsidiaries are exposed. The BoD 
has ultimate responsibility for the success of the Group and for delivering sustainable shareholder value within a framework of 
prudent and effective controls. It approves all financial statements and appoints and removes all Group Executive Board 
(GEB) members. 
Our Group Executive Board
UBS Group AG operates under a strict dual-board structure, as mandated by Swiss banking law, and therefore the BoD delegates 
the management of the business to the GEB. As of 31 December 2023, the GEB, under the leadership of the Group CEO, 
consisted of 16 members. It has executive management responsibility for the steering of the Group and its business, develops 
the strategies of the Group, business divisions and Group Items, and implements the BoD-approved strategies.

Annual Report 2023 16
Our evolution
Since our origins in the mid-19th century, more than 500 different firms have become part of the history of our firm and 
helped shape our development. 1998 was a major turning point: two of the three largest Swiss banks, Union Bank of 
Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC), merged to form UBS. Both banks were well established and successful in 
their own right. Union Bank of Switzerland had grown organically to become the largest Swiss bank. In contrast, SBC 
had grown mainly through strategic partnerships and acquisitions, including S.G. Warburg in 1995.
In 2000, we acquired PaineWebber, a US brokerage and asset management firm with roots going back to 1879, 
establishing us as a significant player in the US. Since 1964, we have been building our strong presence in the Asia Pacific 
region, where we are by far the largest wealth manager,1
 with asset management and investment banking capabilities.
After incurring significant losses in the 2008 financial crisis, we sought to return to our roots, emphasizing a client-centric 
model that requires less risk-taking and capital. In 2011, we started a strategic transformation of our business model to 
focus on our traditional businesses: wealth management globally, and personal and corporate banking in Switzerland.
In 2014, we began adapting our legal entity structure in response to too-big-to-fail requirements and other regulatory 
initiatives. First, we established UBS Group AG as the ultimate parent holding company for the Group. In 2015, we 
transferred personal and corporate banking and Swiss-booked wealth management businesses from UBS AG to the 
newly established UBS Switzerland AG. That same year, we set up UBS Business Solutions AG as the Group’s service 
company. In 2016, UBS Americas Holding LLC became the intermediate holding company for our US subsidiaries and 
our wealth management subsidiaries across Europe were merged into UBS Europe SE, our Germany-headquartered 
European subsidiary. In 2019, we merged UBS Limited, our UK-headquartered subsidiary, into UBS Europe SE.
2023 was another defining moment in our 162-year history as we acquired the Credit Suisse Group, a global systemically 
important financial institution and a major wealth manager headquartered in Switzerland that was founded in 1856. The 
acquisition followed a request from the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss 
Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG to duly consider the 
acquisition in order to restore necessary confidence in the stability of the Swiss economy and banking system and to 
serve the best interests of the shareholders and stakeholders of UBS and Credit Suisse. 
The acquisition strengthened our position today as a leading and truly global wealth manager, the leading bank in 
Switzerland, a global, large-scale and diversified asset manager, and a focused investment bank.

Acquisition and integration of Credit Suisse
Acquisition of Credit Suisse
On 12 June 2023, UBS Group AG acquired Credit Suisse Group AG, succeeding by operation of Swiss law to all assets 
and liabilities of Credit Suisse Group AG, and became the direct or indirect shareholder of all of the former direct and 
indirect subsidiaries of Credit Suisse Group AG (the Transaction). 
The acquisition followed a request from the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss 
Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to both firms to duly consider the Transaction in order to restore necessary 
confidence in the stability of the Swiss economy and banking system and to serve the best interests of the shareholders 
and stakeholders of UBS and Credit Suisse. As a result of further negotiations and supported by distinct government 
guarantees and measures, the firms subsequently entered into a merger agreement on 19 March 2023. 
Upon the completion of the Transaction, each outstanding registered Credit Suisse Group AG share converted to the 
right to receive, subject to the payment of certain fees to the Credit Suisse Depositary in the case of Credit Suisse 
American depositary shares (ADS), a merger consideration consisting of 1/22.48 UBS Group AG shares. In aggregate, 
Credit Suisse Group AG shareholders received 5.1% of the outstanding UBS Group AG shares on the acquisition date, 
with a purchase price of USD 3.7bn.
UBS has accounted for the acquisition as a business combination under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, applying the 
acquisition method of accounting.

in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report
Integration of Credit Suisse
We are successfully executing our integration plans. We have stabilized the franchise and successfully won back, retained 
and grown client assets, as we have been entrusted with USD 77bn of net new assets since the acquisition. We achieved 
underlying profitability, which enabled us to pay down the extraordinary liquidity support and to voluntarily terminate 
the loss protection agreement guaranteed by the Swiss government, reducing our funding costs by around USD 550m 
per quarter. On 22 March 2024, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG repaid loans drawn under the Emergency Liquidity Assistance 
(ELA) facility, reducing the amount of loans outstanding under the ELA from CHF 38bn to CHF 19bn as of that date. We 
achieved around USD 4bn in exit rate gross cost savings as of the end of 2023 compared with the full year 2022 for UBS 
and the Credit Suisse Group combined. We established the perimeter for Non-core and Legacy, and our strategy for the 
wind-down of Non-core and Legacy led to reductions of USD 12bn in risk-weighted assets, nearly 80% of which came 
from unwinds. We also provided important clarity for all of our stakeholders as we finalized our target operating model 
and initiated the restructuring phase. We aim to substantially complete the integration by the end of 2026.
Beginning with the third quarter of 2023, we report five business divisions, reflecting the way we manage our businesses 
and engage with clients: Global Wealth Management, Personal & Corporate Banking, Asset Management, the Investment 
Bank, and Non-core and Legacy. We separately report Group Items.
Non-core and Legacy includes positions and businesses not aligned with our strategy and policies. Those consist of the 
assets and liabilities that prior to the acquisition were reported as part of the Capital Release Unit (Credit Suisse) and 
certain assets and liabilities of the Investment Bank (Credit Suisse), Wealth Management (Credit Suisse), Swiss Bank 
(Credit Suisse) and Asset Management (Credit Suisse) divisions, as well as of the Corporate Center (Credit Suisse). Also 
included are the remaining assets and liabilities of UBS’s Non-core and Legacy Portfolio, previously reported in Group 
Functions, and smaller amounts of assets and liabilities of UBS’s business divisions that we have assessed as not strategic 
in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
Legal structure integration
In December 2023, the Board of Directors of UBS Group AG approved the merger of UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG, and 
both entities entered into a definitive merger agreement. The completion of the merger is subject to regulatory approvals 
and is expected to occur by the end of the second quarter of 2024. We also expect to complete the transition to a single 
US intermediate holding company in the second quarter of 2024 and the planned merger of UBS Switzerland AG and 
Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG in the third quarter of 2024.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Acquisition and integration of Credit Suisse 18
Completing the mergers of our significant legal entities is a critical step in enabling us to unlock the next phase of the 
cost, capital and funding synergies that we expect to realize in 2025 and 2026. These significant-legal-entity mergers are 
a prerequisite for the first wave of client migrations and will enable us to begin streamlining and decommissioning legacy 
Credit Suisse platforms in the second half of 2024.
Material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting of the Credit Suisse Group
As a registrant with the US Security and Exchange Commission (the SEC), UBS Group is subject to requirements under 
the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 with respect to financial reporting. This requires us to perform system and process 
evaluation and testing of internal control over financial reporting to enable management to assess the effectiveness of 
our internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial 
reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a registrant’s financial statements will 
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
In March 2023, prior to acquisition by UBS, the Credit Suisse Group and Credit Suisse AG disclosed that their respective 
management had identified three material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, as a result of which 
each of Credit Suisse Group and Credit Suisse AG concluded that, as of 31 December 2022, their internal control over 
financial reporting was not effective and, for the same reasons, had reached the same conclusion regarding their internal 
control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2021. The material weaknesses identified by Credit Suisse related to 
the failure to design and maintain an effective risk assessment process to identify and analyze the risk of material 
misstatements in Credit Suisse financial statements and the failure to design and maintain effective monitoring activities 
relating to (i) providing sufficient management oversight over the internal control evaluation process to support the 
company’s internal control objectives; (ii) involving appropriate and sufficient management resources to support the risk 
assessment and monitoring objectives; and (iii) assessing and communicating the severity of deficiencies in a timely 
manner to those parties responsible for taking corrective action. These material weaknesses contributed to an additional 
material weakness, as the Credit Suisse Group’s management did not design and maintain effective controls over the 
classification and presentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows under US Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles (“US GAAP”). Specifically, certain control activities over the completeness and the classification and 
presentation of non-cash items in the consolidated statement of cash flows were not performed on a timely basis or at 
the appropriate level of precision. This material weakness resulted in the revisions to Credit Suisse Group’s consolidated 
financial statements for the three years ended 31 December, 2021 as disclosed in its 2021 Annual Report. 
Following the identification of the material weaknesses, Credit Suisse management initiated a remediation program and 
further enhanced its processes and controls over financial reporting, with the key remediation steps to date as follows.
With respect to the material weakness relating to the US GAAP consolidated statement of cash flows, Credit Suisse 
management performed a review of the process to produce the statement, including a third-party review and, as a result, 
enhanced controls within the process and implemented additional controls, including senior management reviews. Based 
on the work completed to date, Credit Suisse management has assessed that the changes to internal control made to 
address the material weakness relating to the classification and presentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
are designed effectively, but that additional time is required to conclude that these controls are operating effectively on 
a sustainable basis.
With respect to the material weaknesses on risk assessment of internal control and severity assessment of control 
deficiencies, Credit Suisse has implemented an enhanced severity assessment framework and additional management 
oversight of severity assessments. The changes to the severity assessment process include updated training and guidance 
on the assessment of the severity of control deficiencies as well as increased management oversight and quality assurance 
over these assessments. In addition, Credit Suisse has augmented its risk assessment process and increased its testing of 
controls. UBS has determined to complete remediation of the internal control risk identification and severity assessment 
weaknesses by integrating Credit Suisse into the UBS internal control risk assessment and evaluation framework in 2024. 
The operating effectiveness of the risk and severity assessment processes will be assessed based on an evaluation of the 
2024 risk assessment and control testing process. In light of the above, Credit Suisse management has concluded that 
the material weaknesses at Credit Suisse were not fully remediated at 31 December 2023.
The material weaknesses result in a risk that a material error may not be detected by Credit Suisse’s internal controls that 
could result in a material misstatement to Credit Suisse’s reported financial results, which are consolidated in UBS Group 
AG’s results.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Acquisition and integration of Credit Suisse 19
Following the acquisition, UBS commenced a review of the processes and systems giving rise to the material weaknesses 
and the remediation program. In addition to the measures taken by Credit Suisse to remediate the material weaknesses 
described above, UBS has taken measures to mitigate the risk that internal control deficiencies at Credit Suisse could 
result in material misstatements to the UBS Group financial statements. UBS has separately tested Credit Suisse internal 
controls deemed higher risk, established processes for production, control and review of IFRS financial data from Credit 
Suisse’s US GAAP based accounting systems for inclusion in the UBS Group consolidation process (including a separate 
process for preparation and control of the UBS Group consolidated statement of cash flows), and conducted detailed 
asset level valuation and substantiation reviews in connection with its purchase accounting.
Under guidance published by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude the processes and controls of certain acquired 
businesses from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the year of acquisition. Accordingly, 
UBS has excluded Credit Suisse entities from UBS management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
as of 31 December 2023.
Our strategy
UBS – who we are
UBS is a leading and truly global wealth manager, enhanced by synergetic investment banking and asset management 
capabilities, and the leading bank in Switzerland. We enable people, institutions and corporations to achieve their goals 
by providing financial advice and solutions. We have a unique capital-generative and well-diversified business model with 
a strong competitive position in our target markets and an attractive long-term outlook on return on capital. Our business 
model, our strong culture, our respected brand with over 160 years of history and our capital prudence have made it 
possible to both grow profits and deliver high return on equity. 
We are focused on driving sustainable long-term growth while maintaining risk and cost discipline
Our objective is to generate value for our shareholders and clients by driving sustainable long-term structural growth, as 
well as capital returns. To accomplish this, we are building on our scale, content and solutions, while remaining disciplined 
on capital, risk and costs. Maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons remains the foundation of our success. This will 
give us the capacity to invest strategically and will enable us to deliver against our financial targets and commercial 
ambitions, which are outlined in the “Targets, capital guidance and ambitions” section of this report.
We benefit from an attractive business mix, with more than one-third of our risk-weighted assets (RWA) in our global 
asset-gathering Global Wealth Management and Asset Management business divisions, which are structurally attractive 
from the risk, growth and capital consumption perspectives and generate more than half of our revenues. Roughly 
another third of our RWA are in Personal & Corporate Banking in Switzerland, an attractive, stable and well-diversified 
economy with low historic credit losses. Furthermore, we operate a capital-efficient Investment Bank business division, 
which is limited to less than 25% of Group RWA (excluding Non-core and Legacy).
Moreover, we are aiming to maximize our impact and that of our clients to create long-term sustainable value. We also 
have a responsibility toward the communities we serve and our employees. We have outlined selected environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) aspirations, which should support our financial and commercial targets.
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group is accelerating our strategy
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group enhances our client franchises by increasing scale while adding complementary 
capabilities and gaining talent. Our strategic focus remains on building out our leading global investment platform. The 
acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group enables us to combine and optimize our resources and to target investments that 
enable us to provide superior levels of client service. Our geographical growth segments will remain the Americas and 
Asia Pacific, with Switzerland remaining our home market. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group will further shift 
our business mix toward wealth management, asset management and our Swiss business. The acquisition also 
strengthens our investment banking capabilities, without compromising our model, as the Investment Bank will consume 
a limited share of the Group’s RWA. 
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Our strategy 20
We have a global, diversified business model
Our invested assets of more than USD 5trn are regionally diversified across the globe. We give our clients access to a 
broader, more relevant and customizable range of solutions, which, together with our thought leadership and 
capabilities, position us well to become their partner of choice. Our strategic ambitions are a reflection of the outlook on 
long-term demographic and social trends affecting wealth distribution, product demand and client experience.
Regionally, more than half of our wealth management clients’ invested assets are in the US, which is the largest wealth 
pool globally, with solid wealth generation. Here we are a top player, and we are focused on improving scale and 
profitability by deepening our relationships with core clients and by building out our digital-supported capabilities and 
banking platform.
In Asia Pacific, which is the fastest-growing wealth market, we are by far the largest wealth manager,1
 and we are 
building on that scale to drive growth. We are further developing our businesses in China and working to offer our 
capabilities in a more cohesive way to our clients in Southeast Asia.
In EMEA, we are focused on improving profitability and driving focused growth by optimizing our domestic footprint and 
providing holistic coverage for entrepreneurs.
Finally, in Switzerland, we have a highly integrated business and aim to reinforce our position as the leading bank. We 
are driving our digital transformation, improving the client experience and focusing on capturing selected growth 
opportunities.
Our growth plans are underpinned by cross-divisional collaboration
We want to serve our clients as one firm. The collaboration between our business divisions is critical to the success of our 
strategy and is a source of competitive advantage. This collaboration also provides further revenue growth potential and 
enables us to better meet client needs in our core wealth and global family and institutional wealth (GFIW) segments 
alike. Our Asset Management business division provides clients with a broad offering and exclusive access to premium 
personalized services, while our investment banking capabilities support our growth plans across the client franchise with 
unique insights, execution, and risk management. Close collaboration between our businesses adds value for clients, 
including access to private markets, alternatives and ESG products, and we are continuously striving to enhance our 
holistic client offering.
Clients are at the center of everything we do
Helping clients to achieve their financial and personal goals is the essence of what we do. We aim to differentiate our 
service by delivering a client experience that is personalized, relevant, on-time and seamless. This is our promise to clients.
With evolving client needs, we are adapting by making our wealth coverage more needs-based, digital and effective. In 
wealth management, our focus remains on our core wealth and GFIW clients, while expanding our coverage of 
entrepreneurs, women and the next generation of wealthy individuals. We are launching and scaling digitally 
customizable services, enhancing personally advised wealth with digital support, and expanding our custom offerings for 
GFIW to cater for the different needs of our clients.

Sustainability drives our ambitions 
We partner with our clients to help them mobilize their capital toward a more sustainable world. Our aim is to meet 
clients’ demands for credible sustainable offerings. We want to be the financial provider of choice for clients that wish 
to mobilize capital toward the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the orderly 
transition to a low-carbon economy, including in Switzerland, where, as the leading bank, we are helping to finance this 
transition.
We are investing in our technology as an enabler for client experience, simplicity and efficiency 
The trusted and personal relationship with our clients across our businesses is evolving. Today, our clients expect us to 
provide our services more seamlessly across the firm in a personalized, relevant and timely fashion, with increasing 
demand for services that are digital first and available anytime and anywhere. This presents an opportunity for us to fully 
embrace technology, through which we aim to differentiate the firm.
We continue to invest in technology, such as Artificial Intelligence, with the goals of improving efficiency and 
effectiveness, driving and enhancing growth and better serving our clients. We believe the continued optimization of our 
processes, our platforms, our organization and our capital resources will help us to achieve this.

Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Targets, capital guidance and ambitions 21
Targets, capital guidance and ambitions
In February 2024, we announced our performance targets and capital guidance for the Group, based on our execution 
of the integration of Credit Suisse to date and the completion of our annual business planning process. We have also set 
ambitions for each of the business divisions that collectively are building blocks toward achieving our targets. 
The graphic below shows our updated financial targets, capital guidance and long-term ambitions. 
We also aim to deliver exit rate gross cost savings of approximately USD 13bn by the end of 2026 compared with the full 
year 2022 for the combined organizations. Gross cost savings will create capacity to reinvest for growth and to enhance 
the resilience of our infrastructure. 
We expect Group risk-weighted assets (RWA) to be around USD 510bn by the end of 2026, assuming constant foreign 
exchange rates, including an estimated USD 25bn day-1 increase for the finalization of Basel III in 2025 (of which 
USD 10bn in Non-core and Legacy) and an increase of around USD 10bn in our core businesses from the alignment of 
Credit Suisse’s risk models to those of UBS. We expect to offset these increases with RWA reductions in Non-core and 
Legacy, with the remaining portfolio there representing around 5% of Group RWA at the end of 2026. We also expect 
a further net decrease in RWA of around USD 15bn resulting from business-led actions to optimize returns on RWA in 
our core businesses.
Additionally, we expect up to USD 1bn of funding cost savings by 2026 compared with 2023 levels.
Our business divisions aim to achieve the following.
– Global Wealth Management: surpass USD 5trn of invested assets over the next five years, with around USD 100bn of 
net new assets annually through 2025, building to around USD 200bn annually by 2028, and an underlying cost / 
income ratio of less than 70% by the end of 2026 (exit rate).
– Personal & Corporate Banking: an underlying cost / income ratio of less than 50% by the end of 2026 (exit rate).
– Asset Management: an underlying cost / income ratio of less than 70% by the end of 2026 (exit rate).
– The Investment Bank: an underlying return on attributed equity of approximately 15% through the cycle, while 
operating with no more than 25% of the Group’s RWA (excluding Non-core and Legacy).
– Non-core and Legacy: an underlying pre-tax loss of less than USD 1bn (exit rate), underlying costs of less than USD 1bn 
(exit rate) and a share of around 5% of Group RWA, all by the end of 2026.
Our aspirations on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters are set forth in “Our focus on sustainability and 
climate” in the “How we create value for our stakeholders” section of this report.
Performance against targets, capital guidance and ambitions is taken into account when determining variable 
compensation.

Our businesses
We operate through five business divisions: Global Wealth Management, Personal & Corporate Banking, Asset 
Management, the Investment Bank and Non-core and Legacy. Our global reach and the breadth of our expertise are the 
major assets setting us apart from our competitors. Our Group functions are support and control functions that provide 
services to the Group. Virtually all costs incurred by the support and control functions are allocated to the business 
divisions, leaving a residual amount that we refer to as Group Items in our segment reporting. Disclosures in this report 
may refer to Group functions as Group Items. 
We see joint efforts as key to our growth, both within and between business divisions. We combine our strengths to 
provide our clients with better, innovative solutions and differentiated offerings, for example, our Global Family & 
Institutional Wealth offering with integrated global coverage. 
Global Wealth Management 
We are a leading and truly global wealth manager and strive to help our clients pursue what matters most to them. We 
are focused on serving the needs of ultra high and high net worth individuals through trusted relationships with our 
advisors, while expanding our specialized services. We offer clients our global reach, our advisory approach led by the 
Chief Investment Office (the CIO) and access to our platform with its broad array of solutions, alongside our premium 
brand. 
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group extended our leading global position, by contributing approximately 
USD 680bn in invested assets and more than 1,500 client advisors globally to our business,1
 across all regions.
Organizational changes 
During the first half of 2023, we took several steps to simplify our organizational structure into four regions: Americas, 
EMEA, Asia Pacific and Switzerland. We also unified key solutions and functions under global leads. This will facilitate 
further convergence and simplification of our global operating model, while retaining the flexibility for local and regional 
differences.
In June 2023, the new Global Wealth Management leadership team overseeing the combined business division following 
the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group was announced, including the creation of a new business unit, Global Wealth 
Management Strategic Clients, which is focused on enabling and delivering to our strategic clients globally, working in 
partnership with our regional business leaders and supported by senior client coverage teams. 
How we do business
Our distinctive approach to wealth management helps our clients pursue what matters most to them by offering advice, 
expertise and solutions, and delivering on our client promise.
Our advice to clients is led by our global CIO, which produces the UBS House View, identifying investment opportunities 
designed to protect and increase our clients’ wealth over the long term. CIO views drive investment recommendations 
for advisory clients and investment decisions for discretionary clients representing more than USD 1.6trn in fee-generating 
assets globally. Since September 2023, the full breadth of CIO content has been made available to clients and advisors 
across the entire firm, including Credit Suisse.
We make available to clients a broad range of securities and investment products. In addition to traditional equity and 
fixed-income securities, our investment specialists source and craft a range of investment products, including separately 
managed accounts (SMAs), structured products, sustainable- and impact-investing products, and alternative investments. 
Our alternative investments offering gives clients access to private markets, including equity, real estate and other real 
assets, and investments in private equity funds and hedge funds. We offer our own private equity multi-manager 
investments and enable clients to access selected single-manager funds and open-ended programs. 
To complement this advice, we provide clients with advice on wealth planning, sustainability-focused and impact 
investing, and corporate and banking services. Our specialist teams also advise on art and collecting, family strategy and 
governance, philanthropy, next generation, and wealth transition.
Our Global Family & Institutional Wealth service model, in collaboration with the Investment Bank, provides specialized 
services to meet the needs of family offices and ultra high net worth clients. For clients with institutional-level trading, 
execution and clearing needs, our Unified Global Markets offers access to the full capabilities of the Global Markets 
business of the Investment Bank.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Our businesses 23
In Asia Pacific and Switzerland, the Direct Investment Insights function on our online banking platform enables clients to 
trade directly based on CIO insights via their smartphones and other digital devices. Advice Compass enables advisors to 
conveniently identify the most relevant ideas and solutions for clients during one-to-one meetings. It should be noted 
that the aforementioned products relate to the UBS AG sub-group only. 
To provide our clients with the full breadth of investment management products and solutions, our Global Lending Unit 
offers extensive mortgage, securities-based and structured lending expertise, catering to sophisticated client lending 
needs.

Our newly established Global Wealth Management Strategic Clients unit aims to deliver the best advice and guidance to 
our strategic client segments, including business owners, female clients, the next generation of wealthy clients, athletes 
and entertainers, and multi-cultural investors. To this end, we have developed a dedicated approach and resources with 
specialized teams supporting our clients in achieving their goals.
We are investing in our operating platforms and tools to better serve our clients’ needs, improve their experience, enhance 
overall advisor productivity and improve our operational resilience. We aim to make our services faster and more 
responsive and offer more convenience to our clients. For example, our Global Wealth Management clients have invested 
more than USD 9bn in UBS My Way, our discretionary mandate solution that enables clients to customize their portfolio 
themselves via the UBS mobile banking app. Additionally, we continue to broaden our offering across asset classes and 
themes, collaborating with best-in-class managers across the most relevant strategies. We are making continuous 
improvements to our direct-to-client digital offerings and have rolled out innovative new solutions, such as UBS My Way 
on mobile, a next-generation discretionary mandate solution that now enables clients to tailor their investments within 
their risk profile to their individual preferences via their mobile devices.
We also closely collaborate across business divisions to deliver our best capabilities to clients. Joint efforts with the 
Investment Bank, Asset Management and selected external partners enable us to offer clients broad access to financing, 
global capital markets and bespoke portfolio solutions. For example, in the US market, the SMA initiative with Asset 
Management continues to gain momentum, with USD 158bn in assets under management.

Competition 
Our main competitors fall into two categories: competitors with a strong position in the Americas but more limited global 
footprints, such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America; and competitors with international footprints 
but with a smaller presence than UBS in the US, such as Julius Baer, BNP Paribas and HSBC. We also compete with fintech 
firms in some regions and products. We have strong positions in the largest region (the US) and the fastest-growing 
regions (Asia Pacific and the Middle East). The size of our global franchise, bespoke cross-divisional solutions and premium 
brand and reputation set us apart and would be difficult to replicate.
1 As of 30 June 2023. 
Personal & Corporate Banking
As the leading bank in Switzerland, we provide a comprehensive range of financial products and services to private, 
corporate and institutional clients. Personal & Corporate Banking is the core of our bank in Switzerland, the only country 
where we operate in all of our business areas. We are fully committed to our home market, as our leading position in 
Switzerland is crucial in terms of sustaining our global brand and the stability of our profits. Drawing on a broad network 
of branches and highly qualified client advisors, complemented by modern digital banking services and customer service 
centers, we are able to serve more than one-third of Swiss households and more than 90% of large Swiss corporations.
Organizational changes
Following the acquisition of Credit Suisse Group AG in June 2023 and based on a thorough strategic review, UBS 
announced on 31 August 2023 its decision to fully integrate Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG with UBS Switzerland AG 
through a merger of the two banks. The legal merger of the two entities is expected to be completed in the third quarter 
of 2024.
The Swiss Bank (Credit Suisse) division is being integrated into Personal & Corporate Banking, and the newly combined 
Swiss business is led by the President UBS Switzerland and President Personal & Corporate Banking. For the time being, 
the Credit Suisse brand will remain in use in Switzerland and the Swiss Bank (Credit Suisse) division will continue to offer 
comprehensive advice and a wide range of financial solutions to private, corporate and institutional clients primarily 
domiciled in Switzerland. The Swiss Bank (Credit Suisse) private clients business franchise serves high net worth, affluent, 
retail and small business clients. In addition, consumer finance services are provided through the BANK-now subsidiary 
and credit card brands through our investment in Swisscard AECS GmbH. The corporate and institutional clients business 
of Swiss Bank (Credit Suisse) serves large corporate clients, small and medium-sized enterprises, institutional clients, 
financial institutions, and commodities traders. Part of the Swiss Bank (Credit Suisse) private clients business is expected 
to be shifted to Global Wealth Management as part of the integration progress. 
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Our businesses 25
How we do business
We provide our personal banking clients with access to a comprehensive, life-cycle-based offering. This includes a broad 
range of basic banking products, from payments to deposits, cards and convenient online and mobile banking, as well 
as lending (predominantly mortgages), investments and retirement planning services. In 2023, UBS was named “Best 
Bank in Switzerland” by Euromoney for the ninth time since 2012. Personal & Corporate Banking works closely with 
Global Wealth Management to provide our clients with access to leading wealth management services.
Our corporate and institutional clients benefit from our financing and investment solutions, in particular access to equity 
and debt capital markets, syndicated and structured credit, private placements, leasing, and traditional financing. We 
offer transaction banking solutions for payment and cash management services, trade and export finance, and global 
custody solutions for institutional clients.
Personal & Corporate Banking works closely with the Investment Bank to offer capital market and foreign exchange 
products, hedging strategies, and trading capabilities, as well as corporate finance advice. In cooperation with Asset 
Management, we also provide fund and portfolio management solutions.
In 2023, we continued to support our clients’ sustainability ambitions. In the corporate client segment, we further 
expanded our client-centric approach and focused on supporting our clients by advising them as part of a strategic 
dialogue and launching a sustainability-linked loan for multi-national corporations. We also took positive steps in 
providing transparency and sustainability insights to our private clients. With the launch of the carbon tracker in the UBS 
key4 mobile banking app, clients can see an estimated carbon footprint for their purchases with UBS credit and debit 
cards and through UBS TWINT, helping them navigate the carbon footprints of their purchases in a relatively simple 
manner.

information about sustainability matters
We are building stronger relationships with our clients during the life cycle of their property ownership and providing 
services along the value chain. With our strategic partner Baloise, we offer Houzy, a leading homeowner platform in 
Switzerland with a nationwide network of qualified craftsmen and comprehensive services through buying, renovation, 
maintenance and sale of property. Services relating to property transactions and promotion financing are provided 
through our partner, Brixel. Our exclusive partnership with SMG Swiss Marketplace Group enables us to extend our 
ecosystem network to Switzerland’s largest real estate portals, such as Homegate and Immoscout24.
Our operations and our competitors
We operate primarily in our Swiss home market, where we are organized into 10 regions, covering distinct Swiss 
economic areas. We operate a multi-channel approach, and we are constantly developing our digital and remote 
channels.
In Personal Banking, our main competitors are the cantonal banks, Raiffeisen, PostFinance and other regional and local 
Swiss banks; we also face competition from international neobanks and other national digital market participants. Areas 
of competition are basic banking services, mortgages and foreign exchange, as well as investment mandates and funds.
In the corporate and institutional business, the cantonal banks and globally active foreign banks are our main competitors. 
We compete in basic banking services, cash management, trade and export finance, asset servicing, investment advice 
for institutional clients, corporate finance and lending, and cash and securities transactions for banks. We also support 
the international business activities of our Swiss corporate clients through local hubs in New York, Frankfurt, Singapore 
and the Hong Kong SAR in competition with globally active foreign banks. No other Swiss bank offers its corporate clients 
local banking capabilities abroad.

Asset Management
Asset Management is a global, large-scale and diversified asset manager. We offer investment capabilities and styles 
across all major traditional and alternative asset classes, as well as advisory support to institutions, wholesale 
intermediaries and our Global Wealth Management clients.
Our strategy is focused on capitalizing on the areas where we have a leading position and differentiated capabilities 
(including alternatives, sustainability, indexed customization, separately managed accounts (SMAs) and key markets in 
Asia Pacific) in order to further drive profitable growth, while building on our strong business division partnerships across 
the Group.
Organizational changes
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group 
Following UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in 2023, we are now one of the leading Europe-based asset 
managers, with total invested assets of USD 1.6trn. The combination of our highly complementary businesses strengthens 
our positioning across key asset classes and growth markets, with greater scale in customized indexing, an enhanced 
offering in alternative investments (including a leading credit franchise) and an increased presence in the US and Asia.
We are bringing our two organizations operationally together, with a clear goal to provide our clients with the full breadth 
of our combined offering while ensuring a seamless transition and exceptional service.
Other organizational changes 
In October 2023, we completed the sale of our 51% stake in UBS Hana Asset Management Co., Ltd. to Hana Securities, 
after that firm exercised its buyout option. Hana Securities now owns 100% of UBS Hana Asset Management Co., Ltd. 
In addition, we completed the acquisition of the 40% minority interest in our real estate joint venture with Aventicum 
and now own 100% of the business. In December 2023, we announced the sale of our Brazilian real estate fund 
management business to Patria Investments; the transaction is subject to the approval of the investors in the relevant 
funds and customary anti-trust approvals. We also transferred the management of our three funds in Mexico to Catena 
Activos Alternativos and, with this sale, exited the asset management business in this market. 
How we do business 
We offer clients a wide range of investment products and services across all major traditional and alternative asset classes, 
in the form of segregated, pooled or advisory mandates, as well as registered investment funds in various jurisdictions. 
Our capabilities include equities, fixed income, hedge funds (single- and multi-manager), real estate and private markets, 
and indexed and alternative beta strategies, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as sustainable- and impactinvesting products and solutions. 
We also draw on the breadth of our capabilities to offer asset allocation and currency investment strategies across the 
risk–return spectrum, customized multi-asset solutions, and advisory and fiduciary services.
We continue to develop our award-winning1
 Indexed business globally, with a focus on customization, and provide client 
solutions across equities, fixed income and commodities, as well as sustainability-focused products. Our offering also 
includes a wide range of ETFs in Europe, Switzerland and Asia. 
In our Real Estate & Private Markets business, we continue to build on our global scale, leading core capabilities and 
highly differentiated sustainable-investing and specialized-thematic offering, including our Cold Storage, Energy Storage 
and Life Sciences strategies. We also continue to expand our leading multi-manager capabilities across real estate, 
infrastructure and private equity, including the development of new products to meet the growing demand from wealth 
management clients. 
Sustainable and impact investing remain key areas of interest for our clients. In 2023, we further expanded our offering 
across asset classes and themes, including new net-zero ambition products. We launched our first sustainability-focused 
fund of hedge funds strategy, created in close collaboration with Global Wealth Management. We also partnered again 
with Aon to launch the UBS Global Emerging Markets Equity Climate Transition Fund, which tilts toward emerging market 
companies supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy, while factoring in important social considerations. 
Stewardship is a fundamental element of our sustainability strategy. In 2023, we sharpened our five-year climate 
engagement program’s focus and also aligned our voting policy to our evolved climate engagement objectives. In 
addition, to support our increasing focus on natural capital, we became a founding member of the Nature Action 100 
collaborative engagement initiative and joined the Principles for Responsible Investment’s Stewardship Advisory 
Committee for its initiative on nature.

We also continue to build on our joint efforts with the other business divisions, enabling our teams to draw on the best 
ideas, solutions and capabilities from across the firm in order to deliver high-quality investment performance and 
experiences for our clients. For example, in 2023 we continued to expand our separately managed accounts (SMA) 
offering as part of our joint initiative with Global Wealth Management in the US. In support of this initiative, we launched 
the SMA Hub, a new self-service portal that enables financial advisors to generate custom client reports or proposals in 
only minutes.
Geographically, we are building on our extensive and long-standing presence in the Asia Pacific region, including China, 
where we continue to capitalize on our on- and offshore products and market presence, including our joint ventures.
To support our growth, we are focused on disciplined execution of our operational excellence initiatives. This includes 
further automation, simplification, process optimization and offshoring or nearshoring of selected activities, 
complemented by continued enhancements to our platform and development of our analytics and data capabilities. One 
example is our Portfolio Engineering & Trading initiative, which will streamline trading and portfolio implementation 
across our active and index capabilities through an integrated technology architecture. It will harmonize processes and 
enable further scalability of customization across asset classes.
Our operations and our competitors
Our business division is organized into five areas: Client Coverage; Investments; Real Estate & Private Markets; Products; 
and the COO area. We cover the main asset management markets globally, and have a local presence in 25 locations 
across four regions: the Americas; Asia Pacific; EMEA; and Switzerland. We have nine main hubs: Chicago; the Hong 
Kong SAR; London; New York; Shanghai; Singapore; Sydney; Tokyo; and Zurich.

Investment Bank
The Investment Bank provides services to institutional, corporate and wealth management clients, helping them raise 
capital, invest and manage risks, while targeting attractive and sustainable risk-adjusted returns for shareholders. Our 
traditional strengths are in equities, foreign exchange, research, advisory services and capital markets, complemented by 
a focused rates and credit platform. We use our data-driven research and technology capabilities to help clients adapt to 
evolving market structures and changes in regulatory, technological, economic and competitive landscapes.
Aiming to deliver market-leading solutions by using our intellectual capital and electronic platforms, we work closely with 
Global Wealth Management, Personal & Corporate Banking and Asset Management to bring the best of the Group’s 
capabilities to our clients. We do so with a disciplined approach to balance sheet deployment and costs.
Our priority is providing high-quality execution and seamless client service, through an integrated, solutions-led approach, 
with disciplined growth in the advisory and execution businesses, while accelerating our digital transformation. In Global 
Banking, we position ourselves as trusted advisors via our client coverage and ability to provide access to the wider suite 
of UBS’s capabilities. In Global Markets, we enable clients to buy, sell and finance securities on capital markets worldwide 
and to manage their risks and liquidity.
Organizational changes
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group represented an acceleration of the Investment Bank’s existing growth strategy, 
reinforcing and strengthening our coverage and presenting a powerful opportunity to enhance capabilities and client 
relevance in key products and regions.
An ambitious integration timeline for the Investment Bank has been set, and significant progress has been made with 
the creation of the newly established Non-core and Legacy division, which has started the process of divesting assets. 
We are working at pace to migrate clients and positions to the UBS platform and have concluded our workforce plans 
for the combined Investment Bank.
The Credit Suisse franchise helps us to build a more sustainable market share in a range of products and markets. It will 
enhance our capabilities, core products and services and enable us to deliver these products and services to an expanded 
institutional and corporate client base. The Investment Bank will be better positioned to serve Global Wealth 
Management, offering differentiated investment banking capabilities, and further enhance the connectivity with ultra 
high net worth and Global Family & Institutional Wealth clients. 
The combination is expected to drive changes in our future revenue footprint. Our increased scale will enhance our 
competitive positioning within each region and product set and rebalance our footprint. The Investment Bank has 
historically been strong in both equities and in the Asia Pacific region, while having a smaller footprint across fixed 
income, global banking, and the Americas. The integration of the Investment Bank (Credit Suisse) strengthens our 
presence in the Americas, particularly in global banking, and represents an acceleration of our growth strategy in the 
region. 
In Global Markets, we see the potential to gain market share in cash equities. We will also aim to capture market share 
in global equity derivatives, with a specific focus on flow derivatives, quantitative investment strategies and corporate 
derivatives.
In Switzerland and EMEA, the combination will reinforce our strong position in our domestic market. Meanwhile, in Asia 
Pacific, there is a complementarity between UBS’s strength in China and Australia and Credit Suisse’s broader capabilities 
across Southeast Asia.
Other organizational changes
In June 2023, Michael Ebert joined the Investment Bank Management Forum as Head of Credit Suisse for the Investment 
Bank, as well as Head of Americas for the Investment Bank. In August 2023, Marco Valla joined the Investment Bank 
Management Forum as Co-Head of Global Banking.
In October 2023, we launched our Strategic Insights and Advisory team in Global Banking, our content and advisory 
offering that brings together the expertise of the UBS Strategic Insights group and the Credit Suisse Corporate Insights 
group.
In December 2023, we announced the formation of our Executive Client Group, which is aimed at advising our clients at 
the C-suite level on strategic matters and is intended to drive a broad array of transactions to enhance the impact of our 
Global Banking coverage teams.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Our businesses 29
How we do business
Our business division consists of two areas: Global Banking and Global Markets, which are supported by Investment Bank 
Research. Our global coverage model utilizes our international industry expertise and product capabilities to meet clients’ 
emerging needs.
Our Global Banking business advises clients on strategic business opportunities, such as mergers, acquisitions and related 
strategic matters, and helps them raise capital, in both public and private markets, to fund their activities.
Our Global Markets business enables clients to buy, sell and finance securities on capital markets worldwide and to 
manage their risks and liquidity. We distribute, trade, finance and clear cash equities and equity-linked products, as well 
as structuring, originating and distributing new equity and equity-linked issues. From origination and distribution to 
managing risk and providing liquidity in foreign exchange, rates, credit and precious metals, we help clients to realize 
their financial goals. We provide flexible, innovative and bespoke access to solutions, from market and insight tools to 
trading strategies and execution.
Our Investment Bank Research business continues to publish research based on primary data to concentrate on datadriven outcomes and offers clients differentiated content about major financial markets and securities around the globe, 
with analysts based in more than 20 countries and with coverage of more than 3,400 stocks in 49 different countries1
. 
The Strategic Insights team provides timely and relevant information and insights to help clients quickly make decisions 
regarding their most important questions.
We seek to develop new products and solutions consistent with our capital-efficient business model, typically related to 
new technologies or changing market standards.
The Investment Bank offers our clients global advice and access to the world’s primary, secondary and private capital 
markets, including through an extensive array of sustainability-focused advice, products, research and events. The 
Investment Bank is focused on meeting clients’ needs, including those with respect to environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) considerations and sustainable finance, helping to reshape business models and investment 
opportunities and to develop sustainable finance products and solutions. 
In Global Markets, we develop products and solutions designed to meet clients’ specific and increasingly detailed ESG 
objectives. In carbon emissions solutions, our clients continued to access solutions that are linked to the recently launched 
UBS Constant Maturity Commodity Index emissions index, as well as those that are available via our execution and 
clearing capabilities for carbon emissions futures. We continued to scale the number of portfolio certificates linked to a 
range of sustainability and climate investment themes, despite challenging market conditions throughout 2023.
UBS is a founding member of Carbonplace, a marketplace platform that seeks to build infrastructure to scale voluntary 
carbon markets, with the aim of enabling firms such as UBS to offer clients the ability to buy, sell, hold and retire voluntary 
carbon credits. 
In Global Banking, ESG is a core component of many corporate business strategies and a key tool in achieving 
sustainability in business and corporate operating models. As pressure from regulators and other key stakeholder groups, 
such as customers, investors and employees, is increasing, so is the need for transformation. The ESG Advisory group 
provides the necessary lens helping UBS’s clients assess ESG topics throughout the corporate life cycle.
UBS arranged USD 53.7bn in green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked themed (GSSS) bonds through 102 
deals during 2023.1
 We also solidified our market position in the Swiss franc-denominated market with a combined 
market share of nearly 50%.1 We have also built a strong position in the ESG-labelled local debt market in Brazil.
Our independent ESG research team collaborates with UBS sector analysts and UBS Evidence Lab primary research 
experts, providing data-driven insights into ESG-relevant questions. The ESG research team works to identify touchpoints 
between markets, society and the environment, and to respond to ESG issues as they move to the center of investors’ 
agendas. UBS sector lead analysts authored a variety of our flagship ESG Sector Radar reports, as well as a broad range 
of ESG Company Radar reports.
Our ESG Company Radar research reports, which we launched in 2022, assess the impact of ESG factors at company 
level, and we continued to see a very positive client response to those reports. Other types of ESG content include 
thematic and cross-sectoral collaborations, ESG Keys (which covers sustainable investing topics), and an increasing 
number of regional perspectives from our expanded ESG team, which works out of our offices in New York, London, the 
Hong Kong SAR, Tokyo and Sydney.

Our digital strategy harnesses technology to provide access to sources of unique, global liquidity, personalized advice and 
differentiated content. The Investment Bank strives to be the digital investment bank of the future, focused on delivering 
innovation-led solutions, and efficiencies for our clients. As the world around us changes, our digital capabilities aim to 
harness emerging technologies and create new products and solutions, which enable our clients to adapt to evolving 
market structures and achieve their investment goals. 
Our ambition to be the most client-focused, efficient and data-driven investment bank is being realized through the 
simplification of technology architecture, increased speed and quality of delivery and the attraction of best-in-class talent. 
As we look forward to the continued evolution of our digital capabilities, we will see increased adoption of technologies, 
such as generative artificial intelligence, the consistent re-use of platforms and products, and the continued drive to make 
progress in our overall strategic imperatives, with regard to a new, combined Investment Bank.
Joint efforts between the Investment Bank and the other business divisions (for example, our work with Global Wealth 
Management on our new Global Family & Institutional Wealth coverage) and, externally, strategic partnerships (for 
example, UBS BB jointly with Banco do Brasil, focused on Latin America) continue to be key strategic priorities. 
Partnerships with Global Wealth Management and Asset Management enable us to provide clients with broad access to 
financing, global capital markets and portfolio solutions. We expect these initiatives to continue to lead to growth by 
delivering global products to each region, leveraging our global connectivity across borders and sharing and 
strengthening our best client relationships.
Our operations and our competitors
Our two business areas, Global Banking and Global Markets, are organized globally by product. Our business is regionally 
diversified, with a presence in more than 30 countries. We cover the main investment banking markets globally, and 
have major financial hubs across four regions: the Americas; Asia Pacific; EMEA; and Switzerland. 
Our global reach gives attractive options for growth. In the Americas, the largest investment banking fee pool globally, 
we continue to focus on increasing market share in our core Global Banking and Global Markets businesses. In Asia 
Pacific, opportunities arise mainly from expected market internationalization and growth in China, where we plan to 
grow by strengthening our presence, both onshore and offshore. In EMEA, we plan to leverage our strong base and 
brand recognition even further.
Competing firms operate in many of our markets, but our strategy differentiates us, with our focus on leadership in the 
areas where we have chosen to compete and a business model that leverages talent and technology rather than balance 
sheet. Our main competitors are the major global investment banks (e.g., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs) and 
corporate investment banks (e.g., Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan 
Chase). We also compete with boutique investment banks and fintech firms in certain regions and products.

Non-core and Legacy
In 2023, we created Non-core and Legacy, which includes positions and businesses not aligned with our strategy and 
policies. Those consist of the assets and liabilities reported as part of the former Capital Release Unit (Credit Suisse) and 
certain assets and liabilities of the former Investment Bank (Credit Suisse), Wealth Management (Credit Suisse), Swiss 
Bank (Credit Suisse) and Asset Management (Credit Suisse) divisions, as well as of the former Corporate Center (Credit 
Suisse). Non-core and Legacy also includes the remaining assets and liabilities of UBS’s Non-core and Legacy Portfolio, 
previously reported in Group Functions (now renamed to Group Items), and smaller amounts of assets and liabilities of 
UBS’s business divisions that we have assessed as not strategic in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
At the end of the second quarter of 2023, the positions included in Non-core and Legacy represented USD 83.8bn of 
risk-weighted assets (RWA) and USD 208.7bn of leverage ratio denominator (LRD). Since then, Non-core and Legacy has 
made significant progress against its capital reduction goals by reducing RWA by USD 11.8bn, or 14%, to USD 72.0bn 
and reducing the LRD by USD 71.6bn, or 34%, to USD 137.1bn, by the end of 2023.
Our key priorities and operations
We are actively reducing the assets of Non-core and Legacy in order to reduce operating costs and financial resource 
consumption, and to enable us to simplify infrastructure. Incremental costs or losses may arise in connection with the 
reduction of such assets and liabilities.
Our key priorities are as follows.
– Reduce RWA and LRD, freeing up capital for the UBS Group. We aim to achieve a share of around 5% of Group RWA 
by the end of 2026. Non-core and Legacy will continue to actively pursue acceleration of the natural roll-off through 
active unwinds when economically accretive.
– Reduce operating costs and financial resource consumption by simplifying and decommissioning infrastructure, 
accelerate integration where accretive, and minimize the size of the legal entity footprint. 
– Protect the client franchise by partnering with colleagues across the business divisions. 
Non-core and Legacy includes assets, operating expenses and funding costs related to the following Credit Suisse 
businesses: loans primarily related to corporate bank and emerging markets, the residual securitized products businesses, 
the macro trading business including rates and foreign exchange, the legacy life-finance business, the equities portfolio, 
including the remaining prime services businesses, electronic trading, equity swaps, share back-lending positions, legacy 
structured renewables-linked positions and the residual credit business. Non-core and Legacy also includes residual trades 
from businesses exited by the pre-integration UBS Investment Bank, mainly in 2012. The portfolio additionally 
encompasses positions relating to legal matters arising from businesses transferred to it at the time of its formation.
Group functions
Our Group functions are support and control functions that provide services to the Group, focusing on effectiveness, risk 
mitigation and efficiency. 
How we are organized
Our Group functions include the following major areas: Group Services (which consists of the Group Operations and 
Technology Office, Corporate Services, Compliance, Regulatory & Governance, Finance, Risk Control, Human Resources, 
Communications & Branding, Legal, the Group Integration Office, Group Sustainability and Impact, and Chief Strategy 
Office) and Group Treasury. 
Group Services
The vast majority of the support and control functions are fully aligned or shared among the business divisions, where they 
have full management responsibility. By keeping the activities of the businesses and support and control functions closely 
aligned, we improve efficiency and create a working environment built on accountability and collaboration. Virtually all costs 
incurred by the support and control functions are allocated to the business divisions, leaving a residual amount that we refer 
to as Group Items in our segment reporting in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. Certain activities are retained 
centrally, where not directly related to the businesses, such as group hedging and own debt activities in Group Treasury and 
certain other costs that are mainly related to deferred tax assets and costs relating to our legal entity transformation program.
Group Treasury
Group Treasury manages balance sheet structural risk (e.g., interest rate, structural foreign exchange and collateral 
risks), as well as the risks associated with our liquidity, capital and funding portfolios. Group Treasury serves all five 
business divisions, and its risk management is integrated into the Group risk governance framework. 
Organizational changes
As a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, Corporate Center (Credit Suisse), including Treasury, has become 
a part of Group Items. In addition, the former Non-core and Legacy Portfolio unit was transferred to the new Non-core 
and Legacy business division.

Global economic developments in 20231
The global economy was resilient in 2023, in spite of the steep interest rate rises by major central banks designed to curb 
inflation from the multi-decade highs reached in 2022.
Global growth slowed only slightly, to 3.2%, in 2023, down from 3.4% in 2022. This partly reflected the strength of the 
US economy, where growth withstood higher interest rates, tightening bank lending standards, and mediocre real 
income growth. US GDP growth increased to 2.5% in 2023, up from 1.9% in 2022, as job security and relatively strong 
balance sheets encouraged higher spending by middle-income consumers. Economies in Europe also expanded in 2023, 
though at a slower pace. Growth in the Eurozone slowed to 0.5% in 2023, down from 3.4% in 2022, as the European 
Central Bank (the ECB) repeatedly raised interest rates. Growth in the Swiss economy slowed to 0.7% in 2023, down 
from 2.7% in 2022. UK GDP growth slowed to 0.1% in 2023, down from 4.3% in 2022, as high inflation and interest 
rate rises also limited growth. 
Growth in China increased to 5.2% in 2023, compared with 3% in 2022, when its economy was slowed by pandemic 
restrictions that were in place until late in that year. However, cautious spending by domestic consumers meant that the 
rebound in growth was weaker than had been expected. Growth in India remained robust at 7% in 2023, down only 
slightly from 7.2% in 2022. 
Inflation eased across developed economies, especially in the second half of 2023, as supply chains continued to recover 
from COVID-19 disruptions, energy prices were lower than 2022 and central bank interest rate rises increased the cost 
of borrowing. US consumer price inflation slowed to an annual 3.4% in December 2023, from 6.4% in January 2023. 
Inflation decelerated even more markedly in the Eurozone, to 2.9% year over year in December 2023, compared with 
8.5% in January 2023. This trend enabled the Federal Reserve and the ECB to signal late in 2023 that monetary tightening 
had probably come to an end.
The MSCI All Country World Index returned a 22.2% gain in 2023, with close to half of that gain coming in the final two 
months of the year. The S&P 500 rose by 26.3%, lifted by optimism that innovations in artificial intelligence will boost 
profits and hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut rates swiftly in response to falling inflation. The FANG+ index, which 
tracks the 10 most traded US tech stocks, increased 96% over the year. The MSCI Japan was the best-performing major 
market in local currency terms in 2023, with a return of 28.6%, its highest in a decade. In Europe, the MSCI EMU returned 
18.8%. Although the Swiss and UK markets lagged behind global stocks, both ended the year in positive territory, with 
returns of 5.3% and 7.7%, respectively. The weakest performance by a major market came from the MSCI China, which 
lost 10.7% amid disappointment over the pace of the economic recovery from pandemic restrictions and more limitedthan-expected stimulus. 
Economic and market outlook for 20241
Our baseline scenario for 2024 is for a soft landing in the US and subdued but positive growth in the Eurozone. We 
expect growth in China to enter a new normal of lower, but potentially higher-quality, growth. 
We believe inflation will continue falling toward central bank targets, and, as a result, we believe policymakers will feel 
confident enough to lower interest rates starting around the middle of 2024. We expect cuts from the Federal Reserve, 
the ECB, the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of England. In contrast, with Japanese deflation coming to an end, we 
expect the Bank of Japan to raise rates into positive territory for the first time since late 2015. 
With regard to growth, we expect the US to slow to a sustainable long-term rate of growth, due to declining housing 
affordability and the withdrawal of some government support measures that helped households during the COVID-19 
pandemic. However, middle-income consumers still appear to have spending power, as well as relatively strong balance 
sheets, and we expect demand for labor to remain resilient. Overall, we expect US GDP growth to remain positive, at 
around 1.1% in 2024. We expect growth to be weak in the Eurozone, at 0.6%, due to the lagged effect of higher 
interest rates. We also expect UK GDP to increase by 0.6% in 2024, while GDP growth in Switzerland is expected to 
increase to 1.2% in 2024. 
Geopolitical events and elections also have the potential to play an outsized role in 2024. The US presidential election, 
the ongoing Israel–Hamas and Russia–Ukraine wars, and the tension between the US and China could all affect markets 
globally. In addition, more than four billion people in more than 40 countries are set to go to the polls in 2024, including 
in the US, India and, potentially, the UK.

Industry trends
Although our industry has been significantly affected by various regulatory developments in the past decade, 
technological transformation and changing client expectations are further emerging as key drivers of change today, 
increasingly affecting the competitive landscape, as well as our products, service models and operations. In parallel, our 
industry continues to be materially driven by changes in financial markets and macroeconomic and geopolitical 
conditions.
Digitalization
Digitalization continues to accelerate in our industry. Clients demand a seamless and personalized technology experience 
that involves both innovative and sustainable solutions. The rising rate of digital adoption can be seen across all regional, 
demographic and client segments. The ascent of artificial intelligence (AI) has created an opportunity to significantly 
improve both employee efficiency and client service. Financial institutions are finding ways to accelerate the adoption of 
AI in a risk- and regulatory-compliant manner and with ethical considerations in place. As a result, the shift from 
digitalizing and automating existing processes to digital-as-default solutions is well underway, while also taking into 
consideration human interaction, a component that continues to be an important competitive factor.
Keeping pace with emerging technologies is key; themes such as generative AI have progressed significantly and are 
expected to continue growing at pace. Generative AI offers the potential to democratize the use of AI well beyond data 
scientists, broadening the scope for its application and its associated benefits. As the technology evolves, so does the 
associated risk landscape, but the focus remains on safeguarding our clients and their data, with the evolution of AI 
governance as an area of strategic importance.
Digital communication, with clients and employees alike, has established new remote ways of working, enabling financial 
services providers to attract an even wider array of talent than before. The digitalization of the financial services sector 
has led to a structural shift in the workforce: more and better engineers are required to keep banks at the forefront of 
technology.
Continuous investment in technology is driving automation and simplification of labor-intensive processes, improving 
banks’ operational efficiency, and freeing up resources to focus on client needs. Decision-making is becoming increasingly 
data-driven, with advanced analytics and AI enabling banks to address client needs in an even more targeted manner. In 
a consistently connected, open, and location-independent financial services ecosystem, the focus lies on adopting opensource technology, including cloud-native and modular architecture, to drive innovation and open exchange.
An open-finance environment combined with a shift in business models from in-person to digital channels bears the risk 
of increased digital vulnerability. Clients and other stakeholders expect ethical, responsible and secure data management 
practices. This makes the protection of the firm’s data and the optimization of its cybersecurity capabilities a continued 
priority and focus.
Distributed ledger technology applications, including digital cash solutions, are gradually being adopted by the banking 
industry. Decentralized finance solutions are expected to mature over the coming years and may reshape our industry. 
They provide opportunities to overcome friction within the existing financial system, increase banking efficiency, broaden 
access to underserved communities and make previously unviable products or services available to the financial services 
sector. They also further enable early-stage concepts, such as Web 3.0 and the metaverse, which could lead to an 
enhanced digital user experience.
Sustainability
The continued decarbonization of the global economy will require governments, regulators, all industries and consumers 
to move in the same direction. A series of recent legislative acts, including the rollout of the Inflation Reduction Act in 
the US and the EU’s Green Deal Industrial Plan, along with rising regulatory requirements, encourage investment into 
sustainable solutions, including infrastructure.
Meanwhile, policymakers and regulators increasingly require corporations to embed and disclose environmental, social 
and governance considerations. For example, the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which came into 
force in 2023, is intended to provide greater transparency and reliability of information to investors.
During 2023, flows into sustainable funds remained modestly positive, while traditional funds faced outflows impacted 
by the equity and bond market volatility and worsening geopolitical tensions.1
 Throughout the year investors also 
expanded their sustainable investment allocations into alternative asset classes, including hedge funds, real estate and 
infrastructure. Following the subdued issuances in 2022, green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked (GSSS) bond 
supply rebounded in 2023. 
Our view is that the long-term growth trajectory for sustainable finance plays to our strengths, as we continue to build 
on our offering and develop the innovative products and solutions that our institutional and private clients need both to 
manage the risks and capture the opportunities presented by the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Client expectations
As technology progresses, clients more rapidly redefine the way they live, work and interact with others. This is reshaping 
clients’ expectations toward financial services firms, as their reference points are increasingly influenced by experiences 
with companies outside the sector, where technology-supported and data-driven solutions are progressively enabling a 
more personalized, relevant, on-time and seamless client experience. These services often focus on convenience, 
flexibility, transparency and personalization, and drive toward holistically addressing clients’ needs and facilitating 
community building. Therefore, our industry needs to evolve, as clients measure us against new standards. 
While the industry’s overall focus still remains on digital-led solutions, recent geopolitical, macroeconomic and societal 
shifts have highlighted values such as security, trust, stability and a credible plan toward a sustainable future, leading to 
an increased demand in investment, financing and advisory products and services that fit clients’ own sustainability 
preferences and ambitions.
Consolidation
Many regions and businesses in the financial services sector are still highly fragmented. We expect further consolidation, 
with the key drivers being ongoing margin pressure, capital constraints (e.g., due to pressure on asset prices in a higherinterest-rate environment), a push for cost efficiencies and increasing scale advantages resulting from fixed technology 
costs and regulatory requirements. Many stakeholders in the financial services sector continue to seek increasing exposure 
and access to regions with attractive growth profiles, such as Asia and other emerging markets, through local acquisitions 
or partnerships, as well as acquiring new capabilities addressing changes in market dynamics and overall client demands. 
The increased focus on core capabilities and geographical footprint, as well as the ongoing simplification of business 
models to reduce operational and compliance risks, is likely to drive further disposals of non-core businesses and assets. 
While banks already face increasing challenges from digitalization needs and intensified competition, potential tightening 
in macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions across major economies may create further pressure.
New competitors
Our competitive environment is evolving. In addition to traditional competitors in the asset-gathering businesses, new 
entrants are targeting selected parts of the value chain. We have recently observed a growing supply of private credit 
from private debt funds, facilitating an industry shift in lending volumes for high-yield lending products. However, we 
have not yet seen a fundamental unbundling of the value chain and client relationships, which might ultimately result in 
the further disintermediation of banks by new competitors. Over the long term, we believe large platform companies 
entering the financial services sector could pose a larger competitive threat, given their strong client franchises and access 
to client data, if they decide to broaden the scope of their services. While fintech firms continue to gain momentum, 
recent macroeconomic developments have slowed this trend, as funding appetite and valuations have trended 
downward. Although we expect the industry to recover in the future, we do not expect a material disruption to our assetgathering businesses. As fintech firms mature, their success will inevitably depend on their ability to navigate our 
regulatory landscape, build customer trust and maintain innovation. The trend for forging partnerships between new 
entrants and incumbent banks will therefore continue, as technology and innovation help banks overcome new 
challenges.
Wealth development2
General overview of wealth development2
As of the end of 2022, global financial wealth is estimated at USD 255trn and is expected to continue to grow. After 
more than a decade of steady expansion, the growth of global financial wealth slowed for the first time in 2022, 
decreasing to USD 255trn, a 3.5% decrease compared with 2021. The decrease was mainly driven by various 
macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. However, this decrease is expected to be temporary, and wealth development 
is projected to continue in an upward trajectory in the coming years. 
Challenges such as persistent inflation, the resulting rise in interest rates (which contributed to lower equity market 
performance) and a weaker-than-expected recovery in China, as well as geopolitical tensions and armed conflicts, 
persisted throughout 2023. However, global financial wealth is expected to continue growing at an average of 5% per 
year until 2027.
Almost half of the world’s financial wealth was concentrated in the Americas (48%), followed by Asia Pacific (28%), 
Europe (21%) and the Middle East and Africa (3%). 
Looking at our invested assets, almost half of those were concentrated in the Americas (49%), while the remaining half 
was almost equally distributed between Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East and Africa (approximately 17% per 
region). 
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Our environment 35
Wealth segment view3
At the beginning of 2023, wealth was still highly concentrated. Approximately one-third of global high net worth 
individual (HNWI) wealth was controlled by 1% of the HNWI population (those with wealth in excess of USD 30m). 
Around a quarter of global HNWI wealth was held by 9% of the HNWI population (those with wealth ranging from 
USD 5m to USD 30m), while the remainder of the HNWI wealth was held by 90% of the HNWI population, i.e., those 
with wealth between USD 1m and USD 5m.
Specifically, when looking at the billionaire wealth segment, wealth recovered from its post-pandemic fall, growing by 
9% in nominal terms, while the billionaire population rose by 7% globally.4
Wealth transfer5
Between 2020 and 2030, more than USD 18trn of collective wealth is expected to be transferred globally by individuals 
with USD 5m or more in net worth to their next-in-line heirs or spouses.6
 North America and Europe are the regions with 
the largest expected wealth transfers, with the US alone responsible for approximately 60% of all transfers. 
When looking at the billionaire wealth segment, based on the findings of UBS’s latest Billionaire Ambitions Report, for 
the first time in 10 years new billionaires in the 12 months to April 2023 accumulated more wealth through inheritance 
than entrepreneurship. This is expected to increase during the next 20 to 30 years, as more than 1,000 billionaires pass 
an estimated USD 5.2trn to their heirs. This is of great significance, as this new generation of billionaires has fresh views 
about business, investments and philanthropy. Many are redirecting the large pools of private wealth they control to new 
business opportunities, and possibly away from their families’ businesses.4
While this wealth transfer poses a challenge for wealth managers to retain current assets, it also creates opportunities to 
capture new assets from competitors, as well as to start building relationships with the next generation and to cater to 
their evolving needs. UBS provides clients with tailored services and solutions depending on client profiles and 
jurisdictions, while facilitating succession planning, a highly significant and challenging topic for many clients.7
Female investors 
Today, women are creating wealth faster than ever before and doing so at a faster pace than men, due to factors such 
as shifting global wealth distribution, cultural attitudes, intergenerational wealth transfers and a rise in businesses owned 
by women. This trend will likely gain further momentum in the years to come. In 2022, 12% of all billionaires worldwide 
were women, worth a total of USD 1.56trn, an increase of 2% compared with the prior year.3
 To address this segment, 
UBS has created a dedicated approach tailored to female investors, adapting its offering to the specific needs of each 
client. UBS was recently highly commended in the Best Private Bank for Wealthy Women category at the PWM / The 
Banker 2023 awards.
Entrepreneurs 
With an expected compounded annual growth rate of 6% between 2020 and 2025, entrepreneurs represent the largest 
and fastest-growing contributors to the global wealth management revenue pool and are expected to account for almost 
one-third of total wealth management revenues by 2025.8
We are addressing the opportunities entrepreneurs present by leveraging our global footprint and capabilities to address 
their evolving needs at every stage of the business life cycle. Additionally, we have created the Industry Leader Network, 
an exclusive peer-to-peer entrepreneur network that offers opportunities for connecting through content-rich events, 
through a dedicated digital platform and through regular information exchanges.
Long-term investment trends resilient in the face of market uncertainty
2023 saw turbulence in the global financial markets, as a combination of varying expectations about the level of interest 
rates, inflation, and geopolitical tensions caused equity and fixed income performance to fluctuate several times across 
the course of the year. There was increased investor appetite for fixed income, accompanied by outflows from equity 
funds. 
Inflation has decreased across most major markets globally, and while hopes of a softer landing have risen, inflation 
remains above target, including in the US. This continues to be a challenge across Europe, given continued low growth. 
In our view, despite the uncertainty, the opportunity has significantly improved for investors looking to build diversified, 
risk-aware portfolios, and the long-term trend toward shifts into illiquid alternatives that can deliver compelling longerterm, risk-adjusted returns and into low-cost, efficient passive strategies across liquid markets has not changed. The 
breadth of our investment expertise and capabilities enables us to find the right solutions for clients as the environment 
evolves.

How we create value for our stakeholders
Clients
Our clients are the heart of our business. We are committed to building and sustaining long-term relationships based on 
mutual respect, trust and integrity. Understanding our clients’ needs and expectations enables us to best serve their 
interests and to create value for them.
A combined firm with expanded reach and capabilities for clients
With the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in 2023, our client offering, expertise and geographical reach have 
expanded significantly. 
The wealth management businesses of UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG have largely complementary footprints across 
locations and client segments, that support one of the core pillars of our client value proposition in Global Wealth 
Management: the ability to serve clients regardless of where they are and what they need. Following the acquisition, all 
of our Global Wealth Management clients now have access to the UBS House View by our Chief Investment Office. We 
are continuing to align our wealth management product and solution offerings, helping clients to grow, protect and 
transfer their wealth.
We are the leading bank In Switzerland, leveraging the strength of the newly combined Swiss business to broaden our 
services and to promote innovation to our clients. The legal merger of two entities, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG and UBS 
Switzerland AG, is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2024, with the Swiss Bank (Credit Suisse) division 
being integrated into Personal & Corporate Banking. We are taking on the integration with the utmost care and intend 
to spend the time needed to achieve the best possible outcome for our clients, our employees and the Swiss financial 
center.
Following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, we are bringing together our highly complementary asset 
management businesses and enhancing the value that we provide to clients through expanded capabilities across key 
asset classes and growth markets. This includes greater scale in customized indexing, an enhanced offering in alternatives 
including a leading credit franchise, and an increased presence in the US and Asia.
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group strengthens the Investment Bank’s coverage. It deepens our capabilities in 
core products and services, enabling us to deliver services to a broader institutional- and corporate-client base, while 
bringing us critical mass in key markets. The Investment Bank will also be better positioned to serve Global Wealth 
Management clients, offering differentiated investment banking capabilities and further enhancing connectivity with 
ultra high net worth and Global Family & Institutional Wealth clients. 
Engaging with our clients
Our clients’ needs and their preferred communication channels continually evolve. Our objective is to engage with clients 
in the ways most convenient for them. We use a variety of channels to engage with clients, including regular client 
relationship and service meetings, as well as various corporate roadshows and dedicated events, and we have established 
a mix of hybrid and in-person events.
Global Wealth Management interacted with clients via various settings in 2023, from personalized private briefings with 
subject matter experts to segment-specific virtual and in-person events and large-scale initiatives. We utilize marketing 
campaigns, events, advertising, publications and digital-only solutions to help drive greater awareness of UBS among 
prospective clients and reinforce trust-based relationships between advisors and clients. We proactively engaged with 
clients to reassure them about the acquisition and highlighted the benefits of the combined organization. This was done 
through individual meetings and calls, and, as the acquisition progressed, we were able to open up some of our flagship 
events and conferences to clients of the combined firm.
Personal & Corporate Banking holds regular client events (leveraging a number of formats, such as webcasts and inperson, virtual or hybrid events), covering a wide range of topics. In 2023, we enhanced our digital engagement strategies 
to reach more clients and strengthen relationships with existing ones. We utilize various channels, including social media, 
online displays, and search engines.
In Asset Management, we had a consistent program of client events and engagement activities throughout 2023. These 
included our flagship conferences, such as the annual UBS Reserve Management Seminar, and we held our first global 
in-person outlook roadshow in multiple locations across the world. Alongside this, our teams continued the high level of 
interaction with clients globally, supported by digital tools and our publication of macro insights. We also hosted a broad 
range of hybrid events, including our investment series, to help our clients better understand market challenges and 
opportunities, and we continued to engage with clients through our social media and online channels.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | How we create value for our stakeholders 37
The Investment Bank hosted more than 180 investor conferences and educational seminars globally in 2023, covering a 
broad range of macro, sector, regional and regulatory topics. Almost all of those conferences were held virtually. We 
leverage our intellectual capital and relationships and use our execution capabilities, differentiated research content, 
bespoke solutions, client franchise model and global platform to expand coverage across a broad set of clients. UBS Neo 
Question Bank is the largest global database of market-related questions asked by professional investors, and UBS Live 
Desk, built within the UBS Neo platform, provides clients with a stream of fast-paced commentary from UBS traders. The 
UBS Analytical Research Community (UBS-ARC) is a proprietary, interconnected research network of industry leaders, 
subject matter specialists, executives, academics and analysts in the Americas region.
How we measure client satisfaction
We continue to use multiple techniques to regularly assess our achievements and the satisfaction of our clients. Global 
Wealth Management is increasingly using technology and analytics capabilities to collect and respond to client feedback. 
Personal & Corporate Banking1
 has conducted annual surveys of clients in Switzerland since 2008, consistently covering 
most private and corporate-client segments annually since 2015. In Asset Management, we have an integrated process 
to record and manage client feedback through our client relationship management tool, and we also conduct regular 
surveys. The Investment Bank closely monitors client satisfaction via individual product coverage points. Direct client 
feedback is actively captured and tracked in our systems. The Investment Bank also closely monitors external surveys, 
which provide feedback across a range of investment banking services.

Investors
We aim to create sustainable, long-term value for our investors by executing our strategy, growth and integration plans 
while maintaining risk and cost discipline, and delivering attractive shareholder returns through the cycle.
Investor base
Our investor base is well diversified. A substantial proportion of our institutional shareholders are based in the US, the 
UK and Switzerland.
› Refer to the “Corporate governance” section of this report for more information about disclosed shareholdings
Alignment of interests
We aim to align the interests of our employees with those of our equity and debt investors, and this approach is reflected 
in our compensation philosophy and practices.
› Refer to “Our compensation philosophy” in the “Compensation” section of this report for more information
We are focused on driving sustainable long-term growth while maintaining risk and cost discipline
Our objective is generating value for all of our stakeholders by driving sustainable growth across the cycle. In the short 
term, our main priorities are the integration of Credit Suisse, positioning the firm for efficient long-term growth by rightsizing the cost base, optimizing the balance sheet and investing strategically in order to achieve our long-term growth 
ambitions. By the end of 2026 and beyond, this will enable us to deliver significant value for all our stakeholders and 
remain a reliable economic partner, employer and taxpayer in the communities where we operate. Moreover, we are 
aiming to maximize our impact and that of our clients to create long-term sustainable value.
Our primary measurement of the Group’s financial performance is return on common equity tier 1 (CET1), as regulatory 
capital is our binding constraint and drives our ability to return capital to shareholders.
› Refer to the “Targets, capital guidance and ambitions” section of this report for more information
› Refer to “Our focus on sustainability and climate” in this section for more information about our environmental, social and 
governance aspirations
Balancing resilience, growth and attractive capital returns
Capital strength is a key pillar of our strategy, and we are committed to maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons. This 
includes our strong capitalization, in line with our capital guidance of maintaining a CET1 capital ratio of around 14% 
and a CET1 leverage ratio of greater than 4.0%.
We are committed to investing for sustainable growth. Our balance sheet provides ample capacity for return-accretive, 
sustainable growth. We plan to fund this growth organically from the capital released from the unwinding of the Noncore and Legacy business division, as well as capital optimization measures in our core divisions.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | How we create value for our stakeholders 38
We intend to distribute excess capital to shareholders, in the form of a progressive dividend and share buybacks. For the 
2023 financial year, the Board of Directors plans to propose a dividend to UBS Group AG shareholders of USD 0.70 per 
share, a 27% increase year on year. We remain committed to progressive dividends and are accruing for a mid-teen 
percentage increase in the dividend per share for the 2024 financial year. We are committed to distributing excess capital 
to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and plan to reinstate share repurchases of up to USD 1bn during 2024, 
commencing after the completion of the merger between UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG, which is expected by the end 
of the second quarter of 2024. It is our ambition for share repurchases in 2026 to exceed the 2022 levels of USD 5.6bn.

Communications
Our Investor Relations (IR) function is the primary point of contact between UBS and our shareholders. Our senior 
management and IR regularly interact with institutional investors, financial analysts and other market participants, such 
as credit rating agencies. Clear, transparent and relevant disclosures, and regular direct interactions with existing and 
prospective shareholders, form the basis for our communications. The IR team relays the views of and feedback on UBS 
from institutional investors and other market participants to our senior management.
IR and our Corporate Responsibility function work together and interact with investors interested in sustainability topics 
relevant to UBS and wider society.

Employees
We are dedicated to being a world-class employer and a place where people can unlock their full potential. Our 
employees execute our business strategy and deliver the products and services our clients need. We therefore continued 
to invest in measures to strengthen our culture in 2023 and to provide a framework for employee growth and well-being 
within our overarching people management approach.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | How we create value for our stakeholders 39
The three keys and our corporate culture
Our culture, which is the foundation of our identity, is based on our three keys to success: our Pillars, Principles and 
Behaviors. Together, these keys drive our business decisions and our people management processes. Generally speaking, 
the employee cultures of UBS and Credit Suisse are based on similar foundations: integrity, collaboration and high levels 
of engagement are the norm for both organizations. In the second half of 2023, familiarizing our new colleagues with 
our three keys principles and building a unified culture across our combined organization were top priorities. A culture 
integration forum was established to oversee and support the cultural integration efforts across the combined firm. 
Employee integration progressed throughout 2023, starting with senior leadership decisions and continuing down to 
individual teams, seeking to bring talented individuals together in a fair, consistent and meritocratic approach. Those 
efforts, and the employee engagement and development initiatives that support the integration, will continue, and even 
increase, in 2024.
Culture-building behavior is promoted through a number of Group-wide, divisional and regional initiatives. One example 
is Three Keys on Air. In 2023, this Group-wide series of webcast employee events highlighted key aspects of our culture, 
including maximizing performance, psychological safety in high-performing teams and excellence in risk management. 
In addition, the Group Franchise Awards (GFA) program recognizes employees for cross-divisional collaboration and for 
suggesting innovative or simplification ideas. In 2023, more than 1,800 ideas were submitted for consideration. The 
global peer-to-peer appreciation program (called Kudos) makes it easy for employees to recognize and appreciate their 
colleagues’ above-and-beyond behavior. This serves to promote excellence and increase engagement and employee 
satisfaction. In 2023, our employees gave nearly 439,000 Kudos recognitions. Credit Suisse employees participated in 
Recognizing and Valuing Excellence (RAVE), a similar peer-to-peer recognition program. The GFA program and Kudos 
will be rolled out to the entire organization starting in 2024.

Hiring, developing and retaining talent
We hired a total of 11,435 external candidates across the combined firm in 2023 and developed more than 3,700 
graduates and other trainees, apprentices and interns around the globe. We actively promote multi-year apprenticeship 
programs in Switzerland and the UK, along with summer internship programs in the US, EMEA, Asia Pacific and 
Switzerland. 
In 2023, most employees were eligible to work partially from home, depending on their role, regulatory restrictions and 
location, as well as divisional or functional requirements. Already similar, the hybrid-working programs of the UBS subgroup and the Credit Suisse sub-group will be aligned over the course of the integration. These measures, along with 
options such as part-time working, job sharing and partial retirement, help us attract and retain diverse top talent.

Talent management and development
We want our employees to be able to build long and successful careers. Our systematic approach to talent management 
includes annual talent and succession reviews that help ensure we have strong talent pipelines and succession plans. 
Group-wide talent programs are offered across the organization and supplemented by specific programs in the business 
divisions, business areas or functions and regions. Programs range from those targeting senior leaders to those targeting 
junior talent, in addition to those open to women and employees from diverse backgrounds. 
Internal mobility is a key component of our approach, with line managers expected to support individual development 
and mobility. In 2023, 38.8% of all open roles at our firm were filled by internal candidates. Employees can explore career 
paths, search for jobs and short-term rotations, and connect with mentors on our Career Navigator platform. Credit 
Suisse employees are expected to have full access during 2024.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | How we create value for our stakeholders 40
All internal training is delivered via our UBS University platform. Our offering includes client advisor certification and 
regulatory, business, and line manager training, alongside modules on topics such as sustainable finance, data literacy, 
and well-being. Credit Suisse employees transitioned onto the UBS University platform in January 2024. Across the 
combined firm in 2023, employees completed more than 2.3 million learning activities (including mandatory training) for 
an average of 1.91 training days per employee. Together with Credit Suisse we invested more than USD 100m in training 
activities in 2023.
Performance management 
Our performance management approach (MyImpact) reflects our strategy and supports our high-performance culture. 
We consider both performance and behavior-related objectives because we value what an employee accomplishes and 
how our Behaviors (accountability with integrity, collaboration and innovation) are demonstrated. Regular check-ins, 
along with an embedded feedback app, enable employees to give and receive ongoing feedback, supporting continuous 
improvement.
Credit Suisse employees were fully integrated into this performance management approach before the start of year-end 
reviews, and the same process was applied across the entire organization. Active involvement from managers and matrix 
managers, along with feedback from across the combined organization, ensured a consistent and fair performance 
review approach.
Fair and equitable pay 
Fair and consistent pay practices are designed to ensure employees are appropriately rewarded for their contribution. We 
pay for performance, and we take pay equity seriously. We have embedded clear commitments in our global 
compensation policies and practices. We regularly conduct internal reviews and independent external audits on pay 
equity, and our statistical analyses show a differential between men and women in similar roles across our major locations 
of less than 1%. Beginning in 2020, UBS was certified (through 2023) by the EQUAL-SALARY Foundation for our human 
resources (HR) practices, including compensation, in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, 
covering more than two-thirds of our global employee population.
All of our HR policies are global, and we apply the same standards across all locations. Furthermore, we review our 
approach and policies annually to support our continuous improvement. We also aim to ensure that all employees are 
paid at least a living wage.1
 We regularly assess employees’ salaries against local living wages, using benchmarks defined 
by the Fair Wage Network. In 2023, all employees’ salaries were at or above the respective benchmarks.
› Refer to the “Compensation” section of this report for more information
Diversity, equity and inclusion
Our employee diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) strategy is built on four pillars: how we hold ourselves accountable, 
how we hire, how we develop talent and how we build a culture of belonging. We leverage all four pillars as we move 
toward achieving our ambitious gender and ethnic diversity aspirations and creating an inclusive culture for all.
In 2020, we outlined specific intentions to increase our female and ethnic minority representation, especially among 
management. We aspire to have by 2025 30% of Director level and above roles globally held by women and 26% of 
Director level and above roles in the US and the UK held by ethnic minority talent, along with additional regional 
aspirations. Our DE&I aspirations remain unchanged for the combined organization and the Credit Suisse DE&I aspirations 
have been retired. 
As of the end of 2023, women accounted for 40.9% of our workforce and 29.5% of our Director level and above 
population, up from 27.8% in 2022 and 26.7% in 2021.2
 Women also held 30.5% of management positions, of which 
22.6% were in revenue-generating functions. Furthermore, 37.5% of members of the Group Executive Board (the GEB) 
and 33.3% of members of the Board of Directors (the BoD) were women, as were 30.3% of senior managers who 
reported directly to a member of the GEB.
Due to variations in legal requirements and other factors, we take a country-specific approach to increasing 
representation of ethnic minorities and place particular focus on making progress in the UK and the US. As of the end of 
2023, employees from ethnic minority backgrounds held 24.3% of Director level and above roles in the UK, up from 
23.4% in 2022 and 21.9% in 2021. In the same year, employees from ethnic minority backgrounds held 25.1% of 
Director level and above roles in the US, up from 20.5% in 2022 and 20.1% in 2021.
Our 64 employee networks are vital to building a sense of belonging and strengthening our inclusive culture. The Credit 
Suisse sub-group and the UBS sub-group employee networks were integrated by the end of 2023, enabling us to combine 
programming and resources, and to extend our networks’ impact to a much larger audience.
We build connections with colleagues and clients with disabilities through our association with The Valuable 500, a global 
collective of companies actively supporting disability inclusion. Initiatives in 2023 included training for employees and HR 
specialists, sponsoring disability-focused employee networks and groups, and further increasing physical and digital 
accessibility for employees and clients alike.

Employee engagement and support
We regularly conduct employee life-cycle surveys, analyses of specific business issues and short “pulse” surveys to learn 
about employees’ views and concerns. One such pulse survey, conducted across the combined organization in November 
2023, found that 87% of respondents reported experiencing a professional and respectful work environment, and 83% 
reported that their function collaborates well with different areas. Furthermore, 77% of respondents felt empowered to 
make decisions and 86% felt able to speak up and raise concerns.3
 All of these results are above the financial services 
benchmark.4
We are committed to being a responsible employer, and that includes supporting our employees’ overall health and wellbeing. Social, physical, mental and financial well-being elements are woven into our HR policies and practices, as well as 
into initiatives to increase awareness and educate employees. In early 2023, UBS became a founding partner of 
#WorkingWithCancer to better support employees who are impacted by cancer. During the second half of the year, we 
provided information and support to help employees adapt to changes related to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse 
Group.

Society
With a clear focus on people, planet and partnerships, Social Impact has continued to be a strong differentiator for the 
firm, with our activities underpinning our sustainability strategy. With our acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group and the 
ongoing integration, we will continue to put clients and people first across the combined organization and help clients 
maximize their impact locally and globally. Credit Suisse’s long-standing commitment to society and philanthropic support 
to communities complements and strengthens our global impact footprint.
Our vision is to contribute to and scale an impact economy, an economy that values the well-being of all people and the 
planet. This means building partnerships that drive greater impact transparency, more impact ventures and innovative 
ways of financing and paying for impact.
Philanthropy services and collective impact
We believe that by working collectively, philanthropists and public and private organizations have the potential to create 
lasting change and maximize a positive impact for people and planet. We provide comprehensive advice, insights and 
execution services, working with our clients and finding ways to tackle some of the world’s most pressing social and 
environmental problems. We aim to mobilize USD 1bn in philanthropic capital and positively impact more than 
26.5 million people by 2025 (cumulative total since 2021).
Collective impact
The power of philanthropic partnerships will be critical in achieving systemic scalable change. We have three Collectives, 
where philanthropists, led by our in-house philanthropy team, are working together, bringing together their efforts, skills 
and resources during a two-year learning journey. By combining our expertise and investor capital, our aim is to fund 
initiatives that address (i) child protection, (ii) climate change and (iii) health- and education-related issues. Each Collective 
provides investors with an opportunity to work alongside peers and expert practitioners to achieve systemic change.
Helping our clients structure their philanthropy: donor-advised funds
Donor-advised funds offer clients an alternative charitable-giving vehicle to set up their own foundations, offering greater 
choice and personalization, and are managed in line with their usual investment approach. Their charitable donations 
can be invested within the parameters they select (such as capital, growth or income), helping them to grow their fund 
to give grants at a later date. Administration fees are borne by UBS. UBS offers these services in Switzerland, Singapore 
and the UK, and in 2023 they were launched in the Hong Kong SAR, with USD 318m in donations in 2023.1
UBS Global Visionaries
Through our UBS Global Visionaries program, we aim to (i) create opportunities for clients and prospective clients to 
connect with leading social entrepreneurs and (ii) help the best entrepreneurs focusing on social and environmental issues 
to scale their positive change by expanding their network, building capacity and raising awareness about their work. 
Since the program started in 2016, we have onboarded and supported 85 entrepreneurs to accelerate their impact.

The UBS Optimus network of foundations
The UBS Optimus network of foundations also aims to contribute to an impact economy that meets the long-term needs 
of children and preserves the natural environment. It connects clients with programs that are making a measurable, longterm difference to the most serious and enduring social and environmental problems. It has been operating for 24 years 
now and it is focused on incubating impact ventures, scaling impact through partnerships and achieving impact 
transparency. In 2023, the UBS Optimus network of foundations had a presence in nine global locations. It is now working 
on harmonizing the Credit Suisse program portfolio. This effort includes Credit Suisse’s four corporate foundations 
supporting the Americas, EMEA, Asia Pacific and Switzerland. 
In 2023, the UBS Optimus network of foundations raised USD 328m in donations, including UBS matching contributions, 
and committed USD 306m in grants from the foundations.1
Highlights in 2023
Social and blended finance
The UBS Optimus network of foundations is actively developing larger-scale investment vehicles, in partnership with other 
parts of UBS, by using a blended finance approach. In 2023, it secured major investor commitments for a USD 100m 
SDG Outcomes blended finance initiative with Bridges Outcomes Partnerships, British International Investment (the UK’s 
development finance institution) and the US International Development Finance Corporation. These anchor investors 
participated alongside private investors, including Legatum, family offices (such as the Tsao Family Office) and other high 
net worth individuals. 
Emergency philanthropy
The UBS Optimus network of foundations and UBS Social Impact teams raise funds and support partners providing 
emergency relief in response to disaster situations, and we sometimes launch dedicated appeals to support these efforts. 
In 2023, the UBS Optimus network of foundations raised and started to distribute more than USD 25m for the Turkey 
and Syria earthquake, the Hawaiian wildfires, flooding in Pakistan and Italy, and people affected by the humanitarian 
crisis in Israel and Gaza. The UBS Optimus network of foundations also continued to distribute the USD 56m raised for 
the Ukraine Relief Fund launched in 2022. To date, USD 43m has been granted to our partners on the ground.
UBS’s charitable contributions
Communities
We aim to maximize our impact in local communities. We recognize that our long-term success depends on the health 
and prosperity of the communities that we are part of. We have a strategic focus on education and the development of 
skills, as we believe these topics are where our resources can make the most impact. We regard our long-term investment 
in these areas as central to furthering the economic and social inclusion of people that our activities support.
Our direct cash contributions (including through partnerships in the communities that we operate in) and UBS’s affiliated 
foundations in Switzerland, as well as contributions to the UBS Optimus network of foundations, amounted to USD 63m 
in 2023.
› Refer to “Charitable contributions” in the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available under “Annual 
reporting” at ubs.com/investors, for an overview of UBS’s charitable contributions in 2023
Employee volunteering
Our well-established employee volunteering model has been adapted to meet the needs of our new hybrid ways of 
working, with both face-to-face and virtual opportunities to support our local communities. We have global targets for 
employee engagement through volunteering, which are built bottom-up and on a best-efforts basis. In 2023, we 
successfully engaged 38% of our global workforce in volunteering, and 45% of the 199,633 volunteer hours were skillsbased.2
Volunteering not only has a positive impact on our NGO partners and the populations they serve, it also contributes to 
corporate culture and creates a sense of belonging. UBS and Credit Suisse regional employee volunteering teams started 
to offer joint assignments in July 2023 to support team-building efforts across the firm.
1 Figures provided for the UBS Optimus network of foundations and donor-advised funds are based on unaudited management accounts and information available as of January 2024. Audited financial statements for 
the UBS Optimus network of foundations and donor-advised foundation entities are produced and available per local market regulatory guidelines.

Our focus on sustainability and climate
At UBS, we are committed to working toward the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (the SDGs) and the 
orderly transition to a low-carbon economy, as well as assisting our clients to do so. Finance has an important role to 
play as companies and individuals consider how best to approach the transition to a more sustainable global economy. 
As the world shifts to a low-carbon economy, the regulatory environment continues to evolve, as do the associated 
capital-raising and investment opportunities.
Our Code of Conduct and Ethics
In our Code of Conduct and Ethics (the Code), the Board of Directors (the BoD) and the Group Executive Board (the GEB) 
set out the principles and practices that define our ethical standards, and the way we do business, which apply to all 
aspects of our business. All employees must affirm annually that they have read and will adhere to the Code and other 
key policies, supporting a culture where ethical and responsible behavior is part of our everyday operations. In our Code, 
we make a commitment to acting with the long term in mind and creating value for clients, employees, communities 
and investors. We aspire to play our part in creating a fairer and more prosperous society, championing a healthier 
environment and addressing inequalities. This ethos is in line with our external commitments, such as our pledge to help 
make progress toward the SDGs. Following a substantial revision of the Code in 2021, we made further adjustments in 
our 2022 and 2023 reviews of it, mainly focused on clarifying, simplifying and aligning language used.

Our sustainability and impact governance
Sustainability activities, including climate, are overseen at the highest level of UBS, by the BoD and the GEB, and are 
grounded in our Code.
› Refer to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available under “Annual reporting” at ubs.com/investors, for more 
information about sustainability activities 
The BoD is responsible for setting UBS’s values and standards for the purpose of ensuring that the Group’s obligations 
to shareholders and other stakeholders are met. The Chairman of the BoD, together with the Group CEO, takes 
responsibility for UBS’s reputation and is closely involved in and responsible for ensuring effective communication with 
shareholders and other stakeholders, including government officials, regulators and public organizations. All BoD 
committees have specific responsibilities pertaining to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. For example, 
the Compensation Committee is responsible for ESG-related compensation topics, the Risk Committee supervises the 
integration of ESG in risk management, the Governance and Nominating Committee supports the Board in establishing 
best practices in corporate governance and the Audit Committee has oversight of the control framework underpinning 
ESG metrics. 
The Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee (the CCRC) of the BoD is the body primarily responsible for 
corporate culture, responsibility and sustainability. The CCRC oversees our Group-wide sustainability and impact strategy 
and key activities across environmental and social topics. This includes climate, nature and human rights. Annually, it 
considers and approves our sustainability and impact objectives. Each year, the CCRC considers and approves our 
sustainability and impact objectives. The CCRC’s function is forward looking, in that it monitors and reviews societal 
trends and transformational developments and assesses their potential relevance for the Group. In undertaking this 
assessment, it reviews stakeholder concerns and expectations pertaining to the societal performance of UBS and to the 
development of UBS’s corporate culture. The CCRC is also responsible for conducting the annual review process for the 
Code and for proposing amendments to the BoD. This review process includes a prior review of the Code by the GEB 
and is led by the Group CEO. 
The Group CEO has delegated responsibility for setting the sustainability and impact strategy and developing Groupwide sustainability and impact objectives, in agreement with fellow GEB members, to the GEB Lead for Sustainability and 
Impact, Beatriz Martin Jimenez. On behalf of the GEB, the GEB Lead for Sustainability and Impact proposes the strategy 
and objectives to the CCRC. Progress against strategy and the associated targets are reviewed at least once a year by the 
GEB and the CCRC. The GEB Lead for Sustainability and Impact also manages the Group Sustainability and Impact (GSI) 
organization and, together with our Chief Sustainability Officer (the CSO), co-chairs our Sustainability and Climate Task 
Force (the SCTF), which oversees the implementation of the Group’s sustainability activities and its climate action plan, 
including its net-zero program. Senior representatives from across our firm, including from the business divisions, Risk, 
Compliance and Finance, attend the SCTF’s regular meetings. Both the GEB Lead for Sustainability and Impact and the 
CSO attend the meetings of the CCRC.
The GEB also resolves overarching matters relating to sustainability and climate risks, including risk management 
framework, policies, and disclosure.

Group Sustainability and Impact
The GSI organization consists of the Chief Sustainability Office and the Social Impact Office, headed by the CSO and the 
Head Social Impact, respectively. The CSO is responsible for driving the implementation of the Group-wide sustainability 
and impact strategy, net-zero strategy across all in-scope activities, and the ESG data strategy. In addition, the CSO has 
responsibility for supporting the business divisions and Group Items in the design of sustainability frameworks, 
implementation of sustainability regulations and development of training on sustainability. The CSO also manages 
external relationships, industry advocacy and the annual sustainability disclosure.
The Head Social Impact is responsible for driving and implementing the social impact strategy, including Community 
Impact, Philanthropy Services and UBS Global Visionaries. Reporting to the Head Social Impact, the regional Heads of 
Social Impact and Philanthropy are responsible for extending the reach of and maximizing the impact of our social impact 
activities locally, nationally and globally. In addition, they have responsibility for all our programs’ operations and risk 
management, client engagement, and employee volunteering.
Progress made in implementing Group-wide sustainability and impact objectives is reported as part of UBS’s annual 
sustainability disclosure. UBS is certified against the ISO 14001 standard for its products, services and activities in all 
business divisions and locations. To this extent, UBS seeks to continuously improve environmental and sustainability 
performance, as well as pollution prevention across UBS. The GSI governance and framework document complements 
the Code, and together they govern UBS’s environmental management system, according to ISO 14001.

Our sustainability and impact strategy
To help us maximize our impact, we focus on three key areas to drive the sustainability transition: planet, people and 
partnerships.
– Planet: We acknowledge that achieving the orderly transition to a low-carbon economy is highly ambitious. 
Nonetheless, we are committed to doing our part, which is why the shift to a lower-carbon future is a priority for UBS 
and a key focus of our sustainability strategy.
– People: We believe in a diverse, equitable and inclusive society. We are taking action to get there, within our own 
workplace and beyond.
– Partnerships: By working in partnership with other thought leaders and standard setters, our goal is to help change 
on a global scale.

Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | How we create value for our stakeholders 46
We understand the deep interrelationships that exist between climate and nature. Our approach to climate, including 
our ambition to achieve net zero, also forms part of our approach toward managing nature-related risks and 
opportunities.

Our approach to sustainable finance
We are committed to supporting our clients’ sustainability ambitions, whether they focus on reducing the carbon 
emissions footprint of their business or portfolios or seek to encourage a more equitable and more prosperous society.

Defining sustainable finance
It is important to set out how we define sustainable finance, as no uniformly accepted definition currently exists in the 
industry. We consider sustainable finance to include any financial product or service (including both investing and 
financing solutions) that aims to explicitly align with and / or contribute to sustainability-related objectives, while targeting 
market-rate risk-adjusted financial returns. Sustainability-related objectives may include, but are not limited to, the SDGs 
identified in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
Our approach to sustainable finance is also reflected in the Group sustainable investing framework, which specifically 
defines “sustainability focus” and “impact investing” products.
Both categories reflect a defined and explicit sustainability intention of the underlying investment strategy. This 
intentionality differentiates them from traditional investment products or those that consider sustainability-related aspects 
but do not actively and explicitly pursue any specific sustainability objective, such as ESG integration or exclusions-only 
approaches.
Our sustainable finance ambitions 
Through our sustainable finance product and service offerings, we target four key objectives in serving our clients. 
– The power of choice: we want to give our investing clients the choices they need to meet their specific sustainability 
objectives. 
– An orderly transition: we aim to support our clients in their transition to a low-carbon economy, for instance by offering 
innovative sustainable financing and investment solutions.
– Managing risks and identifying opportunities: we offer research and thematic insights, as well as data and analytics 
services. Combined with targeted advice, these are designed to help clients better understand and mitigate risks and 
identify new opportunities.
– Making sustainable finance an everyday topic: we want to make sustainability topics tangible throughout our 
interactions with clients. To help us do that, we provide support in the form of tools, platforms and education.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | How we create value for our stakeholders 47
Sustainable finance
We continued to support the sustainability ambitions of our corporate and institutional clients via our financing solutions. 
We helped facilitate USD 53.7bn of green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bond deals, such as structuring 
and support of Western Australia Treasury Corporation’s inaugural AUD 1.9bn green bond. We introduced sustainabilitylinked loans for multi-national corporations and further supported our clients with ESG advisory services and tools, such 
as the renovation and subsidies calculators for clients in Switzerland.
Sustainable investing
Similarly to the overall markets, our sustainable investing (SI) invested assets continued to grow in 2023. We continued 
to expand the SI product offering for our clients, including, among others, new net-zero ambition portfolios, sustainable 
hedge funds and private-market impact solutions, as well as low-carbon investing modules.

1 The table above details UBS AG Sustainable Investing Invested Assets (IA) and the evolution thereof. This table does not contain any Credit Suisse products and associated IA classified under the Credit Suisse 
Sustainable Investing Framework (SIF). Credit Suisse IA in accordance with the SIF are reported separately as figures are not directly comparable with the UBS figures due to material differences in the underlying 
sustainable investment frameworks and definitions being applied. Refer to “Appendix 3 – Entity-specific disclosures for Credit Suisse AG” in the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available under “Annual 
reporting” at ubs.com/investors, for more information. 2 We focus our sustainable investment reporting on those investment strategies exhibiting an explicit sustainability intention. 3 Strategies that have explicit 
sustainable intentions or objectives that drive the strategy. Underlying investments may contribute to positive sustainability outcomes through products / services / use of proceeds. 4 Strategies that have explicit 
intentions of generating measurable, verifiable and positive sustainability outcomes. Impact generated is attributable to investor action and/or contributions. 5 Certain products have been reclassified during 2023 
for reasons including, but not limited to, an evolving regulatory environment, periodic monitoring of the product shelf, and developing internal classification standards. Impact of these movements on sustainable 
investment invested assets was a net reduction by USD 7bn in UBS AG Global Wealth Management Americas and a net reduction by USD 6bn in UBS AG Asset Management. 6 In line with general market practice, 
IA reported for sustainable investments include limited amounts of instruments not classified as sustainable investment, including cash and cash-like instruments that each fund and portfolio hold for liquidity 
management purposes, as well as, subject to clear, limiting restrictions, client-directed investments included in sustainable investing mandates managed by UBS Asset Management. 7 The impact investing and total 
sustainable investments (UBS AG) disclosures for 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 reporting periods have been restated to remove investments that were duplicated in the disclosed values. As a result, the 
values disclosed for 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 for both categories have each decreased by USD 1.6bn and USD 0.4bn, respectively. 8 Total invested assets (UBS AG) are used to calculate the SI 
proportion.
This was also reflected in our clients’ continued interest in SI solutions. Over the course of 2023, UBS AG’s SI invested 
assets rose to USD 292.3bn as of 31 December2023, compared with USD 266bn at the end of 2022, representing a 
year-on-year increase of 10%. A combination of factors contributed to this growth, including new product launches, net 
new money inflows as well as market performance. SI invested assets accounted for 6.5% of UBS’s total invested assets 
at year-end2023.

Managing sustainability and climate risks
Helping to further the Group’s broader sustainability goals with due consideration to our responsibility to manage risk, 
we manage sustainability and climate risk under a pragmatic and robust policy. That policy incorporates our risk 
management framework and related standards and guidelines and applies to our own operations, our balance sheet, 
our clients’ assets and our supply chain.
Our approach to managing sustainability, climate and nature-related risk helps us identify and manage potential adverse 
impacts on the climate, on the environment and to human rights, as well as the associated risks affecting our clients and 
us. We define sustainability and climate risk as the risk that UBS negatively impacts, or is impacted by, climate change, 
natural capital, human rights, and other ESG matters. Sustainability and climate risks may manifest as credit, market, 
liquidity and / or non-financial risks for UBS, resulting in potential adverse financial, liability and / or reputational impacts. 
These risks extend to the value of investments and may also affect the value of collateral (e.g., real estate). Climate risks 
can arise from either changing climate conditions (physical risks) or from efforts to mitigate climate change (transition 
risks). Physical and transition risks from a changing climate contribute to a structural change across economies and, 
consequently, can affect banks and the financial sector through financial and non-financial impacts.

Our aspirations and progress
We work with a long-term focus on providing appropriate returns to our stakeholders in a responsible manner. We are 
committed to providing transparent aspirations or targets and reporting on the progress made against them. Following 
the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, our exposure increased accordingly, so we reviewed our aspirations. 
Amendments that arose from this review process were considered by the GEB and the CCRC. This table reflects the 
overall outcomes of this process with more detailed information provided in the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023.

1 As part of the integration of Credit Suisse, UBS has retired the pre-acquisition UBS sustainable investing aspiration of USD 400bn in SI invested assets. 2 While we continue to take steps to align our business 
activities to our targets, it is important to note that progress towards our targets may not be linear and that the realization of our own targets and aspirations is dependent on various factors which are outside of our 
direct influence. We will continue to adjust our approach in line with external developments and evolving best practices for the financial sector and climate science. Refer to the Supplement to the UBS Group 
Sustainability Report 2023, available under “Annual reporting” at ubs.com/investors, for more information about parts of the value chain within sectors covered by metrics and targets. Metrics are based on gross 
exposure, which includes total loans and advances to customers, fair value loans and guarantees, and irrevocable loan commitments. Exclusions from the scope of analysis primarily include financial services, credit 
card and other exposure to private individuals. 3 As part of our ship finance strategy, ships in scope of Poseidon Principles (PP) are assessed on criteria which aim at aligning portfolios to the PP decarbonization 
trajectories. The PP are a framework for assessing and disclosing, on an annual basis, the climate alignment of in-scope ship finance portfolios to the ambition of the International Maritime Organization (the IMO), 
including its 2023 Revised GHG Strategy for GHG emissions from international shipping to decrease to net zero by or around 2050 (compared with 2008 levels). 4 Refer to the “Environment” section of the UBS 
Group Sustainability Report 2023, available under “Annual reporting” at ubs.com/investors, for further information. The inherent one-year time lag between the as-of date of our lending exposure and the as-of date 
of emissions can be explained by two factors: corporations disclose their emissions in annual reporting only a few months after the end of a financial year; and specialized third-party data providers take up to nine 
months to collect disclosed data and make it available to data users. Consequently, the baselines for our decarbonization targets are calculated on year-end 2021 lending exposure and 2020 emissions data. Our 2022 
emissions actuals are based on year-end 2022 lending exposure and 2021 emissions data. For asset financing (e.g., real estate, shipping) there is no time lag, and exposure and emissions actuals refer to the same 
year. 5 The 20% alignment goal amounted to USD 235bn at the time of pre-acquisition Asset Management’s commitment in 2021. By 2030, the weighted average carbon intensity of funds is to be 50% below the 
carbon intensity of the respective 2019 benchmark. 6 Scope 2 emissions are market-based emissions. The remaining scope 1 and 2 emissions may be in excess of the approximately 5–10% residuals required for net 
zero (per the definition of a “net-zero target” by the ESRS E1 Climate Change per delegated act, adopted on 31 July 2023), which is our ambition for 2050. In 2024, we will be reviewing our 2025 scope 1 and 2 
target for achievability for the combined organization and alignment with latest guidance. 7 In 2024, we may review our targets for GHG key vendors for the combined organization and alignment with latest 
guidance. Our GHG key vendors are those vendors that collectively account for more than 50% of our estimated vendor GHG emissions. 8 Figures provided for the UBS Optimus network of foundations are based on 
unaudited management accounts and information available as of January 2024. Audited financial statements for UBS Optimus network of foundations entities are produced and available per local market regulatory 
guideline.
Cautionary note: We have developed methodologies that we use to set our climate-related targets and identify climate-related risks and which underly the metrics that are disclosed in this report. Standard-setting 
organizations and regulators continue to provide new or revised guidance and standards, as well as new or enhanced regulatory requirements for climate disclosures. Our disclosed metrics are based upon data available 
to us, including estimates and approximations where actual or specific data is not available. We intend to update our disclosures to comply with new guidance and regulatory requirements as they become applicable 
to UBS. Such updates may result in revisions to our disclosed metrics, our methodologies and related disclosures, which may be substantial, as well as changes to the metrics we disclose.

Reporting to our stakeholders on our sustainability strategy and activities
Further information about our sustainability efforts and commitments is provided in the UBS Group Sustainability Report 
2023, available under “Annual reporting” at ubs.com/investors. The content of the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023 
has been prepared in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, with the German rules implementing 
the EU Directive on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information (2014/95/EU) and the Swiss Code of Obligations 
(Art. 964a et. seq.). UBS is in the process of implementing a combined and aligned sustainability-and-climate-risk dataset 
across UBS Group and including Credit Suisse AG. For this reason, UBS will publish UBS Group and Credit Suisse AG 
sustainability and climate risk metrics required pursuant to FINMA Circular 2016/1 “Disclosure – banks”, Annex 5, in a 
supplement to the UBS Group Annual Report and the UBS Group Sustainability Report in line with the publication timeline 
for the semi-annual Pillar 3 disclosures in the third quarter of 2024. All climate- and nature-related information contained 
in the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023 is also made available through a separate UBS Group Climate and Nature 
Report 2023. The latter report follows the structure recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (the TCFD) and also leverages the framework of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (the 
TNFD). Our reporting on sustainability has been reviewed on a limited assurance basis by Ernst & Young Ltd against the 
GRI Standards.

Financial crime prevention
Combating money laundering and terrorist financing has been a major focus of many governments in recent years. Laws 
and regulations, including the Swiss Banking Act and the US Bank Secrecy Act, require effective policies, procedures and 
controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing, and the verification of client identities. 
Failure to introduce and maintain adequate programs to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing can result in 
significant legal and reputational risk and fines.

Recovery and resolution
Swiss TBTF legislation requires each Swiss SRB to establish an emergency plan to maintain systemic functions in case of 
impending insolvency. In response to these Swiss requirements and similar ones in other jurisdictions, UBS has developed 
recovery plans and resolution strategies, as well as plans for restructuring or winding down businesses if the firm could 
not otherwise be stabilized. 
In 2013, FINMA stated its preference for a single point of entry (an SPE) strategy for globally active SRBs, such as UBS, 
with a bail-in at the group holding company level. UBS has made structural, financial and operational changes to facilitate 
an SPE strategy and is confident that a resolution of the bank is operationally executable and legally enforceable. In 2023, 
UBS acquired the Credit Suisse Group and merged Credit Suisse Group AG into UBS Group AG. UBS Group AG subsumed 
all the capital and loss-absorbing instruments of Credit Suisse Group AG with the acquisition. A bail-in remains 
operationally executable for the combined UBS Group and an SPE resolution strategy remains the preferred strategy for 
UBS.
FINMA evaluates the recovery and resolution plans of Swiss SRBs on a regular basis. In its most recent assessment, which 
was published in April 2023 and based on year-end 2022 information, FINMA re-confirmed that UBS’s Swiss emergency 
plan is effective, that the recovery plan has been approved and that UBS fulfills all resolvability criteria. The same was 
confirmed for Credit Suisse. This assessment did not reflect the combined organization and the respective plans will need 
to be amended and approved for the new and combined Group. FINMA will review its resolvability assessment of the 
combined UBS Group as the integration progresses. A new, interim assessment is expected to be published by FINMA at 
the end of the second quarter of 2024.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Regulation and supervision 53
Crisis management framework
The UBS Group’s crisis management framework assigns responsibility and actions depending on the nature of the stress 
incident and the scale of the response needed.
– For incident, risk and crisis management, the Group Crisis Task Force works with incident management teams that 
provide monitoring and early-warning indicators at the local / regional level, without needing to activate protocols at 
the Group level. If a local response is insufficient, global task forces and crisis management teams provide decisionmaking guidance and coordination, including crisis management plans, protocols and playbooks, and contingency 
funding plans.
– The Group Executive Board (the GEB) and the Board of Directors (the BoD) would evaluate and decide upon the need 
to activate the Global Recovery Plan (the GRP) if a stress event reached a severity requiring activation based on the 
GRP’s recovery risk indicators.
– FINMA has the authority to determine whether the point of non-viability (the PONV), as defined by Swiss law, has 
been reached and, as part of the resolution plan, has the power to order the bail-in of creditors to recapitalize and 
stabilize the Group, limit payments of dividends and interest, alter our legal structure, take actions to reduce business 
risk, and order a restructuring of the bank.
Credit Suisse AG and its subsidiaries also maintain a separate crisis management framework, including processes, 
governance and responsibilities, which will be in place as long as those legal entities exist and are subject to standalone 
recovery and resolution requirements. The standards and processes applied have been harmonized with the UBS 
framework to the extent possible. 
Global Recovery Plan 
The GRP provides a tool to restore financial strength if UBS comes under severe capital or liquidity stress. Quantitative 
and qualitative triggers are monitored daily and are subject to predefined governance and escalation processes. Recovery 
options are linked to owners and checklists, with the objectives of preserving capital, raising capital or liquidity, or 
disposing of or winding down businesses.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Regulation and supervision 54
Global Resolution Strategy
FINMA is required to produce a global resolution plan for UBS. The plan includes setting out measures that FINMA can 
take to resolve UBS in an orderly manner if the Group enters resolution. The SPE bail-in strategy would involve writing 
down the Group’s remaining equity and additional tier 1 and tier 2 instruments, as well as the bailing in of the TLACeligible senior unsecured bonds at the UBS Group AG level. An internal recapitalization of undercapitalized subsidiaries 
would be executed simultaneously with losses transmitted to UBS AG or Credit Suisse AG, and, ultimately, UBS 
Group AG. Post-resolution restructuring measures could include disposals or wind-down of businesses and assets.
Local recovery and resolution plans
The Swiss emergency plans demonstrate how UBS’s systemically important functions and critical operations in Switzerland 
can continue if the UBS Group cannot be restructured. This is achieved mainly by operating the Swiss-booked business 
in separate legal entities and by maintaining sufficient capital and liquidity to ensure their continued operation. Until the 
merger of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG into UBS Switzerland AG, UBS will maintain two separate Swiss emergency plans 
to cater for differences in the organizational setup and differences in infrastructure. 
The US resolution plans set out the steps that could be taken to resolve the US intermediate holding companies (the US 
IHCs) i.e., UBS Americas Holding LLC and Credit Suisse Holdings (USA), Inc., and their subsidiaries if they suffered material 
financial distress and the UBS Group was unable or unwilling to provide financial support. As required by US regulations, 
our US plans contemplate that the US IHCs will commence US bankruptcy proceedings. Prior to this, the plans envisage 
the US IHCs downstreaming financial resources to their respective subsidiaries to facilitate an orderly wind-down or 
disposal of businesses. Following the expected integration of Credit Suisse Holdings (USA), Inc. into UBS Americas Holding 
LLC in 2024, only the resolution plan of UBS Americas Holding LLC will be maintained. 
UBS Europe SE updates a local recovery plan annually based on ECB requirements, and resolution planning information 
and capabilities based on Single Resolution Board requirements. On the basis of such information, the Internal Resolution 
Team, composed of members of the Single Resolution Board, produces a resolution plan for UBS Europe SE. In addition, 
several Credit Suisse subsidiaries in Europe will maintain local recovery plans until the Credit Suisse entities are integrated 
into the UBS intermediate parent undertaking.
UBS operates a UK banking subsidiary with Credit Suisse International, which is subject to the UK Resolvability Assessment 
Framework (the UK RAF). Under the UK RAF, Credit Suisse International is required to assess its recovery planning and 
resolvability planning capabilities against the standards defined in the UK RAF on an annual basis and confirm its 
compliance to the BoE and PRA.
Other local recovery and resolution plans exist for various Group entities and jurisdictions.
Regulatory trends
In 2023, regulatory policy was strongly impacted by the banking turmoil in March, with financial stability concerns 
returning to the forefront, followed by renewed discussions around the effectiveness of too-big-to-fail / resolution 
frameworks and subsequent initial lessons drawn being discussed throughout the year. While the reviews by 
supranational standard-setters and in Switzerland generally upheld the appropriateness of the international regulatory 
and resolution frameworks, certain themes requiring further attention were identified with additional analyses ongoing.
The digitalization of banking and corresponding policy responses continued throughout 2023, with attention paid to 
systemic risks, market integrity, investor protection and cross-border aspects related to digital assets. Initial policy efforts 
started on decentralized finance. In the meantime, most major central banks increased their engagement related to 
central bank digital currencies. New capabilities and wider adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) have resulted in increased 
regulatory focus on the topic, particularly regarding sound governance frameworks, safety and fairness. The large-scale 
use of both traditional and non-traditional data by AI models has given rise to questions around the adequacy of existing 
data legislation and in some jurisdictions will likely result in enhanced protections. Separately, many jurisdictions 
continued to make data more available across sectors, with a focus on open finance.
Sustainable finance and climate-related financial risks remained a key focus for policymakers in 2023, where we observed 
noteworthy activity in the areas of corporate and product disclosures for climate-related financial risks, specifically relating 
to banks’ governance, strategy, and risk management, as well as efforts to standardize and harmonize regulations across 
different jurisdictions. Policymakers advanced guidelines related to nature and biodiversity topics by intensifying the focus 
on disclosures, risk management, and quantification methodologies. Furthermore, we observed ongoing regulatory policy 
related to net-zero financing while transition planning started to become an important focus topic for policymakers. On 
the topic of products regulation, regulatory initiatives continued to focus on carbon and carbon markets and addressing 
issues related to greenwashing. Lastly, we saw increased regulatory attention paid to solutions related to social impact 
investing and blended finance.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Regulation and supervision 55
The national implementation of the Basel III requirements continued to be an important focus area. The authorities in 
Switzerland issued rules to implement the final standards into Swiss law, and US banking regulators launched a public 
consultation in 2023. Switzerland has confirmed the effective date for the revised rules as 1 January 2025. Although the 
EU is still targeting implementation by January 2025, the UK and the US have delayed the application until July 2025, 
with the US also including a three-year transition timeline. Differences in the implementation timelines and in the content 
of the provisions remain a challenge for globally active banks.
In addition, regulatory authorities continued to refine existing regulations, including efforts to strengthen the anti-moneylaundering guidelines on beneficial ownership and work on enhancing third-party risk management with operational 
resilience remaining a key issue. The focus on retail investor protection sharpened, in particular in asset management. In 
the US, retail investor protection features became a component of an ongoing broader equity market reform. In the UK, 
reviews of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime focused on determining whether the regime delivers against 
its original aim and how it can be improved. Finally, in light of increasing risks, non-bank financial intermediation 
remained a topic of concern with national and supranational policymakers.
We believe the continued adaptations made to our business model and our proactive management of regulatory change 
put us in a strong position to absorb upcoming changes to the regulatory environment. We trust that our strengthened 
position as a combined organization will allow us to cope with any potential challenges.

Regulatory and legal developments
Developments related to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group and the banking turmoil in March 2023
Key developments in Switzerland
Based on the emergency ordinance issued by the Swiss Federal Council in connection with the acquisition of the Credit 
Suisse Group on 16 March 2023, as amended on 19 March 2023, (the Emergency Ordinance), UBS Group AG entered 
into a loss protection agreement (an LPA) with the Swiss Confederation, with an effective date of 12 June 2023. As part 
of this agreement, the Swiss Confederation would have borne up to CHF 9bn of losses, if realized, on a designated 
portfolio of Credit Suisse’s non-core assets after the first CHF 5bn of losses, which would have been borne by UBS.
Under the Emergency Ordinance, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG also had access to additional liquidity assistance loans, 
the Emergency Liquidity Assistance Plus (ELA+) loans, provided by the Swiss National Bank (the SNB) of up to CHF 100bn 
on a combined basis, with the loans under the facility having preferential rights in bankruptcy proceedings. The Credit 
Suisse Group was also allowed to borrow up to an additional CHF 100bn from the SNB backed by a Swiss federal default 
guarantee, the Public Liquidity Backstop (the PLB), with the loans having preferential rights in bankruptcy proceedings.
On 11 August 2023, UBS Group AG voluntarily terminated the LPA and the PLB. After reviewing all assets covered by 
the LPA since the closing of the Transaction in June 2023 and taking the appropriate fair value adjustments, UBS 
concluded that the LPA was no longer required. All loans under the PLB were fully repaid by the Credit Suisse Group as 
of the end of May 2023 and Credit Suisse AG fully repaid the outstanding ELA+ loans on 10 August 2023. As of 
31 December 2023, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG had a total of CHF 38bn outstanding under the Emergency Liquidity 
Assistance facility, which is fully collateralized by Swiss mortgages.
In parallel with the measures taken by the Swiss Confederation in March 2023, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory 
Authority (FINMA) also ordered a write-off of CHF 15.8bn principal amount of Credit Suisse Group AG’s additional tier 1 
(AT1) instruments.
In May 2023, the Swiss Federal Department of Finance mandated a group of experts on banking stability to assess the 
role of banks and the legal and regulatory framework related to the stability of the Swiss financial center. The 
corresponding report, published in September 2023, concluded that Swiss capital regulations are working as intended 
and that there is no need for a major revision. However, the report sees a need for reforms with regard to banking 
supervision and proposes that the relevant authorities be granted broader powers. Furthermore, the report suggests 
improvements regarding liquidity regulations, including a proposal to extend the supply of liquidity in the case of a crisis. 
The report also suggests that Swiss authorities should make improvements with regard to crisis preparation and 
management. 
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Regulatory and legal developments 56
In June 2023, the Swiss Parliament formed a parliamentary inquiry committee that is mandated to investigate the 
legitimacy, expediency and effectiveness of the management of the competent authorities and bodies in the context of 
the events involving the Credit Suisse Group. The committee will report to the Swiss Parliament on the results of its 
investigation and will propose measures to remedy any identified deficiencies. We expect the results to be published in 
the fourth quarter of 2024. The conclusions by the inquiry committee may include potentially significant 
recommendations, which could result in more stringent regulation.
In December 2023, FINMA published a report on the case of Credit Suisse that analyzed the development of Credit Suisse 
in recent years and examined its supervisory work with the bank. In addition, FINMA noted in its report a number of 
lessons to be learned, calling for a stronger legal basis, specifically for instruments such as a Senior Managers Regime, 
the power to impose fines, and more stringent rules regarding corporate governance. Furthermore, FINMA explained 
that it will adapt its supervisory approach in certain areas and will step up its review of whether stabilization measures 
are ready to be implemented. 
The findings of the group of experts and the lessons drawn by FINMA include recommendations that could result in more 
stringent regulation, and will be considered by the Swiss Federal Council in its next report on systemically important 
banks, which is to be presented by April 2024.
Key developments in the US
In May 2023, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) released reports that 
covered the circumstances leading to the closing of certain banking organizations following the events in the banking 
market in March 2023. The reports noted shortcomings in the supervisory agencies’ execution of examination programs, 
including escalation of supervisory issues and staffing. They also raised concerns related to the regulatory framework, 
including the Federal Reserve’s Tailoring Rule and other topics, such as interest rate risk management. UBS expects these 
developments to impact the regulatory environment in the US, where UBS has significant operations.
In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement a special assessment to recover losses incurred by the 
Deposit Insurance Fund in connection with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March 2023. The 
assessment is based on the estimated uninsured deposits of each depository institution at the end of 2022. The 
assessment will be collected over an eight-quarter period that started in January 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2023, 
UBS Bank USA recorded a charge for the full amount of its estimated assessment of USD 60m.
Key developments at the supranational level
In October 2023, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) released a report on the causes of the 2023 
banking turmoil. The BCBS argues that while the distress of various banks in March 2023 reflected idiosyncratic factors, 
recurring themes can be grouped into three broad categories: bank risk-management practices and governance 
arrangements; strong and effective supervision; and robust regulatory standards. 
Also in October 2023, the Financial Stability Board (the FSB) identified in a review several areas related to the effective 
operationalization and implementation of the international resolution framework that merit further attention as part of 
future work, but concluded that recent events demonstrate the soundness of the framework.
No concrete changes to the Basel standards or the FSB framework are proposed at this stage, but the follow-up work is 
particularly focused on strengthening supervisory effectiveness, liquidity risk, interest rate risk in the banking book and 
the effectiveness of the resolution frameworks.
Developments regarding capital and liquidity adequacy and TBTF frameworks
Developments related to liquidity adequacy
In September 2023, the Swiss Federal Council adopted a dispatch and draft legislation on the introduction of a public 
liquidity backstop for systemically important banks (SIBs), which was initially implemented as part of the Emergency 
Ordinance. The proposed legislative changes aim to establish the public liquidity backstop as part of ordinary law in order 
to enable the Swiss government and the SNB to support an SIB domiciled in Switzerland with liquidity in the process of 
resolution, in line with other financial centers. The introduction of the public liquidity backstop is intended to increase 
the confidence of market participants in the ability of SIBs to be successfully recapitalized and remain solvent in a crisis. 
Furthermore, the draft legislation provides that SIBs will pay the Swiss Confederation an annual fee to mitigate a potential 
impact on competition and to compensate the Swiss Confederation for its guarantee to the SNB of the public liquidity 
backstop, if required. 
In addition to the public liquidity backstop, the proposed legislative changes would enact into ordinary law additional 
provisions contained in the Emergency Ordinance, including mandated clawback of variable compensation in the event 
that government support is provided to an SIB. 
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Regulatory and legal developments 57
The legislative changes are expected to come into force by January 2025, at the earliest, as in November 2023, the Swiss 
Parliament suspended discussions on the public liquidity backstop until the presentation of the Swiss Federal Council’s 
report on systemically important banks.
Furthermore, FINMA communicated in the third quarter of 2023 the liquidity requirements arising from the revisions to 
the Swiss Liquidity Ordinance, with the aim of strengthening the resilience of SIBs in Switzerland. The affected legal 
entities of the UBS Group are compliant with these requirements, which became effective on 1 January 2024.
Developments related to capital adequacy
In July 2023, US banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency (the OCC), issued a public consultation on a proposal that would implement the final components of the 
Basel III capital standards for US banking organizations and foreign-owned intermediate holding companies, such as UBS 
Americas Holding LLC and Credit Suisse Holdings (USA), Inc. Among other matters, the proposed rules would end the 
use of the internal model approach for credit risk by the largest banking organizations and would introduce instead a 
new standardized approach. In addition, the proposed rules for operational risks would replace the advanced 
measurement approach with a standardized measure. The proposal calls for a three-year transition period, starting on 
1 July 2025, and full implementation by 1 July 2028. We currently estimate that the proposed rule changes would result 
in increased capital requirements for our US-based intermediate holding companies if implemented as proposed.
In November 2023, the Swiss Federal Council adopted amendments to the Capital Adequacy Ordinance (the CAO) for 
banks to incorporate the final Basel III standards adopted by the BCBS in Swiss law. The amended CAO will enter into 
force on 1 January 2025. The final degree of alignment between the Swiss implementation and those in other jurisdictions 
remains uncertain at this stage. Although EU legislators target implementation by January 2025, the implementation 
timelines in the UK and the US have been delayed until July 2025. The Swiss Federal Department of Finance will inform 
the Swiss Federal Council about the status of international implementation by the end of July 2024. We currently estimate 
that the revised Basel III framework will lead to a further net increase in risk-weighted assets of approximately USD 25bn, 
of which USD 10bn is in Non-core and Legacy. This estimate is based on static balances, before taking into account 
mitigating actions, as well as not reflecting the impact of the output floor, which is phased in over time.
Developments related to TBTF frameworks
In August 2023, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC issued joint proposals on long-term debt requirements and 
resolution planning guidance for large banks. The long-term debt proposal would require certain large bank-holding 
companies, intermediate holding companies and insured depositories with USD 100bn or more in total assets to maintain 
a minimum amount of long-term debt, intended to enhance the resilience and resolvability of such organizations. Large 
banking organizations would also be prohibited from certain activities that could complicate the resolution or would lead 
to contagion risks. If the proposals are implemented, UBS Bank USA would be subject to the long-term debt requirement, 
which would be incremental to the requirements already imposed upon its parent organization, UBS Americas Holding 
LLC. The resolution planning guidance proposed by US banking regulators would cover our US-based entities and calls 
for certain enhancements in the requirements of the submitted resolution plans.
In November 2023, the FSB published the 2023 list of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). UBS has been moved 
from Bucket 1 to Bucket 2, corresponding to an increased FSB common equity tier 1 capital surcharge requirement of 
1.5% from 1.0%, effective from 1 January 2025. Credit Suisse has been removed from the list. As UBS is subject to 
higher requirements under the Swiss CAO, the change does not affect the capital requirements applicable to UBS.
In February 2024, the FSB published its Peer Review of Switzerland, which examines Switzerland’s implementation of the 
FSB’s TBTF reforms for G-SIBs. The review states that although Swiss authorities have made important steps toward 
implementing an effective TBTF regime for G-SIBs, additional steps can be taken to further strengthen the Swiss TBTF 
framework. Recommendations include increasing supervisory resources, strengthening early intervention powers and 
enhancing the recovery and resolution regime.

Developments regarding climate-related financial risks and sustainable finance
In 2023, the Swiss National Council discussed the revision of the Act on the Reduction of CO2 Emissions (the CO2 Act), 
which contains measures to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990. The proposal is based on 
supplementing the existing CO2 Act with additional incentives to reduce emissions in different industry sectors of the 
economy. For the financial sector, it contains a provision mandating FINMA and the SNB to regularly assess climaterelated financial risks in the financial sector and to report the results, as well as potential measures, to the Swiss 
government. FINMA is currently collecting the data from the financial sector in order to be able to carry out the 
assessment in 2024. It is expected that the proposal will be formally adopted by the Swiss Parliament in spring 2024. 
In June 2023, the Swiss electorate voted in favor of the new Climate and Innovation Act (the CI Act). The CI Act defines 
a net-zero-by-2050 target for Switzerland, including interim targets for selected sectors of the Swiss economy covering 
scope 1 and 2 emissions. In addition, each Switzerland-domiciled company is required to set a net-zero target by 
1 January 2025. The CI Act also contains provisions for public funding to replace aged heating systems in buildings and 
for application of innovative technologies within companies. Article 9 of the CI Act requires the financial sector to make 
an effective contribution to the transition to net zero and sets the general goal of the alignment of financial resources to 
climate-friendly outcomes. Specific measures to achieve the targets will be proposed in the CO2 Act.
In December 2023, the Swiss Parliament added a provision on greenwashing to the Unfair Competition Act under which 
companies are required to make truthful and clear statements in relation to their climate impact that can be substantiated 
by objective and verifiable bases.
Also in December 2023, the Swiss Federal Council announced that it intends to further improve climate transparency for 
financial products and to further develop the voluntary Swiss Climate Scores (the SCS), which were introduced in 2022. 
The SCS provide investors with information about the extent to which their financial investments are compatible with 
climate goals. The updated SCS, which will apply from 1 January 2025, will continue to prescribe disclosures by financial 
institutions on climate alignment and climate change mitigation characteristics of financial products and will newly 
prescribe disclosure of exposures to renewable energy. UBS has committed to the voluntary use of the SCS.
In October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC approved guidance on the principles for climaterelated financial risk management. The final principles describe how climate-related risks can be addressed in the 
management of traditional financial risks. The principles cover six areas: governance; policies, procedures and limits; 
strategic planning; risk management; data, risk measurement and reporting; and scenario analysis. The guidance applies 
to our US-based operations. UBS is evaluating the guidance to ensure the principles are addressed by the relevant Group 
practices.
In June 2023, the International Sustainability Standards Board (the ISSB) finalized its first set of requirements for corporate 
disclosures regarding sustainability matters: IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. IFRS S1 addresses the disclosure of a company’s 
sustainability-related risks and opportunities. IFRS S2 addresses the disclosures for the governance processes, controls 
and procedures an entity uses to monitor, manage and oversee climate-related risks and opportunities and the entity’s 
strategy for managing risks and opportunities. The standards incorporate the recommendations of the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the TCFD). These ISSB standards have been available for use from January 2024 
onward. UBS’s implementation of the standards will depend, among other factors, on whether the standards are adopted 
in jurisdictions in which UBS files financial reports.
In October 2023, the EU finalized the first set of cross-sectoral European Sustainability Reporting Standards (the ESRS) 
under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. In addition to general disclosures and requirements, the ESRS set 
out disclosure requirements, which are subject to a materiality assessment that is contingent on external assurance, 
effectively allowing companies to focus on reporting sustainability factors that are material to their businesses. Companies 
that were previously subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive and large non-EU listed companies with more than 
500 employees, including UBS, are required to begin reporting under the ESRS for the 2024 financial year, with the first 
reports to be published in 2025. The European Commission will develop and adopt additional sector-specific reporting 
standards by June 2026.
In March 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) released the final rules regarding climate-related 
disclosures for investors. The rules will require certain firms, including UBS, to disclose qualitative and quantitative 
information on the firm’s exposures to climate-related risks and risk management practices. The rules are anticipated to 
be effective for filings for the 2025 financial year.

Other developments in Switzerland
In June 2023, the Swiss electorate voted in favor of the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate of 15% applicable 
to companies with a consolidated turnover of more than EUR 750m, as stipulated by the Global Anti-Base Erosion Model 
Rules (Pillar Two) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In December 2023, the Swiss Federal 
Council decided on a partial adoption in Switzerland, by way of an ordinance, and, as a result, a domestic minimum topup tax regime became effective from 1 January 2024, ensuring a Swiss local minimal tax burden of at least 15%. 
Switzerland will not implement any top-up tax regime in 2024 with respect to non-Swiss taxation below 15%. The Swiss 
Federal Council will further observe international developments and decide at a later stage if and when any top-up tax 
with respect to non-Swiss taxation below 15% will be introduced in Switzerland. UBS does not expect the implementation 
of global minimum taxation in Switzerland to materially impact its effective tax rate.
In August 2023, the Swiss Federal Council launched a consultation on a bill to strengthen the Swiss anti-moneylaundering framework, with the aim of reinforcing the integrity and competitiveness of Switzerland as a financial and 
business location. The measures aim to comply with the international standards of the Financial Action Task Force (the 
FATF). Among other matters, key elements of the proposal include the introduction of a non-public register managed by 
the Federal Department of Justice and Police containing information about the beneficial owners of companies and other 
legal entities in Switzerland, as well as due diligence requirements for activities with an increased risk of money 
laundering. In the context of the Swiss anti-money-laundering framework, the FATF also acknowledged in October 2023 
the progress made by Switzerland, especially with the revision of the Anti-Money Laundering Act adopted in March 2021.
In November 2023, the Swiss Federal Council adopted an amendment to the Financial Market Infrastructure Act that 
enacts a measure aimed at protecting the Swiss stock exchange infrastructure into Swiss law with effect from 1 January 
2024. This ruling followed the EU’s decision to withdraw equivalence for the Swiss stock exchange regulation in 2019. 
The protective measure enables EU firms to trade Swiss shares on the Swiss trading venues, even without EU equivalence. 
In the event of equivalence recognition by the EU, the measure may be deactivated at any time.
In the first quarter of 2023, the Swiss Federal Council implemented the remaining measures of the 9th and 10th sanctions 
packages imposed by the EU against Russia in December 2022 and February 2023, respectively. The measures include 
additional export restrictions and more detailed reporting obligations with regard to frozen assets. 
In August 2023, the Swiss Federal Council adopted the EU’s 11th package of sanctions against Russia, which was partially 
adopted by Switzerland in June 2023 by expanding the sanction lists. As part of the 11th sanctions package, the EU has 
created a specific legal basis for an instrument to prevent the evasion of sanctions. The Swiss Federal Council emphasized 
its determination to take effective action against the evasion of sanctions and will examine the implementation of this 
instrument in the event of its actual application by the EU. In addition, Switzerland joined the EU in imposing sanctions 
at Moldova’s request and against Belarus, in view of its continued involvement in Russia’s ongoing military aggression 
against Ukraine. 
In September 2023, the Swiss Federal Council issued sanctions measures in connection with the delivery of Iranian drones 
to Russia. The sale, supply, export and transit of components used in the construction and production of drones is now 
prohibited. In January 2024, the Swiss Federal Council adopted the measures of the EU’s 12th sanctions package relevant 
to Switzerland, following the expansion of the sanction lists by Switzerland in December 2023. The measures include 
import bans on certain goods that generate significant revenue for Russia, as well as certain bans in the financial and 
services sectors. In February 2024, the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research adopted 
measures of the EU’s 13th sanctions package, which target, among others, individuals, entities and organizations that 
are operating in Russia’s military-industrial complex and that are involved in supplying defense equipment from the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as well as officials from the occupied territories of Ukraine.
UBS’s sanctions programs are designed to comply with sanctions across multiple jurisdictions, including those imposed 
by the United Nations, Switzerland, the EU, the UK and the US.
The revised Swiss Federal Data Protection Act and the corresponding Data Protection Ordinance entered into force on 
1 September 2023. The revised law represents a fundamental reform that strengthens the rights of consumers regarding 
their data by enhancing the transparency and accountability rules for companies processing data, among other measures. 
In addition, it seeks to align Swiss data protection law with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, in order to ensure 
continued cross-border transmission of data with EU Member States.
Other developments in the US
In October 2023, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the OCC adopted revisions to their regulations implementing 
the Community Reinvestment Act (the CRA). The CRA encourages banks to meet the credit needs of the communities in 
which they do business, with a focus on low- and moderate-income communities. The final rule will implement separate 
evaluations for retail lending, retail services and products, community development financing, and community 
development services for banks with over USD 2bn in total assets. For large banks with over USD 10bn in total assets, 
the evaluation of retail services and products will cover digital delivery systems. The final rule also updates requirements 
on the reporting of exposures. The rule has an implementation date of 1 April 2024, with additional phase-in periods for 
general provisions and reporting that extend out to April 2027. UBS Bank USA expects a modest level of increased 
monitoring and reporting requirements.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Regulatory and legal developments 60
In October 2022, the SEC adopted rules requiring US national securities exchanges, including the New York Stock 
Exchange (the NYSE) and Nasdaq, to adopt listing standards that require issuers to adopt and enforce a policy to recover 
from executive officers incentive compensation received based on attainment of a financial reporting measure in the 
event that the issuer is required to prepare an accounting restatement of financial statements due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. The SEC approved the listing standards promulgated by the NYSE and 
Nasdaq in June 2023 and the clawback policy requirement came into effect as of 1 December 2023. Under the listing 
standards, an issuer must recover the amount of incentive-based compensation that would not have been received if it 
had been determined based on the restated financial information. UBS Group AG, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG each 
have securities listed on US national securities exchanges and have adopted a policy to comply with the listing standards.
In September 2023, the new rules from the SEC to enhance and standardize disclosure requirements related to 
cybersecurity incidents and cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance became effective. Among other 
changes, the rules require foreign private issuers, including UBS Group AG, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG, to annually 
report material information regarding their cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance on Form 20-F. The 
Form 20-F disclosures are applicable with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after 15 December 2023.
Other developments in Europe
US securities markets will transition to one business day after the trade date (T+1) settlement of most transactions in May 
2024. In October 2023, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) launched a call for evidence on shortening 
the standard settlement cycle for securities transactions from two business days after the trade date (T+2) to T+1. ESMA 
aims to perform an assessment of the costs and benefits linked to the potential reduction of the securities settlement 
cycle in the EU and intends to submit the results of its assessment to the European Commission and publish a final report 
in the fourth quarter of 2024, at the latest. The UK Treasury has also established an Accelerated Settlement Taskforce to 
consider whether the UK should follow the US and transition to a T+1 settlement. The UK task force is expected to 
publish its findings in 2024, with further work expected during 2024. UBS is implementing and testing required 
enhancements based on the US rules and will prepare for further implementation according to the evolving rules and 
market practice in the UK, the EU and Switzerland. 
In May 2023, the European Commission presented draft legislative proposals aimed at empowering retail investors to 
make investment decisions that are aligned with their needs and preferences and ensuring that they are treated fairly 
and duly protected. The proposals also aim to encourage greater participation in EU capital markets and to enable a 
greater volume of funds to flow more easily into EU capital markets. The package revises EU capital markets rules, which, 
once agreed and in force, could have significant implications and require significant implementation efforts by UBS across 
business divisions.
In June 2023, legislators in the EU reached a provisional agreement on amendments to the Capital Requirements 
Regulation and the Capital Requirements Directive. The provisional agreement includes, alongside measures to implement 
the remaining elements of the Basel III standard, a framework that would require non-EU firms to establish a physical 
presence within the EU when providing certain banking services to EU-domiciled clients and counterparties (including 
deposit-taking and commercial lending), unless they are subject to an exemption. The changes will affect the cross-border 
provision of certain banking services and will require UBS to adapt its approaches to providing such services to clients in 
the EU. The requirement is expected to become effective in late 2026, with grandfathering provisions for contracts already 
in existence at the date of introduction.
In December 2023, the Swiss Confederation and the UK signed a mutual recognition agreement (an MRA) for financial 
services to facilitate cross-border financial activities. The MRA is supplemented by measures to enhance supervisory 
cooperation and coordination. The MRA envisages a memorandum of understanding between FINMA and the Bank of 
England on resolution arrangements, and it is expected to enable Swiss banks to provide cross-border investment services 
to high net worth UK-domiciled clients and to broadly allow UK and Swiss over-the-counter derivatives counterparties to 
choose whether to rely on Swiss or UK risk mitigation rules (except for physically settled foreign exchange swaps and 
forwards). The agreement is expected to apply from 2026, depending on the completion of parliamentary approval in 
both countries.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 61
Risk factors
Certain risks, including those described below, may affect our ability to execute our strategy or our business activities, 
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We are inherently exposed to multiple risks, many of which may 
become apparent only with the benefit of hindsight. As a result, risks that we do not consider to be material, or of which 
we are not currently aware, could also adversely affect us. Within each category, the risks that we consider to be most 
material are presented first. 
Strategy, management and operational risks
UBS’s acquisition of Credit Suisse Group AG exposes UBS to heightened litigation risk and regulatory scrutiny and 
entails significant additional costs, liabilities and business integration risks
UBS acquired Credit Suisse Group AG under exceptional circumstances of volatile financial markets and the continued 
outflows and deteriorating overall financial position of Credit Suisse, in order to avert a failure of Credit Suisse and thus 
damage to the Swiss financial center and to global financial stability. The acquisition was effected through a merger of 
Credit Suisse Group AG with and into UBS Group AG, with UBS Group AG succeeding to all assets and all liabilities of 
Credit Suisse Group AG, becoming the direct or indirect shareholder of the former direct and indirect subsidiaries of 
Credit Suisse Group AG. Therefore, on a consolidated basis, all assets, risks and liabilities of the Credit Suisse Group 
became a part of UBS. This includes all ongoing and future litigation, regulatory and similar matters arising out of the 
business of the Credit Suisse Group, thereby materially increasing UBS’s exposure to litigation and investigation risks, as 
described in further detail below.
We have incurred substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the transaction and will continue to incur 
substantial integration and restructuring costs. In addition, we may not realize all of the expected cost reductions and 
other benefits of the transaction. We may not be able to successfully execute our strategic plans or to achieve the 
expected benefits of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. The success of the transaction, including anticipated 
benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on the ability to successfully integrate the operations of both firms rapidly 
and effectively, while maintaining stability of operations and high levels of service to customers of the combined franchise. 
Our ability to successfully integrate Credit Suisse will depend on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our 
control, including our ability to:
– combine the operations of the two firms in a manner that preserves client service, simplifies infrastructure and results 
in operating cost savings;
– reverse outflows of deposits and client invested assets at Credit Suisse, particularly in its Wealth Management division 
and in Switzerland, and to attract additional deposits and other client assets to the combined firm;
– achieve cost reductions at the levels and in the time frame we plan;
– enhance, integrate and, where necessary, remediate risk management and financial control and other systems and 
frameworks, including to remediate the material weaknesses in Credit Suisse’s internal controls over financial 
reporting; 
– simplify the legal structure of the combined firm in an expedited manner, through the planned mergers of UBS AG 
and Credit Suisse AG and of UBS Switzerland AG and Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG, as well as the creation of a single 
intermediate holding company (an IHC) for the combined firm in the US, other entity mergers and consolidations and 
asset dispositions, including obtaining regulatory approvals and licenses required to implement such changes;
– retain staff and to reverse attrition of staff in certain of Credit Suisse’s business areas;
– successfully execute the wind-down of the assets and liabilities in our Non-core and Legacy division and release capital 
and resources for other purposes; and 
– resolve outstanding litigation, regulatory and similar matters, including matters relating to Credit Suisse, on terms that 
are not significantly adverse to the UBS Group, as well as to successfully remediate outstanding regulatory and 
supervisory matters and meet other regulatory commitments.
Further investigation and planning for integration is taking place, and risks that we do not currently consider to be 
material, or of which we are not currently aware, could also adversely affect us.
The level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and their businesses, 
particularly in the area of the Swiss domestic bank, as well as the domestic and international wealth management 
businesses, the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reductions and divestment of any non-core assets, and 
the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, may impact the operational results, share price and the credit rating 
of UBS entities. The past financial performance of each of UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse may not be indicative of their 
future financial performance. In addition, the financial effects of management decisions and transactions will likely differ 
between UBS Group and Credit Suisse as a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting under IFRS 
by UBS Group, including valuation adjustments recorded by UBS Group, as well as other differences between US GAAP 
accounting principles applied by Credit Suisse and IFRS Accounting Standards applied by UBS Group. The combined 
Group will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating its business practices 
and support functions. The diversion of management’s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection 
with the transaction and the coordination of the two companies’ operations could have an adverse effect on the business, 
financial results, financial condition or the share price of the combined Group following the transaction. The coordination 
process may also result in additional and unforeseen expenses.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 62
Our reputation is critical to our success
Our reputation is critical to the success of our strategic plans, business and prospects. Reputational damage is difficult to 
reverse, and improvements tend to be slow and difficult to measure. In the past, our reputation has been adversely 
affected by our losses during the 2008 financial crisis, investigations into our cross-border private banking services, 
criminal resolutions of London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR)-related and foreign exchange matters, as well as other 
matters. We believe that reputational damage as a result of these events was an important factor in our loss of clients 
and client assets across our asset-gathering businesses. The Credit Suisse Group was more recently subject to significant 
litigation and regulatory matters and to financial losses that adversely affected its reputation and the confidence of clients, 
which played a significant role in the events leading to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in March 2023. These 
events, or new events that cause reputational damage, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation 
and financial condition, as well as our ability to achieve our strategic goals and financial targets.
Operational risks affect our business
Our businesses depend on our ability to process a large number of transactions, many of which are complex, across 
multiple and diverse markets in different currencies, to comply with requirements of many different legal and regulatory 
regimes to which we are subject and to prevent, or promptly detect and stop, unauthorized, fictitious or fraudulent 
transactions. We also rely on access to, and on the functioning of, systems maintained by third parties, including clearing 
systems, exchanges, information processors and central counterparties. Any failure of our or third-party systems could 
have an adverse effect on us. These risks may be greater as we deploy newer technologies, such as blockchain, or 
processes, platforms or products that rely on these technologies. Our operational risk management and control systems 
and processes are designed to help ensure that the risks associated with our activities – including those arising from 
process error, failed execution, misconduct, unauthorized trading, fraud, system failures, financial crime, cyberattacks, 
breaches of information security, inadequate or ineffective access controls and failure of security and physical protection 
– are appropriately controlled. If our internal controls fail or prove ineffective in identifying and remedying these risks, 
we could suffer operational failures that might result in material losses, such as the substantial loss we incurred from the 
unauthorized trading incident announced in September 2011. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group may elevate 
these risks, particularly during the first phases of integration, as the firms have historically operated under different 
procedures, IT systems, risk policies and structures of governance.
As a significant proportion of our staff have been and will continue working from outside the office, we have faced, and 
will continue to face, new challenges and operational risks, including maintenance of supervisory and surveillance 
controls, as well as increased fraud and data security risks. While we have taken measures to manage these risks, these 
measures could prove not to be effective.
We use automation as part of our efforts to improve efficiency, reduce the risk of error and improve our client experience. 
We intend to expand the use of robotic processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to further these goals. 
Use of these tools presents their own risks, including the need for effective design and testing; the quality of the data 
used for development and operation of machine learning and AI tools may adversely affect their functioning and result 
in errors and other operational risks.
Financial services firms have increasingly been subject to breaches of security and to cyber- and other forms of attack, 
some of which are sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to gain access to confidential information or systems, 
disrupt service or steal or destroy data, which may result in business disruption or the corruption or loss of data at UBS’s 
locations or those of third parties. Cyberattacks by hackers, terrorists, criminal organizations, nation states and extremists 
have also increased in frequency and sophistication. Current geopolitical tensions have also led to increased risk of 
cyberattack from foreign state actors. In particular, the Russia–Ukraine war and the imposition of significant sanctions 
on Russia by Switzerland, the US, the EU, the UK and others has resulted and may continue to result in an increase in the 
risk of cyberattacks. Such attacks may occur on our own systems or on the systems that are operated by external service 
providers, may be attempted through the introduction of ransomware, viruses or malware, phishing and other forms of 
social engineering, distributed denial of service attacks and other means. These attempts may occur directly or using 
equipment or security passwords of our employees, third-party service providers or other users. Cybersecurity risks also 
have increased due to the widespread use of digital technologies, cloud computing and mobile devices to conduct 
financial business and transactions, as well as due to generative AI, which increases the capabilities of adversaries to 
mount sophisticated phishing attacks, for example, through the use of deepfake technologies, and presents new 
challenges to the protection of our systems and networks and the confidentiality and integrity of our data. During the 
first quarter of 2023, a third-party vendor, ION XTP, suffered a ransomware attack, which resulted in some disruption to 
our exchange-traded derivatives clearing activities, although we restored our services within 36 hours, using an available 
alternative solution. In addition to external attacks, we have experienced loss of client data from failure by employees 
and others to follow internal policies and procedures and from misappropriation of our data by employees and others. 
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 63
We may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or data and our preventative measures may 
not be effective to prevent an attack or a security breach. In the event of a security breach, notwithstanding our 
preventative measures, we may not immediately detect a particular breach or attack. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse 
Group may elevate and intensify these risks, as would-be attackers have a larger potential target in the combined bank 
and differences in systems, policies, and platforms could make threat detection more difficult. In addition, the 
implementation of the large-scale technological change program that is necessary to integrate the combined bank’s 
systems at pace may also result in increased risks. Once a particular attack is detected, time may be required to investigate 
and assess the nature and extent of the attack, and to restore and test systems and data. If a successful attack occurs at 
a service provider, as we have recently experienced, we may be dependent on the service provider’s ability to detect the 
attack, investigate and assess the attack and successfully restore the relevant systems and data. A successful breach or 
circumvention of security of our systems or data or those of a service provider could have significant negative 
consequences for us, including disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information concerning us 
or our clients, damage to our systems, financial losses for us or our clients, violations of data privacy and similar laws, 
litigation exposure, and damage to our reputation. We may be subject to enforcement actions as regulatory focus on 
cybersecurity increases and regulators have announced new rules, guidance and initiatives on ransomware and other 
cybersecurity-related issues.
We are subject to complex and frequently changing laws and regulations governing the protection of client and personal 
data, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Ensuring that we comply with applicable laws and regulations 
when we collect, use and transfer personal information requires substantial resources and may affect the ways in which 
we conduct our business. In the event that we fail to comply with applicable laws, we may be exposed to regulatory fines 
and penalties and other sanctions. We may also incur such penalties if our vendors or other service providers or clients 
or counterparties fail to comply with these laws or to maintain appropriate controls over protected data. In addition, any 
loss or exposure of client or other data may adversely damage our reputation and adversely affect our business.
A major focus of US and other countries’ governmental policies relating to financial institutions in recent years has been 
on fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. We are required to maintain effective policies, procedures and 
controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing, and to verify the identity of our clients 
under the laws of many of the countries in which we operate. We are also subject to laws and regulations related to 
corrupt and illegal payments to government officials by others, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK 
Bribery Act. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws 
and regulations. Notwithstanding this, US regulators have found deficiencies in the design and operation of anti-moneylaundering programs in our US operations. We have undertaken a significant program to address these regulatory 
findings with the objective of fully meeting regulatory expectations for our programs. Failure to maintain and implement 
adequate programs to combat money laundering, terrorist financing or corruption, or any failure of our programs in 
these areas, could have serious consequences both from legal enforcement action and from damage to our reputation. 
Frequent changes in sanctions imposed and increasingly complex sanctions imposed on countries, entities and individuals, 
as exemplified by the breadth and scope of the sanctions imposed in relation to the war in Ukraine, increase our cost of 
monitoring and complying with sanctions requirements and increase the risk that we will not identify in a timely manner 
client activity that is subject to a sanction.
As a result of new and changed regulatory requirements and the changes we have made in our legal structure, the 
volume, frequency and complexity of our regulatory and other reporting has remained elevated. Regulators have also 
significantly increased expectations regarding our internal reporting and data aggregation, as well as management 
reporting. We have incurred, and continue to incur, significant costs to implement infrastructure to meet these 
requirements. Failure to meet external reporting requirements accurately and in a timely manner or failure to meet 
regulatory expectations of internal reporting, data aggregation and management reporting could result in enforcement 
action or other adverse consequences for us.
In addition, despite the contingency plans that we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected 
by disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we operate. This may 
include disruption due to natural disasters, pandemics, civil unrest, war or terrorism and involve electrical, 
communications, transportation or other services that we use or that are used by third parties with whom we conduct 
business.
We depend on our risk management and control processes to avoid or limit potential losses in our businesses 
Controlled risk-taking is a major part of the business of a financial services firm. Some losses from risk-taking activities 
are inevitable, but, to be successful over time, we must balance the risks we take against the returns generated. Therefore, 
we must diligently identify, assess, manage and control our risks, not only in normal market conditions but also as they 
might develop under more extreme, stressed conditions, when concentrations of exposures can lead to severe losses. 
We have not always been able to prevent serious losses arising from risk management failures and extreme or sudden 
market events. We recorded substantial losses on fixed-income trading positions in the 2008 financial crisis, in the 
unauthorized trading incident in 2011 and, more recently, positions resulting from the default of a US prime brokerage 
client. In the recent past, the Credit Suisse Group has suffered very significant losses from the default of the US prime 
brokerage client, the losses in supply chain finance funds (SCFF) managed by it, as well as other matters. As a result of 
these, Credit Suisse is subject to significant regulatory remediation obligations to address deficiencies in its risk 
management and control systems, that continue following the merger.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 64
We regularly revise and strengthen our risk management and control frameworks to seek to address identified 
shortcomings. Nonetheless, we could suffer further losses in the future if, for example:
– we do not fully identify the risks in our portfolio, in particular risk concentrations and correlated risks;
– our assessment of the risks identified, or our response to negative trends, proves to be untimely, inadequate, 
insufficient or incorrect; 
– our risk models prove insufficient to predict the scale of financial risks the bank faces; 
– markets move in ways that we do not expect – in terms of their speed, direction, severity or correlation – and our 
ability to manage risks in the resulting environment is, therefore, affected;
– third parties to whom we have credit exposure or whose securities we hold are severely affected by events and we 
suffer defaults and impairments beyond the level implied by our risk assessment; or 
– collateral or other security provided by our counterparties and clients proves inadequate to cover their obligations at 
the time of default. 
We also hold legacy risk positions, primarily in Non-core and Legacy, that, in many cases, are illiquid and may deteriorate 
in value. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has increased, materially, the portfolio of business that is outside of 
our risk appetite and subject to exit that will be managed in the Non-core and Legacy segment.
We also manage risk on behalf of our clients. The performance of assets we hold for our clients may be adversely affected 
by the same aforementioned factors. If clients suffer losses or the performance of their assets held with us is not in line 
with relevant benchmarks against which clients assess investment performance, we may suffer reduced fee income and 
a decline in assets under management, or withdrawal of mandates.
Investment positions, such as equity investments made as part of strategic initiatives and seed investments made at the 
inception of funds that we manage, may also be affected by market risk factors. These investments are often not liquid 
and generally are intended or required to be held beyond a normal trading horizon. Deteriorations in the fair value of 
these positions would have a negative effect on our earnings.
We may be unable to identify or capture revenue or competitive opportunities, or retain and attract qualified 
employees
The financial services industry is characterized by intense competition, continuous innovation, restrictive, detailed and 
sometimes fragmented regulation and ongoing consolidation. We face competition at the level of local markets and 
individual business lines and from global financial institutions that are comparable to us in their size and breadth, as well 
as competition from new technology-based market entrants, which may not be subject to the same level of regulation. 
Barriers to entry in individual markets and pricing levels are being eroded by new technology. We expect these trends to 
continue and competition to increase. Our competitive strength and market position could be eroded if we are unable 
to identify market trends and developments, do not respond to such trends and developments by devising and 
implementing adequate business strategies, do not adequately develop or update our technology, including our digital 
channels and tools, or are unable to attract or retain the qualified people needed.
The amount and structure of our employee compensation is affected not only by our business results but also by 
competitive factors and regulatory considerations. 
In response to the demands of various stakeholders, including regulatory authorities and shareholders, and in order to 
better align the interests of our staff with other stakeholders, we have increased average deferral periods for stock 
awards, expanded forfeiture provisions and, to a more limited extent, introduced clawback provisions for certain awards 
linked to business performance. We have also introduced individual caps on the proportion of fixed to variable pay for 
the members of the Group Executive Board (GEB), as well as certain other employees. UBS will also be required to 
introduce and enforce provisions requiring UBS to recover from GEB members and certain other executives a portion of 
performance-based incentive compensation in the event that the UBS Group or another entity with securities listed on a 
US national securities exchange, is required to restate its financial statements as a result of a material error.
Constraints on the amount or structure of employee compensation, higher levels of deferral, performance conditions and 
other circumstances triggering the forfeiture of unvested awards may adversely affect our ability to retain and attract key 
employees, particularly where we compete with companies that are not subject to these constraints. The loss of key staff 
and the inability to attract qualified replacements could seriously compromise our ability to execute our strategy and to 
successfully improve our operating and control environment, and could affect our business performance. This risk is 
intensified by elevated levels of attrition among Credit Suisse employees. Swiss law requires that shareholders approve 
the compensation of the Board of Directors (the BoD) and the GEB each year. If our shareholders fail to approve the 
compensation for the GEB or the BoD, this could have an adverse effect on our ability to retain experienced directors and 
our senior management.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 65
As UBS Group AG is a holding company, its operating results, financial condition and ability to pay dividends and other 
distributions and / or to pay its obligations in the future depend on funding, dividends and other distributions received 
directly or indirectly from its subsidiaries, which may be subject to restrictions
UBS Group AG’s ability to pay dividends and other distributions and to pay its obligations in the future will depend on 
the level of funding, dividends and other distributions, if any, received from UBS AG and other subsidiaries. The ability of 
such subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, to UBS Group AG may be restricted as a result of 
several factors, including restrictions in financing agreements and the requirements of applicable law and regulatory, 
fiscal or other restrictions. In particular, UBS Group AG’s direct and indirect subsidiaries, including UBS AG, Credit Suisse 
AG, UBS Switzerland AG, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG, UBS Americas Holding LLC, Credit Suisse Holdings (USA) Inc., UBS 
Europe SE and Credit Suisse International, are subject to laws and regulations that require the entities to maintain 
minimum levels of capital and liquidity, that restrict dividend payments, that authorize regulatory bodies to block or 
reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to UBS Group AG or that could affect their ability to repay any loans 
made to, or other investments in, such subsidiary by UBS Group AG or another member of the Group. For example, in 
the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Central Bank ordered all banks under its supervision to cease 
dividend distributions, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System limited capital distributions by bank 
holding companies and intermediate holding companies. Restrictions and regulatory actions could impede access to 
funds that UBS Group AG may need to meet its obligations or to pay dividends to shareholders. In addition, UBS Group 
AG’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to all prior 
claims of the subsidiary’s creditors.
Our capital instruments may contractually prevent us from proposing the distribution of dividends to shareholders, other 
than in the form of shares, and from engaging in repurchases of shares, if we do not pay interest on these instruments.
Furthermore, UBS Group AG may guarantee some of the payment obligations of certain of the Group’s subsidiaries from 
time to time. These guarantees may require UBS Group AG to provide substantial funds or assets to subsidiaries or their 
creditors or counterparties at a time when UBS Group AG is in need of liquidity to fund its own obligations.
The credit ratings of UBS Group AG or its subsidiaries used for funding purposes could be lower than the ratings of the 
Group’s operating subsidiaries, which may adversely affect the market value of the securities and other obligations of 
UBS Group AG or those subsidiaries on a standalone basis.
Market, credit and macroeconomic risks
Performance in the financial services industry is affected by market conditions and the macroeconomic climate
Our businesses are materially affected by market and macroeconomic conditions. A market downturn and weak 
macroeconomic conditions can be precipitated by a number of factors, including geopolitical events, such as international 
armed conflicts, war, or acts of terrorism, the imposition of sanctions, global trade or global supply chain disruptions, 
including energy shortages and food insecurity, changes in monetary or fiscal policy, changes in trade policies or 
international trade disputes, significant inflationary or deflationary price changes, disruptions in one or more concentrated 
economic sectors, natural disasters, pandemics or local and regional civil unrest. Such developments can have 
unpredictable and destabilizing effects. 
Adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, securities prices, market volatility and liquidity, foreign exchange rates, 
commodity prices, and other market fluctuations, as well as changes in investor sentiment, can affect our earnings and 
ultimately our financial and capital positions. As financial markets are global and highly interconnected, local and regional 
events can have widespread effects well beyond the countries in which they occur. Any of these developments may 
adversely affect our business or financial results.
As a result of significant volatility in the market, our businesses may experience a decrease in client activity levels and 
market volumes, which would adversely affect our ability to generate transaction fees, commissions and margins, 
particularly in Global Wealth Management and the Investment Bank. A market downturn would likely reduce the volume 
and valuation of assets that we manage on behalf of clients, which would reduce recurring fee income that is charged 
based on invested assets, primarily in Global Wealth Management and Asset Management, and performance-based fees 
in Asset Management. Such a downturn could also cause a decline in the value of assets that we own and account for 
as investments or trading positions. In addition, reduced market liquidity or volatility may limit trading opportunities and 
therefore may reduce transaction-based income and may also impede our ability to manage risks.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 66
Health emergencies, including pandemics and measures taken by governmental authorities to manage them, may have 
effects such as labor market displacements, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary pressures, and adversely affect 
global and regional economic conditions, resulting in contraction in the global economy, substantial volatility in the 
financial markets, crises in markets for goods and services, disruptions in real estate markets, increased unemployment, 
increased credit and counterparty risk, and operational challenges, as we saw with the COVID-19 pandemic. Such 
economic or market disruptions, including inflationary pressures, may lead to reduced levels of client activity and demand 
for our products and services, increased utilization of lending commitments, significantly increased client defaults, 
continued and increasing credit and valuation losses in our loan portfolios, loan commitments and other assets, and 
impairments of other financial assets. A fall in equity markets and a consequent decline in invested assets would also 
reduce recurring fee income in our Global Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses, as we experienced 
in the second quarter of 2022. These factors and other consequences of a health emergency may negatively affect our 
financial condition, including possible constraints on capital and liquidity, as well as resulting in a higher cost of capital, 
and possible downgrades to our credit ratings.
Geopolitical events: Terrorist activity and escalating armed conflict in the Middle East, as well as the continuing Russia–
Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures and slow global 
growth. In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to 
shortages of vital commodities, including energy shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in 
armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect to the Russia–Ukraine war, 
coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and 
the uncertainty as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse 
effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, including in ways that cannot be anticipated. If individual countries 
impose restrictions on cross-border payments or trade, or other exchange or capital controls, or change their currency 
(for example, if one or more countries should leave the Eurozone, as a result of the imposition of sanctions on individuals, 
entities or countries, or escalation of trade restrictions and other actions between the US, or other countries, and China), 
we could suffer adverse effects on our business, losses from enforced default by counterparties, be unable to access our 
own assets or be unable to effectively manage our risks.
We could be materially affected if a crisis develops, regionally or globally, as a result of disruptions in markets due to 
macroeconomic or political developments, trade restrictions, or the failure of a major market participant. Over time, our 
strategic plans have become more heavily dependent on our ability to generate growth and revenue in emerging markets, 
including China, causing us to be more exposed to the risks associated with such markets.
Global Wealth Management derives revenues from all the principal regions but has a greater concentration in Asia than 
many peers and a substantial presence in the US, unlike many European peers. The Investment Bank’s business is more 
heavily weighted to Europe and Asia than our peers, while its derivatives business is more heavily weighted to structured 
products for wealth management clients, in particular with European and Asian underlyings. Our performance may 
therefore be more affected by political, economic and market developments in these regions and businesses than some 
other financial service providers.
The extent to which ongoing conflicts, current inflationary pressures and related adverse economic conditions affect our 
businesses, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend 
on future developments, including the effects of the current conditions on our clients, counterparties, employees and 
third-party service providers.
Our credit risk exposure to clients, trading counterparties and other financial institutions would increase under adverse 
or other economic conditions
Credit risk is an integral part of many of our activities, including lending, underwriting and derivatives activities. Adverse 
economic or market conditions, or the imposition of sanctions or other restrictions on clients, counterparties or financial 
institutions, may lead to impairments and defaults on these credit exposures. Losses may be exacerbated by declines in 
the value of collateral securing loans and other exposures. In our prime brokerage, securities finance and Lombard lending 
businesses, we extend substantial amounts of credit against securities collateral the value or liquidity of which may decline 
rapidly. Market closures and the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other measures may limit our ability to 
settle existing transactions or to realize on collateral, which may result in unexpected increases in exposures. Our Swiss 
mortgage and corporate lending portfolios, which have increased substantially as a result of the Credit Suisse acquisition, 
are a large part of our overall lending. We are therefore exposed to the risk of adverse economic developments in 
Switzerland, including property valuations in the housing market, the strength of the Swiss franc and its effect on Swiss 
exports, a return to negative interest rates applied by the Swiss National Bank, economic conditions within the Eurozone 
or the EU, and the evolution of agreements between Switzerland and the EU or European Economic Area, which 
represent Switzerland’s largest export market. We have exposures related to real estate in various countries, including a 
substantial Swiss mortgage portfolio. Although we believe this portfolio is prudently managed, we could nevertheless be 
exposed to losses if a substantial deterioration in the Swiss real estate market were to occur. 
As we experienced in 2020, under the IFRS 9 expected credit loss (ECL) regime, credit loss expenses may increase rapidly 
at the onset of an economic downturn as a result of higher levels of credit impairments (stage 3), as well as higher ECL 
from stages 1 and 2. Substantial increases in ECL could exceed expected loss for regulatory capital purposes and adversely 
affect our common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and regulatory capital ratios.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 67
Interest rate trends and changes could negatively affect our financial results
UBS’s businesses are sensitive to changes in interest rate trends. A prolonged period of low or negative interest rates, 
particularly in Switzerland and the Eurozone, adversely affected the net interest income generated by UBS’s Personal & 
Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management businesses prior to 2022. Actions that UBS took to mitigate adverse 
effects on income, such as the introduction of selective deposit fees or minimum lending rates, contributed to outflows 
of customer deposits (a key source of funding for UBS), net new money outflows and a declining market share in its 
Swiss lending business.
During 2022, interest rates increased sharply in the US and most other markets, including a shift from negative to positive 
central bank policy rates in the Eurozone and Switzerland, as central banks responded to higher inflation. Higher interest 
rates generally benefit UBS’s net interest income. However, as returns on alternatives to deposits increase with rising 
interest rates, such as returns on money market funds, UBS experienced outflows from customer deposits and shifts of 
deposits from lower-interest account types to accounts bearing higher interest rates, such as savings and certificates of 
deposit, starting with effects in the US, where rates had rapidly increased. In addition, higher-for-longer interest rates, 
such as those experienced in 2023, have led to similar shifts in euro and Swiss franc deposits. Sustained higher interest 
rates also may adversely affect our credit counterparties. Customer deposit outflows could require UBS to obtain 
alternative funding, which would likely be more costly than customer deposits. 
Our shareholders’ equity and capital are also affected by changes in interest rates.
Currency fluctuation may have an adverse effect on our profits, balance sheet and regulatory capital
We are subject to currency fluctuation risks as a substantial portion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in 
currencies other than our Group presentation currency, the US dollar. In order to hedge our CET1 capital ratio, our CET1 
capital must have foreign currency exposure, which leads to currency sensitivity. As a consequence, it is not possible to 
simultaneously fully hedge both CET1 capital and the CET1 capital ratio. Accordingly, changes in foreign exchange rates 
may adversely affect our profits, balance sheet, and capital, leverage and liquidity coverage ratios. 
Regulatory and legal risks
Material legal and regulatory risks arise in the conduct of our business
As a global financial services firm operating in more than 50 countries, we are subject to many different legal, tax and 
regulatory regimes, including extensive regulatory oversight, and are exposed to significant liability risk. We are subject 
to a large number of claims, disputes, legal proceedings and government investigations, and we expect that our ongoing 
business activities will continue to give rise to such matters in the future. In addition, as noted above, UBS inherited claims 
against Credit Suisse entities as part of the acquisition, including matters that may be material to the operating results of 
the combined Group such as the ongoing SCFF matter. The extent of our financial exposure to these and other matters 
is material and could substantially exceed the level of provisions that we have established. We are not able to predict the 
financial and non-financial consequences these matters may have when resolved. 
We may be subject to adverse preliminary determinations or court decisions that may negatively affect public perception 
and our reputation, result in prudential actions from regulators, and cause us to record additional provisions for such 
matters even when we believe we have substantial defenses and expect to ultimately achieve a more favorable outcome. 
This risk is illustrated by the award of aggregate penalties and damages of EUR 4.5bn by the court of first instance in 
France. This award was reduced to an aggregate of EUR 1.8bn by the Court of Appeal, and, in a further appeal, the 
French Supreme Court referred the case back to the Paris Court of Appeal to reconsider the amount after a new trial. 
Litigation, regulatory and similar matters may also result in non-monetary penalties and consequences. Among other 
things, a guilty plea to, or conviction of, a crime (including as a result of termination of the Deferred Prosecution 
Agreement Credit Suisse entered into with the US Department of Justice in 2021 to resolve its Mozambique matter) 
could have material consequences for UBS.
Resolution of regulatory proceedings has required us to obtain waivers of regulatory disqualifications to maintain certain 
operations, may entitle regulatory authorities to limit, suspend or terminate licenses and regulatory authorizations, and 
may permit financial market utilities to limit, suspend or terminate our participation in them. Failure to obtain such 
waivers, or any limitation, suspension or termination of licenses, authorizations or participations, could have material 
adverse consequences for us.
Our settlements with governmental authorities in connection with foreign exchange, LIBOR and other benchmark interest 
rates starkly illustrate the significantly increased level of financial and reputational risk now associated with regulatory 
matters in major jurisdictions. In connection with investigations related to LIBOR and other benchmark rates, and to 
foreign exchange and precious metals, very large fines and disgorgement amounts were assessed against us, and we 
were required to enter guilty pleas despite our full cooperation with the authorities in the investigations and despite our 
receipt of conditional leniency or conditional immunity from anti-trust authorities in a number of jurisdictions, including 
the US and Switzerland.
For a number of years, we have been, and we continue to be, subject to a very high level of regulatory scrutiny and to 
certain regulatory measures that constrain our strategic flexibility. We believe we have remediated the deficiencies that 
led to significant losses in the past and made substantial changes in our controls and conduct risk frameworks to address 
the issues highlighted by the LIBOR-related, foreign exchange and precious metals regulatory resolutions. We have also 
undertaken extensive efforts to implement new regulatory requirements and meet heightened expectations. 
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 68
Credit Suisse and UBS have become the target of lawsuits, and may become the target of further litigation, in connection 
with the merger transaction and / or the regulatory and other actions taken in connection with the merger transaction, 
all of which could result in substantial costs. Since the close of the acquisition, various litigation claims have been lodged 
against UBS under Swiss merger law alleging that Credit Suisse Group AG shareholders received disadvantaged treatment 
in the acquisition. In addition, numerous cases have been lodged against the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority 
(FINMA) in respect of the write-down of the Credit Suisse Group’s additional tier 1 (AT1) bonds ordered by FINMA. UBS 
Group AG, as the successor to Credit Suisse Group AG, is participating in proceedings as an aggrieved party. The 
cumulative effects of the litigations to which UBS has succeeded and the claims related to the acquisition and the 
circumstances surrounding it, may have material adverse consequences for the combined Group.
We continue to be in active dialogue with regulators concerning the actions we are taking to improve our operational 
risk management, risk control, anti-money-laundering, data management and other frameworks, and otherwise seek to 
meet supervisory expectations, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will have the desired effects. As a result of 
this history, our level of risk with respect to regulatory enforcement may be greater than that of some of our peers.
Substantial changes in regulation may adversely affect our businesses and our ability to execute our strategic plans
Since the financial crisis of 2008, we have been subject to significant regulatory requirements, including recovery and 
resolution planning, changes in capital and prudential standards, changes in taxation regimes as a result of changes in 
governmental administrations, new and revised market standards and fiduciary duties, as well as new and developing 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards and requirements. Notwithstanding attempts by regulators to 
align their efforts, the measures adopted or proposed for banking regulation differ significantly across the major 
jurisdictions, making it increasingly difficult to manage a global institution. Regulatory reviews of the events leading to 
the failures of US banks and our acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023, as well as regulatory measures to complete the 
implementation of the Basel 3 standards, may increase capital, liquidity and other requirements applicable to banks, 
including UBS. In addition, Swiss regulatory changes with regard to such matters as capital and liquidity have often 
proceeded more quickly than those in other major jurisdictions, and Switzerland’s requirements for major international 
banks are among the strictest of the major financial centers. This could put Swiss banks, such as UBS, at a disadvantage 
when competing with peer financial institutions subject to more lenient regulation or with unregulated non-bank 
competitors.
Our implementation of additional regulatory requirements and changes in supervisory standards, as well as our 
compliance with existing laws and regulations, continue to receive heightened scrutiny from supervisors. If we do not 
meet supervisory expectations in relation to these or other matters, or if additional supervisory or regulatory issues arise, 
we would likely be subject to further regulatory scrutiny, as well as measures that may further constrain our strategic 
flexibility. 
Resolvability and resolution and recovery planning: We have moved significant operations into subsidiaries to improve 
resolvability and meet other regulatory requirements, and this has resulted in substantial implementation costs, increased 
our capital and funding costs and reduced operational flexibility. For example, we have transferred all of our US 
subsidiaries under a US intermediate holding company to meet US regulatory requirements and have transferred 
substantially all the operations of Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management booked in Switzerland 
to UBS Switzerland AG to improve resolvability. 
These changes create operational, capital, liquidity, funding and tax inefficiencies. Our operations in subsidiaries are 
subject to local capital, liquidity, stable funding, capital planning and stress testing requirements. These requirements 
have resulted in increased capital and liquidity requirements in affected subsidiaries, which limit our operational flexibility 
and negatively affect our ability to benefit from synergies between business units and to distribute earnings to the Group.
Under the Swiss too-big-to-fail (TBTF) framework, we are required to put in place viable emergency plans to preserve the 
operation of systemically important functions in the event of a failure. Moreover, under this framework and similar 
regulations in the US, the UK, the EU and other jurisdictions in which we operate, we are required to prepare credible 
recovery and resolution plans detailing the measures that would be taken to recover in a significant adverse event or in 
the event of winding down the Group or the operations in a host country through resolution or insolvency proceedings. 
If a recovery or resolution plan that we produce is determined by the relevant authority to be inadequate or not credible, 
relevant regulation may permit the authority to place limitations on the scope or size of our business in that jurisdiction, 
or oblige us to hold higher amounts of capital or liquidity or to change our legal structure or business in order to remove 
the relevant impediments to resolution.
The authorities in Switzerland and internationally are working on lessons learned from the Credit Suisse and the US 
regional bank failures, which might result in additional requirements regarding resolution planning and early intervention 
tools for authorities.
Capital and prudential standards: As an internationally active Swiss systemically relevant bank (an SRB), we are subject to 
capital and total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements that are among the most stringent in the world. Moreover, 
many of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital, liquidity and similar requirements and, as a result, UBS 
Group AG and UBS AG have contributed a significant portion of their capital and provide substantial liquidity to these 
subsidiaries. These funds are available to meet funding and collateral needs in the relevant entities, but are generally not 
readily available for use by the Group as a whole. 
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 69
We expect our risk-weighted assets (RWA) to further increase as the effective date for additional capital standards 
promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) draws nearer. In connection with the acquisition 
of the Credit Suisse Group, FINMA has permitted Credit Suisse entities to continue to apply certain prior interpretations 
and has provided supervisory rulings on the treatment of certain items for RWA or capital purposes. In general, these 
interpretations require that UBS phase out the treatment over the next several years. In addition, FINMA has agreed that 
the additional capital requirement applicable to Swiss SRBs, which is based on market share in Switzerland and leverage 
ratio denominator (LRD), will not increase as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group before the end of 
2025. The phase-out or end of these periods will likely increase our overall capital requirements, and such increase may 
be substantial.
Increases in capital and liquidity standards could significantly curtail our ability to pursue strategic opportunities or to 
return capital to shareholders.
Market regulation and fiduciary standards: Our wealth and asset management businesses operate in an environment of 
increasing regulatory scrutiny and changing standards with respect to fiduciary and other standards of care and the focus 
on mitigating or eliminating conflicts of interest between a manager or advisor and the client, which require effective 
implementation across the global systems and processes of investment managers and other industry participants. For 
example, we have made material changes to our business processes, policies and the terms on which we interact with 
these clients in order to comply with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation Best Interest, which is 
intended to enhance and clarify the duties of brokers and investment advisers to retail customers, and the Volcker Rule, 
which limits our ability to engage in proprietary trading, as well as changes in European and Swiss market conduct 
regulation. Future changes in the regulation of our duties to customers may require us to make further changes to our 
businesses, which would result in additional expense and may adversely affect our business. We may also become subject 
to other similar regulations substantively limiting the types of activities in which we may engage or the way we conduct 
our operations.
In many instances, we provide services on a cross-border basis, and we are therefore sensitive to barriers restricting 
market access for third-country firms. In particular, efforts in the EU to harmonize the regime for third-country firms to 
access the European market may have the effect of creating new barriers that adversely affect our ability to conduct 
business in these jurisdictions from Switzerland. In addition, a number of jurisdictions are increasingly regulating crossborder activities based on determinations of equivalence of home country regulation, substituted compliance or similar 
principles of comity. A negative determination with respect to Swiss equivalence could limit our access to the market in 
those jurisdictions and may negatively influence our ability to act as a global firm. For example, the EU declined to extend 
its equivalence determination for Swiss exchanges, which lapsed as of 30 June 2019. 
UBS has experienced cross-border outflows over a number of years as a result of heightened focus by fiscal authorities 
on cross-border investment and fiscal amnesty programs, in anticipation of the implementation in Switzerland of the 
global automatic exchange of tax information, and as a result of the measures UBS has implemented in response to these 
changes. Further changes in local tax laws or regulations and their enforcement, additional cross-border tax information 
exchange regimes, national tax amnesty or enforcement programs or similar actions may affect our clients’ ability or 
willingness to do business with us and could result in additional cross-border outflows.
If we experience financial difficulties, FINMA has the power to open restructuring or liquidation proceedings or impose 
protective measures in relation to UBS Group AG, UBS AG or UBS Switzerland AG, and such proceedings or measures 
may have a material adverse effect on our shareholders and creditors
Under the Swiss Banking Act, FINMA is able to exercise broad statutory powers with respect to Swiss banks and Swiss 
parent companies of financial groups, such as UBS Group AG, UBS AG, Credit Suisse AG, UBS Switzerland AG and Credit 
Suisse (Schweiz) AG, if there is justified concern that an entity is over-indebted, has serious liquidity problems or, after 
the expiration of any relevant deadline, no longer fulfills capital adequacy requirements. Such powers include ordering 
protective measures, instituting restructuring proceedings (and exercising any Swiss resolution powers in connection 
therewith), and instituting liquidation proceedings, all of which may have a material adverse effect on shareholders and 
creditors or may prevent UBS Group AG, UBS AG, UBS Switzerland AG, Credit Suisse AG or Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG 
from paying dividends or making payments on debt obligations.
UBS would have limited ability to challenge any such protective measures, and creditors and shareholders would also 
have limited ability under Swiss law or in Swiss courts to reject them, seek their suspension, or challenge their imposition, 
including measures that require or result in the deferment of payments.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 70
If restructuring proceedings are opened with respect to UBS Group AG, UBS AG, UBS Switzerland AG, Credit Suisse AG 
or Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG, the resolution powers that FINMA may exercise include the power to: (i) transfer all or 
some of the assets, debt and other liabilities, and contracts of the entity subject to proceedings to another entity; (ii) stay 
for a maximum of two business days (a) the termination of, or the exercise of rights to terminate, netting rights, (b) rights 
to enforce or dispose of certain types of collateral or (c) rights to transfer claims, liabilities or certain collateral, under 
contracts to which the entity subject to proceedings is a party; and / or (iii) partially or fully write down the equity capital 
and regulatory capital instruments and, if such regulatory capital is fully written down, write down or convert into equity 
the other debt instruments of the entity subject to proceedings. Shareholders and creditors would have no right to reject, 
or to seek the suspension of, any restructuring plan pursuant to which such resolution powers are exercised. They would 
have only limited rights to challenge any decision to exercise resolution powers or to have that decision reviewed by a 
judicial or administrative process or otherwise.
Upon full or partial write-down of the equity and regulatory capital instruments of the entity subject to restructuring 
proceedings, the relevant shareholders and creditors would receive no payment in respect of the equity and debt that is 
written down, the write-down would be permanent, and the investors would likely not, at such time or at any time 
thereafter, receive any shares or other participation rights, or be entitled to any write-up or any other compensation in 
the event of a potential subsequent recovery of the debtor. If FINMA orders the conversion of debt of the entity subject 
to restructuring proceedings into equity, the securities received by the investors may be worth significantly less than the 
original debt and may have a significantly different risk profile. In addition, creditors receiving equity would be effectively 
subordinated to all creditors of the restructured entity in the event of a subsequent winding up, liquidation or dissolution 
of the restructured entity, which would increase the risk that investors would lose all or some of their investment. 
FINMA has significant discretion in the exercise of its powers in connection with restructuring proceedings. Furthermore, 
certain categories of debt obligations, such as certain types of deposits, are subject to preferential treatment. As a result, 
holders of obligations of an entity subject to a Swiss restructuring proceeding may have their obligations written down 
or converted into equity even though obligations ranking on par with such obligations are not written down or converted.
Developments in sustainability, climate, environmental and social standards and regulations may affect our business 
and impact our ability to fully realize our goals
We have set ambitious goals for ESG matters. These goals include our ambitions for environmental sustainability in our 
operations, including carbon emissions, in the business we do with clients and in products that we offer. They also include 
goals or aspirations for diversity in our workforce and supply chain, and support for the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals. There is substantial uncertainty as to the scope of actions that may be required of us, governments 
and others to achieve the goals we have set, and many of our goals and objectives are only achievable with a combination 
of government and private action. National and international standards and expectations, industry and scientific practices, 
regulatory taxonomies, and disclosure obligations addressing these matters are relatively immature and are rapidly 
evolving. In addition, there are significant limitations in the data available to measure our climate and other goals. 
Although we have defined and disclosed our goals based on the standards existing at the time of disclosure, there can 
be no assurance (i) that the various ESG regulatory and disclosure regimes under which we operate will not come into 
conflict with one another, (ii) that the current standards will not be interpreted differently than our understanding or 
change in a manner that substantially increases the cost or effort for us to achieve such goals or (iii) that additional data 
or methods, whether voluntary or required by regulation, may substantially change our calculation of our goals and 
ambitions. It is possible that such goals may prove to be considerably more difficult or even impossible to achieve. The 
evolving standards may also require us to substantially change the stated goals and ambitions. If we are not able to 
achieve the goals we have set, or can only do so at significant expense to our business, we may fail to meet regulatory 
expectations, incur damage to our reputation or be exposed to an increased risk of litigation or other adverse action.
While ESG regulatory regimes and international standards are being developed, including to require consideration of ESG 
risks in investment decisions, some jurisdictions, notably in the US, have developed rules restricting the consideration of 
ESG factors in investment and business decisions. Under these anti-ESG rules, companies that are perceived as boycotting 
or discriminating against certain industries may be restricted from doing business with certain governmental entities. Our 
businesses may be adversely affected if we are considered as discriminating against companies based on ESG 
considerations, or if further anti-ESG rules are developed or broadened.
Material weaknesses of Credit Suisse controls over financial reporting
In March 2023, prior to the acquisition by UBS Group AG, the Credit Suisse Group and Credit Suisse AG disclosed that 
their management had identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as a result of which, the 
Credit Suisse Group and Credit Suisse AG had concluded that, as of 31 December 2022, their internal control over 
financial reporting were not effective, and for the same reasons, reached the same conclusion regarding 31 December 
2021. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting 
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a registrant’s financial statements will not be 
prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses result in a risk that a material error may not be detected 
by Credit Suisse’s internal controls that could result in a material misstatement to Credit Suisse’s reported financial results, 
which are consolidated with UBS Group AG’s results.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 71
The material weaknesses that were identified relate to the failure to design and maintain an effective risk assessment 
process to identify and analyze the risk of material misstatements in our financial statements and the failure to design 
and maintain effective monitoring activities relating to (i) providing sufficient management oversight over the internal 
control evaluation process to support Credit Suisse internal control objectives; (ii) involving appropriate and sufficient 
management resources to support the risk assessment and monitoring objectives; and (iii) assessing and communicating 
the severity of deficiencies in a timely manner to those parties responsible for taking corrective action. These material 
weaknesses contributed to an additional material weakness, as the Credit Suisse Group management did not design and 
maintain effective controls over the classification and presentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows under US 
GAAP.
Credit Suisse subsequently started a remediation program to address the identified material weaknesses and has 
implemented additional controls and procedures Based on the work completed to date, Credit Suisse management has 
assessed that the changes to internal control made to address the material weakness relating to the classification and 
presentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows are effective in design, but that additional time is required to 
conclude that these controls and processes are operating effectively on a sustainable basis. The remaining material 
weaknesses at Credit Suisse relate to the risk and severity assessment of internal controls. Credit Suisse has implemented 
an enhanced severity assessment framework and additional management oversight of severity assessments. UBS has 
determined to remediate the internal control risk identification weakness by integrating Credit Suisse into the UBS internal 
control risk assessment and evaluation framework in 2024. The operating effectiveness of the of both the risk and severity 
assessment processes will be assessed based on an evaluation of the 2024 risk assessment and control testing process. 
In light of the above, Credit Suisse management has concluded that these material weaknesses were not fully remediated 
at 31 December 2023. 
In addition, since the acquisition, UBS has commenced a review of the processes and systems giving rise to the material 
weaknesses and the remediation program undertaken. This review is ongoing, and UBS and Credit Suisse expect to adopt 
and implement further controls and procedures following the completion of the review. In the course of this review, UBS 
and Credit Suisse may become aware of facts that cause UBS to broaden the scope of the review.
UBS Group AG management and UBS AG management have assessed that, as of 31 December 2023, UBS’s internal 
control over financial reporting was effective. Under guidance published by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude 
the processes and controls certain acquired businesses from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
during the year of acquisition. Accordingly, UBS Group AG has excluded Credit Suisse entities, from UBS Group AG and 
UBS AG management’s assessments of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023.
Our financial results may be negatively affected by changes to assumptions and valuations, as well as changes to 
accounting standards
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. The application of 
these accounting standards requires the use of judgment based on estimates and assumptions that may involve significant 
uncertainty at the time they are made. This is the case, for example, with respect to the measurement of fair value of 
financial instruments, the recognition of deferred tax assets (DTAs), the assessment of the impairment of goodwill, 
expected credit losses and estimation of provisions for litigation, regulatory and similar matters. Such judgments, 
including the underlying estimates and assumptions, which encompass historical experience, expectations of the future 
and other factors, are regularly evaluated to determine their continuing relevance based on current conditions. Using 
different assumptions could cause the reported results to differ. Changes in assumptions, or failure to make the changes 
necessary to reflect evolving market conditions, may have a significant effect on the financial statements in the periods 
when changes occur. Estimates of provisions may be subject to a wide range of potential outcomes and significant 
uncertainty. For example, the broad range of potential outcomes in our legal proceedings in France and in a number of 
Credit Suisse’s legal proceedings increase the uncertainty associated with assessing the appropriate provision. If the 
estimates and assumptions in future periods deviate from the current outlook, our financial results may also be negatively 
affected. 
Changes to IFRS Accounting Standards or interpretations thereof may cause future reported results and financial positions 
to differ from current expectations, or historical results to differ from those previously reported due to the adoption of 
accounting standards on a retrospective basis. Such changes may also affect our regulatory capital and ratios. For 
example, the introduction of the ECL regime under IFRS 9 in 2018 fundamentally changed how credit risk arising from 
loans, loan commitments, guarantees and certain revocable facilities is accounted for. Under the ECL regime, credit loss 
expenses may increase rapidly at the onset of an economic downturn as a result of higher levels of credit impairments 
(stage 3), as well as higher ECL from stages 1 and 2, only gradually diminishing once the economic outlook improves. As 
we observed in 2020, this effect may be more pronounced in a deteriorating economic environment. Substantial increases 
in ECL could exceed expected loss for regulatory capital purposes and adversely affect our CET1 capital and regulatory 
capital ratios. 
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 72
We may be unable to maintain our capital strength
Capital strength enables us to grow our businesses and absorb increases in regulatory and capital requirements. Our 
ability to maintain our capital ratios is subject to numerous risks, including the financial results of our businesses, the 
effect of changes to capital standards, methodologies and interpretations that may adversely affect the calculation of our 
capital ratios, the imposition of risk add-ons or capital buffers, and the application of additional capital, liquidity and 
similar requirements to subsidiaries. Our capital and leverage ratios are driven primarily by RWA, LRD and eligible capital, 
all of which may fluctuate based on a number of factors, some of which are outside of our control. The results of our 
businesses may be adversely affected by events arising from other risk factors described herein. In some cases, such as 
litigation and regulatory risk and operational risk events, losses may be sudden and large. These risks could reduce the 
amount of capital available for return to shareholders and hinder our ability to achieve our capital returns target of a 
progressive cash dividend coupled with a share repurchase program.
Our eligible capital may be reduced by losses recognized within net profit or other comprehensive income. Eligible capital 
may also be reduced for other reasons, including acquisitions that change the level of goodwill, changes in temporary 
differences related to DTAs included in capital, adverse currency movements affecting the value of equity, prudential 
adjustments that may be required due to the valuation uncertainty associated with certain types of positions, changes in 
regulatory interpretations on the inclusion or exclusion of items contributing to our shareholders’ equity in regulatory 
capital, and changes in the value of certain pension fund assets and liabilities or in the interest rate and other assumptions 
used to calculate the changes in our net defined benefit obligation recognized in other comprehensive income.
RWA are driven by our business activities, by changes in the risk profile of our exposures, by changes in our foreign 
currency exposures and foreign exchange rates, and by regulation. For instance, substantial market volatility, a widening 
of credit spreads, adverse currency movements, increased counterparty risk, deterioration in the economic environment 
or increased operational risk could result in an increase in RWA. Changes in the calculation of RWA, the imposition of 
additional supplemental RWA charges or multipliers applied to certain exposures and other methodology changes, as 
well as the finalization of the Basel III framework and Fundamental Review of the Trading Book promulgated by the 
BCBS, which are expected to increase our RWA.
The leverage ratio is a balance sheet-driven measure and therefore limits balance sheet-intensive activities, such as 
lending, more than activities that are less balance sheet intensive, and it may constrain our business even if we satisfy 
other risk-based capital requirements. Our LRD is driven by, among other things, the level of client activity, including 
deposits and loans, foreign exchange rates, interest rates, other market factors and changes in required liquidity. Many 
of these factors are wholly or partly outside of our control.
The effect of taxes on our financial results is significantly influenced by tax law changes and reassessments of our 
deferred tax assets and, also, operating losses of certain entities with no associated tax benefit
Our effective tax rate is highly sensitive to our performance, our expectation of future profitability and any potential 
increases or decreases in statutory tax rates, such as any potential increase or decrease in the US federal corporate tax 
rate. Furthermore, based on prior years’ tax losses and deductible temporary differences, we have recognized DTAs 
reflecting the probable recoverable level based on future taxable profit as informed by our business plans. If our 
performance is expected to produce diminished taxable profit in future years, particularly in the US, we may be required 
to write down all or a portion of the currently recognized DTAs through the income statement in excess of anticipated 
amortization. This would have the effect of increasing our effective tax rate in the year in which any write-downs are 
taken. Conversely, if we expect the performance of entities in which we have unrecognized tax losses to improve, 
particularly in the US or the UK, we could potentially recognize additional DTAs. The effect of doing so would be to 
reduce our effective tax rate in years in which additional DTAs are recognized and to increase our effective tax rate in 
future years. Our effective tax rate is also sensitive to any future reductions in statutory tax rates, particularly in the US, 
which would cause the expected future tax benefit from items such as tax loss carry-forwards in the affected locations 
to diminish in value. This, in turn, would cause a write-down of the associated DTAs. Conversely, an increase in US 
corporate tax rates would result in an increase in the Group’s DTAs.
We generally revalue our DTAs in the fourth quarter of the financial year based on a reassessment of future profitability 
taking into account our updated business plans. We consider the performance of our businesses and the accuracy of 
historical forecasts, tax rates and other factors in evaluating the recoverability of our DTAs, including the remaining tax 
loss carry-forward period and our assessment of expected future taxable profits over the life of DTAs. Estimating future 
profitability is inherently subjective and is particularly sensitive to future economic, market and other conditions, which 
are difficult to predict. 
Our results in past years have demonstrated that changes in the recognition of DTAs can have a very significant effect 
on our reported results. Any future change in the manner in which UBS remeasures DTAs could affect UBS’s effective tax 
rate, particularly in the year in which the change is made.
Annual Report 2023 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Risk factors 73
Our full-year effective tax rate would be impacted if aggregate tax expenses in respect of profits from branches and 
subsidiaries without loss coverage differ from what is expected or if certain branches and subsidiaries incur operating 
losses that we cannot benefit from through the income statement. In particular, operating losses at entities or branches 
that cannot offset for tax purposes taxable profits in other Group entities, and which do not result in additional DTA 
recognition, would increase our effective tax rate. In addition, tax laws or the tax authorities in countries where we have 
undertaken legal structure changes may cause entities to be subject to taxation as permanent establishments or may 
prevent the transfer of tax losses incurred in one legal entity to newly organized or reorganized subsidiaries or affiliates 
or may impose limitations on the utilization of tax losses that relate to businesses formerly conducted by the transferor. 
Were this to occur in situations where there were also limited planning opportunities to utilize the tax losses in the 
originating entity, the DTAs associated with such tax losses may be required to be written down through the income 
statement.
Changes in tax law may materially affect our effective tax rate and, in some cases, may substantially affect the profitability 
of certain activities. In addition, statutory and regulatory changes, as well as changes to the way in which courts and tax 
authorities interpret tax laws, including assertions that we are required to pay taxes in a jurisdiction as a result of activities 
connected to that jurisdiction constituting a permanent establishment or similar theory, and changes in our assessment 
of uncertain tax positions, could cause the amount of taxes we ultimately pay to materially differ from the amount 
accrued.
We may incur material future tax liabilities in connection with the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group
In the past, the Credit Suisse Group has recorded significant impairments of the tax value of its participations in 
subsidiaries below their tax acquisition costs. As a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, tax acquisition 
costs of participations held by Credit Suisse Group AG and its subsidiaries have been transferred to the UBS Group. UBS 
Group AG and its subsidiaries may become subject to additional Swiss tax on future reversals of such impairments for 
Swiss tax purposes. Reversals of prior impairments may occur to the extent that the net asset value of the previously 
impaired subsidiary increases, e.g., as a result of an increase in retained earnings. Although it is difficult to quantify this 
additional future tax exposure, as various potential mitigants (e.g., transfers of assets and liabilities, business activities, 
subsidiary investments, as well as other restructuring measures within the combined Group in the course of the 
integration) exist, it may be material.
Liquidity and funding risk
Liquidity and funding management are critical to UBS’s ongoing performance 
The viability of our business depends on the availability of funding sources, and our success depends on our ability to 
obtain funding at times, in amounts, for tenors and at rates that enable us to efficiently support our asset base in all 
market conditions. Our funding sources have generally been stable, but could change in the future because of, among 
other things, general market disruptions or widening credit spreads, which could also influence the cost of funding. A 
substantial part of our liquidity and funding requirements are met using short-term unsecured funding sources, including 
retail and wholesale deposits and the regular issuance of money market securities. A change in the availability of shortterm funding could occur quickly.
The addition of loss-absorbing debt as a component of capital requirements, the regulatory requirements to maintain 
minimum TLAC at UBS’s holding company and at certain of its subsidiaries, as well as the power of resolution authorities 
to bail in TLAC instruments and other debt obligations, and uncertainty as to how such powers will be exercised, caused 
and may still cause a further increase in UBS’s cost of funding, and could potentially increase the total amount of funding 
required, in the absence of other changes in its business.
Reductions in our credit ratings may adversely affect the market value of the securities and other obligations and increase 
our funding costs, in particular with regard to funding from wholesale unsecured sources, and could affect the availability 
of certain kinds of funding. In addition, as experienced in connection with the Moody’s Investors Service Ltd. downgrade 
of UBS AG’s long-term debt rating in June 2012, rating downgrades can require us to post additional collateral or make 
additional cash payments under trading agreements. Our credit ratings, together with our capital strength and 
reputation, also contribute to maintaining client and counterparty confidence, and it is possible that rating changes could 
influence the performance of some of our businesses. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has elevated these risks 
and may cause these risks to intensify. Upon the close of the acquisition in June 2023, Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited 
downgraded the Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of UBS Group AG to “A” from “A+” and of UBS AG to “A+” 
from “AA–“. Fitch Ratings Ltd. also upgraded Credit Suisse AG’s Long-Term IDR to “A+” from “BBB+”.
The requirement to maintain a liquidity coverage ratio of high-quality liquid assets to estimated stressed short-term net cash 
outflows, and other similar liquidity and funding requirements, oblige us to maintain high levels of overall liquidity, limit our 
ability to optimize interest income and expense, make certain lines of business less attractive and reduce our overall ability 
to generate profits. The liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements are intended to ensure that we 
are not overly reliant on short-term funding and that we have sufficient long-term funding for illiquid assets. The relevant 
calculations make assumptions about the relative likelihood and amount of outflows of funding and available sources of 
additional funding in market-wide and firm-specific stress situations. In an actual stress situation, however, our funding 
outflows could exceed the assumed amounts. Further, UBS is subject to increased liquidity requirements related to too-bigto-fail (TBTF) measures under the direction of FINMA, which became effective on 1 January 2024.

Critical accounting estimates and judgments
In preparing our financial statements in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, as issued by the International 
Accounting Standards Board (the IASB), we apply judgment and make estimates and assumptions that may involve 
significant uncertainty at the time they are made. We regularly reassess those estimates and assumptions, which 
encompass historical experience, expectations of the future and other pertinent factors, to determine their continuing 
relevance based on current conditions, and update them as necessary. Changes in estimates and assumptions may have 
significant effects on the financial statements. Furthermore, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates, 
which could result in significant losses to the Group, beyond what we expected or provided for. 
Key areas involving a high degree of judgment and areas where estimates and assumptions are significant to the 
consolidated financial statements include the following (note references below are found in the “Consolidated financial 
statements” section of this report):
– provisional amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of the 
Credit Suisse Group (refer to “Note 2 Accounting for the acquisition of Credit Suisse Group”);
– expected credit loss measurement (refer to “Note 20 Expected credit loss measurement”);
– fair value measurement (refer to “Note 21 Fair value measurement”);
– income taxes (refer to “Note 9 Income taxes”);
– provisions and contingent liabilities (refer to “Note 18 Provisions and contingent liabilities”);
– post-employment benefit plans (refer to “Note 27 Post-employment benefit plans”);
– goodwill (refer to Note 13 Goodwill and intangible assets”); and 
– consolidation of structured entities (refer to “Note 29 Interests in subsidiaries and other entities”).

Adjustment made within the IFRS 3 measurement period after publication of the fourth quarter 2023 report
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in the second quarter of 2023 resulted in provisional negative goodwill of 
USD 28.9bn. Following the publication of the unaudited fourth quarter 2023 report on 6 February 2024, UBS has refined 
its acquisition-date fair value estimates in accordance with the 12-month measurement period requirements provided by 
IFRS 3, Business combinations. This has resulted in an adjustment of USD 1.2bn, decreasing the negative goodwill to 
USD 27.7bn. As a result, 2023 operating profit before tax and 2023 net profit attributable to shareholders decreased by 
USD 1.2bn, basic earnings per share decreased by USD 0.38 to USD 8.83 and diluted earnings per share decreased by 
USD 0.36 to USD 8.45. In addition, the CET1 capital ratio decreased to 14.4% from 14.5%.

Non-adjusting post balance sheet event 
In March 2024, we have entered into agreements with entities and funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global 
Management (collectively, Apollo) and Atlas SP Partners (Atlas) to conclude the investment management agreement 
under which Atlas has managed Credit Suisse’s retained portfolio of assets of its former securitized products group 
(SPG). Following this agreement, the assets previously managed by Atlas will be managed in Non-core and Legacy. The 
parties have also agreed to conclude the transition services agreement under which Credit Suisse has provided services 
to Atlas. In addition, Credit Suisse AG has entered into an agreement to transfer to Apollo approximately USD 8bn of 
senior secured asset-based financing. As part of the loan transfer, Credit Suisse AG will extend a one-year USD 750m 
swingline facility to the borrowers under the transferred financing facilities. In UBS Group, we expect to recognize a net 
gain in the first quarter of 2024 of around USD 0.3bn and Credit Suisse AG is expected to recognize a net loss of around 
USD 0.9bn from the conclusion of the investment management agreement and assignment of the loan facilities. The 
differences reflect adjustments UBS Group made under IFRS as part of the purchase price allocation at the closing of the 
acquisition of Credit Suisse Group, as well as provisions in the second and third quarter of 2023 that are not recognized 
under Credit Suisse AG’s US GAAP accounting policies.

2023 compared with 2022
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group had a significant impact on the results for 2023, including the recognition of 
negative goodwill, impacts from accretion of purchase price allocation (PPA) adjustments on financial instruments, and 
integration-related costs. As the integration of the UBS and Credit Suisse businesses continues, from the third quarter of 
2023 onward, a new business division, Non-core and Legacy, became a reportable segment containing assets and 
liabilities that have been assessed as not strategic in light of the acquisition.

Underlying results
In addition to reporting our results in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, we report underlying results that 
exclude items of profit or loss that management believes are not representative of the underlying performance.
In 2023, underlying revenues exclude accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments measured at amortized cost, 
including off-balance sheet positions and other related effects, arising from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. 
Accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments is accelerated when the related financial instrument is terminated 
or disposed of before its contractual maturity. No adjustment is made for accretion of PPA adjustments on financial 
instruments within the Non-core and Legacy due to the nature of the business model. Underlying revenues also exclude 
losses relating to our investment in SIX Group.
Underlying expenses exclude integration-related expenses that are temporary, incremental and directly related to the 
integration of Credit Suisse into UBS, including costs of internal staff and contractors substantially dedicated to 
integration activities, retention awards, redundancy costs, incremental expenses from the shortening of useful lives of 
property, equipment and software, and impairment charges relating to these assets. Classification as integration-related 
expenses does not affect the timing of recognition and measurement of those expenses or the presentation thereof in 
the income statement. Integration-related expenses incurred by Credit Suisse also included expenses associated with 
restructuring programs that existed prior to the acquisition.
Acquisition-related costs consist of costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group and mainly 
include consulting and legal fees.
Results
In 2023, reported net profit attributable to shareholders increased by USD 20,219m to USD 27,849m, which included 
negative goodwill of USD 27,748m relating to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group and a net tax expense of 
USD 873m. 
Operating profit before tax increased by USD 19,135m to USD 28,739m, primarily reflecting negative goodwill and an 
increase in total revenues, partly offset by higher operating expenses and net credit loss expenses. Operating expenses 
increased by USD 13,876m, or 56%, to USD 38,806m, largely due to the consolidation of Credit Suisse expenses of 
USD 10,598m, and included integration-related expenses of USD 4,478m. This increase was mainly driven by a 
USD 7,219m increase in personnel expenses and a USD 4,967m increase in general and administrative expenses. 
Depreciation, amortization and impairment of non-financial assets increased by USD 1,689m. Net credit loss expenses 
were USD 1,037m, compared with USD 29m in 2022. Total revenues increased by USD 6,271m, or 18%, to 
USD 40,834m, driven by the consolidation of Credit Suisse revenues of USD 7,566m, and included USD 2,280m of 
accretion resulting from PPA adjustments on financial instruments and other effects. Total combined net interest income 
and other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss increased by USD 4,743m 
and net fee and commission income increased by USD 2,604m. These increases were partly offset by a USD 1,075m 
decrease in other income, largely attributable to the prior year including a gain of USD 848m in Asset Management on 
the sale of our shareholding in our Japanese real estate joint venture, Mitsubishi Corp.-UBS Realty Inc.
Underlying results 2023 vs 2022
For 2023, underlying results exclude negative goodwill of USD 27,748m, USD 2,280m of accretion impacts resulting 
from PPA adjustments on financial instruments and other effects, as well as losses of USD 508m from our investment in 
SIX Group. We have also excluded from operating expenses integration-related expenses of USD 4,478m, acquisitionrelated costs of USD 202m and USD 65m of amortization from newly recognized intangibles resulting from the 
acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
On an underlying basis, profit before tax decreased by USD 4,537m, or 53%, to USD 3,963m, reflecting a USD 9,131m 
increase in underlying operating expenses and an increase in net credit loss expenses of USD 1,008m, partly offset by a 
USD 5,603m increase in underlying total revenues.

Total revenues
Net interest income and other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss
Total combined net interest income and other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through 
profit or loss increased by USD 4,743m to USD 18,880m, mainly driven by the consolidation of USD 4,302m of Credit 
Suisse revenues, and included USD 1,533m of accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments and other effects.
Personal & Corporate Banking increased by USD 3,381m to USD 6,066m, largely attributable to the consolidation of 
USD 2,451m of Credit Suisse revenues, and included USD 917m of accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments 
and other effects. The remaining increase was mainly driven by higher deposit margins, which resulted from higher 
interest rates, and higher loan revenues, partly offset by lower deposit fees. 2022 included a benefit from the Swiss 
National Bank deposit exemption. Excluding accretion effects, underlying net interest income was USD 4,387m.
Global Wealth Management increased by USD 1,969m to USD 8,324m, largely attributable to the consolidation of 
USD 1,718m of Credit Suisse revenues, and included USD 671m of accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments 
and other effects. The remaining increase was mainly driven by higher deposit margins, resulting from higher interest 
rates, partly offset by the effects of shifts to lower-margin deposit products. Excluding accretion effects, underlying net 
interest income was USD 6,294m.
Non-core and Legacy increased by USD 273m to USD 391m, mainly due to the transfer of assets and liabilities into Noncore and Legacy following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Revenues included net gains from position marks 
and unwinds, along with net carry from securitized products and credit products.
Investment Bank decreased by USD 734m to USD 5,035m, despite the consolidation of USD 34m of Credit Suisse 
revenues. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower revenues in the Derivatives & Solutions business, mostly driven 
by Equity Derivatives, Rates and Foreign Exchange, due to lower levels of both volatility and client activity. This was partly 
offset by an increase in Financing, reflecting higher client balances.

information is provided at the business line level rather than by financial statement reporting line in order to reflect the underlying business activities, which is consistent with the structure of the management discussion

Net fee and commission income
Net fee and commission income increased by USD 2,604m to USD 21,570m and included USD 747m of accretion of PPA 
adjustments on financial instruments, which was included in other fee and commission income, mainly in the Investment 
Bank.
Fees for portfolio management and related services increased by USD 1,614m to USD 10,673m, largely due to the 
consolidation of USD 1,583m of Credit Suisse revenues.
Excluding the consolidation of Credit Suisse revenues, investment fund fees decreased by USD 212m, driven by Global 
Wealth Management and Asset Management, mainly reflecting negative market performance.
Excluding the consolidation of Credit Suisse revenues, net brokerage fees decreased by USD 204m, driven by lower levels 
of client activity in Global Wealth Management and lower market volumes of cash equities in Execution Services in the 
Investment Bank.

Annual Report 2023 | Financial and operating performance | Group performance 79
Other income
Other income decreased by USD 1,075m to USD 384m, largely due to a USD 380m decrease in share of net profits from 
associates and joint ventures, which included USD 508m losses relating to our investment in SIX Group, partly offset by 
higher recognition of recurring share of net profits. These losses reflected UBS’s share of impairments taken by SIX Group 
on its investment in Worldline and on goodwill related to its Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME) subsidiary. This was 
partly offset by USD 174m of mortgage servicing rights fees, attributable to the consolidation of Credit Suisse revenues, 
as well as a USD 62m increase in gains recognized on repurchases of UBS’s own debt instruments. In contrast, in 2022, 
other income included gains from disposals of associates and subsidiaries, including a gain of USD 848m in Asset 
Management on the sale of our shareholding in our Japanese real estate joint venture, Mitsubishi Corp.-UBS Realty Inc., 
gains in Global Wealth Management of USD 133m on the sale of our domestic wealth management business in Spain, 
USD 86m on the sale of UBS Swiss Financial Advisers AG and USD 41m on the sale of our US alternative investments 
administration business.

Credit loss expense / release
Total net credit loss expenses were USD 1,037m in 2023, reflecting net credit loss expenses of USD 593m related to 
stage 1 and 2 positions and net credit loss expenses of USD 445m related to credit-impaired (stage 3 and purchased 
credit-impaired) positions. Expected credit loss (ECL) expenses of USD 593m for the performing loans were predominantly 
attributable to the initial recognition of ECL allowances and provisions after the date of the acquisition of the Credit 
Suisse Group. Credit-impaired net expenses amounted to USD 445m, of which USD 325m was within the Credit Suisse 
portfolio and USD 120m was within the UBS portfolio. As per IFRS 9, no ECL allowances and provisions had to be 
recognized on the acquisition date for credit-impaired exposures, after the fair valuation as per the PPA.

Operating expenses
Personnel expenses
Personnel expenses increased by USD 7,219m to USD 24,899m, mainly due to the consolidation of Credit Suisse expenses 
of USD 6,330m, and included integration-related expenses of USD 2,192m covering post-employment benefit plans, 
awards granted to employees to support retention and operational stability, severance expenses, and the alignment of 
Credit Suisse processes to the UBS variable compensation framework. Salaries and variable compensation increased by 
USD 5,843m due to the aforementioned effects and also salary adjustments, higher variable compensation, and foreign 
currency effects. Social security costs also increased by USD 529m. Pension and other post-employment benefit plans 
increased by USD 567m as a result of the aforementioned factors and included an increase in the pension plan obligation 
of the Swiss pension plan of Credit Suisse following the decision to align that Swiss pension plan to UBS’s Swiss pension 
plan, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of USD 245m (CHF 207m) in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an offsetting gain in 
other comprehensive income due to the asset ceiling.
› Refer to the “Compensation” section of this report for more information
› Refer to “Note 7 Personnel expenses,” “Note 27 Post-employment benefit plans” and “Note 28 Employee benefits: variable 
compensation” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report for more information
General and administrative expenses
General and administrative expenses increased by USD 4,967m to USD 10,156m, largely due to the consolidation of 
Credit Suisse expenses of USD 3,000m, and included total integration-related expenses of USD 1,436m, mainly from 
higher consulting and real estate costs, as well as acquisition-related costs of USD 202m, also mainly related to consulting 
fees. Excluding the aforementioned effects, general and administrative expenses increased by USD 1,050m, mainly due 
to a USD 665m increase in provisions related to the US residential mortgage-backed securities litigation matter, as well 
as an increase in technology costs of USD 190m.
We believe that the industry continues to operate in an environment in which expenses associated with litigation, 
regulatory and similar matters will remain elevated for the foreseeable future, and we continue to be exposed to a 
number of significant claims and regulatory matters. The outcome of many of these matters, the timing of a resolution, 
and the potential effects of resolutions on our future business, financial results or financial condition are extremely 
difficult to predict.
› Refer to “Note 8 General and administrative expenses” and “Note 18 Provisions and contingent liabilities” in the “Consolidated 
financial statements” section of this report for more information
Depreciation, amortization and impairment of non-financial assets
Depreciation, amortization and impairment of non-financial assets increased by USD 1,689m to USD 3,750m, largely due 
to the consolidation of Credit Suisse expenses of USD 1,268m, and included total integration-related expenses of 
USD 850m, mainly attributable to impairment and accelerated depreciation of right-of-use assets associated with real 
estate leases, as well as a USD 206m impairment of software projects in progress resulting from a reprioritization of 
software development activity in the context of the acquisition. Excluding the aforementioned effects, depreciation, 
amortization and impairment of non-financial assets increased by USD 146m, mainly due to higher depreciation of 
internally developed software, reflecting a higher level of capitalized costs.

Tax
Income tax expenses of USD 873m were recognized for the Group in 2023, representing an effective tax rate of 3.0%, 
compared with USD 1,942m for 2022, which represented an effective tax rate of 20.2%. The income tax expenses for 
2023 included Swiss tax expenses of USD 1,035m and a non-Swiss net tax benefit of USD 162m.
The Swiss tax expenses included current tax expenses of USD 883m in respect of taxable profits of UBS Switzerland AG 
and other Swiss entities and deferred tax expenses of USD 152m that primarily related to the amortization of deferred 
tax assets (DTAs), as deductions related to temporary differences were made against profits.
Annual Report 2023 | Financial and operating performance | Group performance 81
The non-Swiss net tax benefit included current tax expenses of USD 684m that related to expenses of USD 100m in 
respect of US corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) and USD 584m in respect of other taxable profits of non-Swiss 
subsidiaries and branches. However, these were more than offset by a net deferred tax benefit of USD 846m that primarily 
related to a benefit of USD 754m in respect of remeasurements of DTAs, which included USD 480m in respect of net 
upward revaluations of DTAs for certain entities in connection with the Group’s business planning process and USD 274m 
in respect of an increase in DTAs that resulted from an increase in the expected value of future tax deductions for deferred 
compensation awards due to an increase in the Group’s share price during the year. In addition, the net deferred tax 
benefit included a benefit of USD 100m in respect of the recognition of DTAs for tax credits carried forward in respect 
of CAMT, which was partly offset by a net deferred tax expense of USD 8m.
The low effective tax rate for the year of 3.0% primarily reflects that the negative goodwill gain that was recorded in the 
income statement did not result in any tax expense, as well as the aforementioned tax benefit of USD 754m in respect 
of the remeasurement of DTAs. However, these benefits were partly offset by the impact of operating losses that were 
incurred by certain entities, reflecting integration-related expenses and restructuring costs, that did not result in any tax 
benefits because they cannot be offset with profits of other group entities and they did not result in any DTA recognition. 
If further such operating losses are incurred in 2024, the Group’s tax expense for the year may be significantly higher 
than the Group’s structural rate of 23% but, the Group’s effective tax rate is expected to decrease towards the structural 
rate in subsequent years, as such losses decrease.

Total comprehensive income attributable to shareholders
In 2023, total comprehensive income attributable to shareholders was USD 28,836m, reflecting net profit of 
USD 27,849m, which included the recognition of negative goodwill on the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group of 
USD 27,748m, and other comprehensive income (OCI), net of tax, of USD 986m.
Foreign currency translation OCI was USD 1,456m, mainly due to the significant strengthening of the Swiss franc (10%) 
and the euro (3%) against the US dollar.
OCI related to cash flow hedges was USD 1,275m, mainly reflecting net losses on hedging instruments that were 
reclassified from OCI to the income statement.
Defined benefit plan OCI, net of tax, was positive USD 40m. Total net pre-tax OCI related to the Credit Suisse Swiss 
pension plan was positive USD 217m. This reflected losses of USD 1,161m from the defined benefit obligation (DBO) 
remeasurement, more than offset by an increase in the plan assets of USD 443m and a decrease in the effect of the asset 
ceiling under IFRS Accounting Standards of USD 935m. These changes include an increase in the pension plan obligation 
of the Swiss pension plan of Credit Suisse following the decision to align the Swiss pension scheme to that of UBS, which 
resulted in a pre-tax loss of USD 245m (CHF 207m) in the fourth quarter of 2023 and an offsetting gain in OCI due to 
the asset ceiling. Total pre-tax OCI related to the UBS Swiss pension plan was negative USD 93m, reflecting losses of 
USD 3,285m from the DBO remeasurement, almost entirely offset by an increase in the plan assets of USD 791m and a 
decrease in the effect of the asset ceiling under IFRS Accounting Standards of USD 2,401m. The DBO remeasurement 
loss of USD 3,285m was mainly driven by a loss of USD 2,358m due to a decrease in the applicable discount rate and an 
experience loss of USD 1,140m, reflecting the effects of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and 
what actually occurred. These losses were partly offset by gains of USD 366m resulting from a decrease in the expected 
rate of interest credit on retirement savings.
Total pre-tax OCI related to our non-Swiss pension plans was negative USD 15m, mostly driven by the UK and German 
pension plans, which recorded negative net pre-tax OCI of USD 41m and USD 16m, respectively, partly offset by the US 
pension plans, which had a positive OCI of USD 45m, and the remaining pension plans. 
OCI related to own credit on financial liabilities designated at fair value was negative USD 1,769m, primarily due to a 
tightening of our own credit spreads.

Annual Report 2023 | Financial and operating performance | Group performance 82
Sensitivity to interest rate movements
As of 31 December 2023, we estimated that a parallel shift in yield curves by +100 basis points could lead to a combined 
increase in annual net interest income from our banking book of approximately USD 1.8bn in the first year after such a 
shift. Of this increase, approximately USD 1.1bn, USD 0.4bn and USD 0.1bn would result from changes in Swiss franc, 
US dollar and euro interest rates, respectively. A parallel shift in yield curves by –100 basis points could lead to a combined 
decrease in annual net interest income of approximately USD 1.9bn in the first year after such a shift, showing similar 
currency contributions as for the aforementioned increase in rates.
These estimates are based on a hypothetical scenario of an immediate change in interest rates, equal across all currencies 
and relative to implied forward rates as of 31 December 2023 applied to our banking book. These estimates further 
assume no change to balance sheet size and product mix, stable foreign exchange rates, and no specific management 
action. These estimates do not represent a forecast of net interest income variability.
Seasonal characteristics
Our revenues may show seasonal patterns, notably in the Investment Bank and transaction-based revenues for Global 
Wealth Management, and typically reflect the highest client activity levels in the first quarter, with lower levels throughout 
the rest of the year, especially during the summer months and the end-of-year holiday season. 
Key figures 
Below we provide an overview of selected key figures of the Group. For further information about key figures related to 
capital management, refer to the “Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet” section of this report.
Cost / income ratio
The cost / income ratio was 95.0%, compared with 72.1%, mainly reflecting an increase in operating expenses, partly 
offset by an increase in total revenues. The operating loss incurred by Credit Suisse entities is reflected in the overall 
increase of the ratio for the UBS Group. On an underlying basis, the cost / income ratio was 87.2%, compared with 
74.5%, mainly reflecting an increase in operating expenses on an underlying basis, partly offset by an increase in total 
revenues on an underlying basis.
Return on common equity tier 1 capital
The annualized return on our common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital was 42.3%, compared with 17.0%, reflecting a 
USD 20,219m increase in net profit attributable to shareholders, with a partly offsetting effect driven by a USD 20.9bn 
increase in average CET1 capital. On an underlying basis, the return on CET1 capital was 4.2%, compared with 14.6%.
CET1 capital
CET1 capital increased by USD 33.0bn to USD 78.5bn as of 31 December 2023, predominantly due to an operating profit 
before tax (excluding negative goodwill) of USD 1.0bn, the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, which resulted in an 
increase of USD 34.9bn as of the acquisition date (including transitional CET1 PPA adjustments of USD 5.0bn, net of tax), 
an increase in eligible DTAs on temporary differences of USD 1.9bn and positive effects from foreign currency translation 
of USD 1.5bn, partly offset by dividend accruals of USD 2.2bn, current tax expenses of USD 1.6bn, share repurchases of 
USD 1.3bn under our share repurchase programs, amortization of transitional CET1 PPA adjustments (interest rate and 
own credit) of USD 0.7bn (net of tax), and an increase in compensation- and own share-related capital components of 
USD 0.3bn.
Risk-weighted assets
Risk-weighted assets (RWA) increased by USD 226.9bn to USD 546.5bn, primarily due to a USD 237.7bn increase 
resulting from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Excluding that acquisition, RWA decreased by USD 10.8bn, 
primarily driven by decreases of USD 19.0bn due to asset size and other movements and USD 3.7bn due to model updates 
and methodology changes, partly offset by an increase of USD 11.8bn due to currency effects.
CET1 capital ratio
Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 14.4% from 14.2%, reflecting the aforementioned increase in CET1 capital, partly 
offset by a USD 226.9bn increase in RWA.
Annual Report 2023 | Financial and operating performance | Group performance 83
Leverage ratio denominator
During 2023, the leverage ratio denominator (LRD) increased by USD 666.9bn to USD 1,695.4bn, primarily due to a 
USD 644.4bn increase resulting from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Excluding that acquisition, the LRD 
increased by USD 53.8bn due to currency effects, partly offset by USD 31.3bn due to asset size and other movements.
CET1 leverage ratio
Our CET1 leverage ratio increased to 4.6% from 4.4%, due to the aforementioned increase in CET1 capital, partly offset 
by the USD 666.9bn increase in the LRD.

We started to report fee-generating assets and net new fee-generating assets on a consolidated basis, including Credit Suisse data, from the fourth quarter of 2023 onward. 3 Relates to licensed professionals with 
the ability to provide investment advice to clients in the Americas. Consists of cash and deferred compensation awards and is based on compensable revenues and firm tenure using a formulaic approach. It also 
includes expenses related to compensation commitments with financial advisors entered into at the time of recruitment that are subject to vesting requirements. Recruitment loans to financial advisors were USD 1,754m 
as of 31 December 2023. 4 Loans and Customer deposits in this table include customer brokerage receivables and payables, respectively, which are presented in a separate reporting line on the balance sheet.

2023 compared with 2022
Results
Profit before tax decreased by USD 1,388m, or 28%, to USD 3,589m, mainly due to higher operating expenses, largely 
driven by the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, partly offset by higher total revenues. The prior year included a 
USD 133m gain from the sale of our domestic wealth management business in Spain, an USD 86m gain from the sale of 
UBS Swiss Financial Advisers AG and a USD 41m gain from the sale of our US alternative investments administration 
business. Underlying profit before tax was USD 4,048m, after excluding USD 719m of accretion of purchase price 
allocation (PPA) adjustments on financial instruments and other effects, losses of USD 190m related to our investment in 
SIX Group and integration-related expenses of USD 988m. 
Annual Report 2023 | Financial and operating performance | Global Wealth Management 85
Total revenues
Total revenues increased by USD 2,223m, or 12%, to USD 21,190m, largely driven by the consolidation of Credit Suisse 
revenues, and included the aforementioned USD 719m of accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments and 
other effects. The increase was partly offset by the aforementioned losses of USD 190m, as well as the aforementioned 
gains from the sales in 2022. Excluding accretion effects and the aforementioned losses, underlying total revenues were 
USD 20,661m.
Net interest income increased by USD 1,692m, or 32%, to USD 6,965m, largely attributable to the consolidation of Credit 
Suisse net interest income, and included USD 672m of accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments and other 
effects, with the remaining increase mainly driven by higher deposit margins, resulting from higher interest rates, partly 
offset by the effects of shifts to lower-margin deposit products. Excluding accretion effects, underlying net interest 
income was USD 6,293m.
Recurring net fee income increased by USD 511m, or 5%, to USD 10,793m, mainly driven by the consolidation of Credit 
Suisse recurring net fee income, partly offset by negative market performance.
Transaction-based income increased by USD 432m, or 14%, to USD 3,569m, mainly driven by the consolidation of Credit 
Suisse transaction-based income, and included USD 47m of accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments and 
other effects, partly offset by lower levels of client activity, particularly in Americas and Asia Pacific. Excluding accretion 
effects, underlying transaction-based income was USD 3,522m.
Other income was negative USD 137m, compared with positive other income of USD 275m, mainly as 2022 included 
gains from the sales of our domestic wealth management business in Spain, UBS Swiss Financial Advisers AG and our US 
alternative investments administration business. 2023 included the aforementioned losses of USD 190m related to our 
investment in SIX Group. Excluding these losses of USD 190m, underlying other income was positive USD 53m.
Credit loss expense / release
Net credit loss expenses were USD 147m, compared with net expenses of USD 0m, reflecting net credit loss expenses of 
USD 108m related to stage 1 and 2 positions and net credit loss expenses of USD 40m related to credit-impaired (stage 3 
and purchased credit-impaired) positions. Stage 1 and 2 expected credit loss (ECL) expenses of USD 108m were 
predominantly attributable to the initial recognition of ECL allowances and provisions on the date of the acquisition of 
the Credit Suisse Group.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased by USD 3,465m, or 25%, to USD 17,454m, largely due to the consolidation of Credit 
Suisse expenses, integration-related expenses and higher technology expenses. In addition, 2023 included a charge of 
USD 60m for the special assessment by the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) to recover losses incurred 
by the Deposit Insurance Fund in connection with the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. These effects 
were partly offset by lower provisions for litigation, regulatory and similar matters. Excluding integration-related expenses 
of USD 988m, underlying operating expenses were USD 16,466m.
Pre-tax profit growth
Pre-tax profit growth was negative 27.9%, compared with positive 4.1%.
Cost / income ratio
The cost / income ratio increased to 82.4% from 73.8%, as higher operating expenses more than offset higher total 
revenues.
Invested assets
Invested assets increased by USD 1,035bn, or 37%, to USD 3,850bn, mainly driven by the consolidation of Credit Suisse 
invested assets, positive market performance (excluding interest and dividends, which are now included in net new assets) 
of USD 249bn, net new asset inflows of USD 132bn and positive foreign currency effects of USD 34bn, partly offset by 
a reclassification of USD 38bn related to non-strategic relationships and a transfer of USD 5bn to Non-core and Legacy. 
Loans
Loans increased by USD 59.3bn to USD 284.3bn, mainly driven by the consolidation of Credit Suisse loans and positive 
foreign currency effects, partly offset by net new loan outflows of USD 20.7bn.

Annual Report 2023 | Financial and operating performance | Global Wealth Management 86
Customer deposits
Customer deposits increased by USD 118.7bn to USD 466.9bn, mainly driven by the consolidation of Credit Suisse 
customer deposits, net inflows into fixed-term deposit products, and positive foreign currency effects, partly offset by 
continued shifts into money market funds and US-government securities.

2023 compared with 2022
Results
Profit before tax increased by CHF 1,098m, or 64%, to CHF 2,824m, mainly due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse 
Group. Underlying profit before tax was CHF 2,591m, after excluding CHF 896m of accretion of purchase price allocation 
(PPA) adjustments on financial instruments and other effects, losses of CHF 267m related to our investment in SIX Group, 
integration-related expenses of CHF 337m, and CHF 58m of amortization from newly recognized intangibles resulting 
from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
Total revenues
Total revenues increased by CHF 3,442m, or 84%, to CHF 7,541m, mainly due to the consolidation of Credit Suisse 
revenues, and included CHF 896m of accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments and other effects. The 
remaining increase largely reflected increases across almost all income lines, predominantly in net interest income, partly 
offset by the aforementioned losses of CHF 267m in other income. Excluding the aforementioned accretion effects, 
underlying total revenues were CHF 6,912m.
Net interest income increased by CHF 2,640m, or 126%, to CHF 4,727m, largely attributable to the consolidation of 
Credit Suisse net interest income, and included CHF 811m of accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments and 
other effects, with the remaining increase mainly driven by higher deposit margins, which resulted from higher interest 
rates, and higher loan revenues, partly offset by lower deposit fees. 2022 included a benefit from the Swiss National 
Bank deposit exemption. Excluding accretion effects, underlying net interest income was CHF 3,916m.
Recurring net fee income increased by CHF 537m, or 66%, to CHF 1,349m, mainly attributable to the consolidation of 
Credit Suisse recurring net fee income, with the remaining increase mostly driven by higher revenues from account and 
custody fees.
Transaction-based income increased by CHF 509m, or 44%, to CHF 1,663m, largely attributable to the consolidation of 
Credit Suisse transaction-based income, and included CHF 85m of accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments 
and other effects, with the remaining increase mainly driven by higher income from Corporate & Institutional Clients. 
Excluding accretion effects, underlying transaction-based income was CHF 1,578m.
Other income was negative CHF 198m, compared with positive other income of CHF 46m, mainly reflecting the losses 
of CHF 267m related to our investment in SIX Group.
Credit loss expense / release
Net credit loss expenses were CHF 450m, compared with net expenses of CHF 36m, reflecting net credit loss expenses 
related to stage 1 and 2 positions and net credit loss expenses related to credit-impaired (stage 3 and purchased creditimpaired) positions. Stage 1 and 2 expected credit loss (ECL) expenses were predominantly attributable to the initial 
recognition of ECL allowances and provisions on the date of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased by CHF 1,930m, or 83%, to CHF 4,267m, largely due to the consolidation of Credit Suisse 
expenses, with the remaining increase mostly reflecting integration-related expenses, as well as higher technology 
expenses and accruals for variable compensation. Excluding integration-related expenses of CHF 337m and CHF 58m of 
amortization from newly recognized intangibles resulting from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, underlying 
operating expenses were CHF 3,872m.
Cost / income ratio
The cost / income ratio decreased to 56.6% from 57.0%, as an increase in total revenues more than offset an increase 
in operating expenses.

1 Information reflects Asset Management as reported on in the Annual Report 2022. 2 Net management fees include transaction fees, fund administration revenues (including net interest and trading income from 
lending activities and foreign-exchange hedging as part of the fund services offering), distribution fees, incremental fund-related expenses, gains or losses from seed money and co-investments, funding costs, the 
negative pass-through impact of third-party performance fees, and other items that are not Asset Management’s performance fees. 3 Only includes items that are deemed material. 4 Refer to “Alternative 
performance measures” in the appendix to this report for the definition and calculation method. 5 Starting with the second quarter of 2023, net new money and invested assets include net new money and invested 
assets from associates, to better reflect the business strategy. Comparative figures have been restated to reflect this change. 6 A net new money inflow of USD 4.1bn was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022 
for the provision of hedge fund services to Global Wealth Management Americas. 7 The invested assets and net new money amounts reported for associates are prepared in accordance with their local regulatory 
requirements and practices. 
2023 compared with 2022
Results
Profit before tax decreased by USD 1,079m, or 77%, to USD 318m, primarily due to 2022 including a gain of USD 848m 
from the sale of our shareholding in the Mitsubishi Corp.-UBS Realty Inc. joint venture. Excluding integration-related 
expenses of USD 205m, underlying profit before tax was USD 522m.
Total revenues
Total revenues decreased by USD 322m, or 11%, to USD 2,639m, primarily due to 2022 including the aforementioned 
gain of USD 848m. The decrease was partly offset by higher revenues due to the consolidation of Credit Suisse revenues 
and net gain from disposals of USD 27m, mainly from the completion of the sale of a majority stake in UBS Hana Asset 
Management Co., Ltd.
Net management fees increased by USD 457m, or 22%, to USD 2,507m, largely due to the consolidation of Credit Suisse 
net management fees, partly offset by negative market performance, continued margin compression and negative passthrough fees, with the corresponding offset in performance fees.
Performance fees increased by USD 40m, or 63%, to USD 104m, mainly attributable to the consolidation of Credit Suisse 
performance fees, the effect of the aforementioned pass-through fees and increases in Hedge Fund Businesses, partly 
offset by decreases in Real Estate & Private Markets and Equities.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased by USD 757m, or 48%, to USD 2,321m, mainly reflecting the consolidation of Credit Suisse 
expenses. The increase was also due to integration-related expenses, adverse foreign currency effects and increases in 
technology expenses, control function expenses, and outsourcing costs, partly offset by lower personnel expenses. 
Excluding integration-related expenses of USD 205m, underlying operating expenses were USD 2,116m. 
Cost / income ratio
The cost / income ratio increased to 88.0% from 52.8%, reflecting both higher operating expenses and lower total 
revenues. 
Invested assets
Invested assets increased by USD 561bn to USD 1,649bn, reflecting the consolidation of Credit Suisse invested assets, 
positive market performance of USD 108bn, positive foreign currency effects of USD 51bn and positive net new money 
of USD 16bn, partly offset by a reduction of USD 24bn related to divestments, primarily the sale of UBS Hana Asset 
Management Co., Ltd., and a reduction of USD 5bn due to the elimination of the cross-investments of the UBS Asset 
Management sub-group and the Credit Suisse Asset Management sub-group, as UBS policy does not allow for double 
counting of assets within the same reporting segment. Excluding money market flows and associates, net new money 
was negative USD 8bn.

2023 compared with 2022
Results
Loss before tax was USD 44m, compared with profit before tax of USD 1,897m in 2022, mainly due to higher operating 
expenses associated with the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, and included integration-related expenses, as well 
as lower total revenues. Excluding USD 583m of accretion of purchase price allocation (PPA) adjustments on financial 
instruments and integration-related expenses of USD 692m, underlying profit before tax was USD 64m.
Total revenues
Total revenues decreased by USD 56m, or 1%, to USD 8,661m, due to lower Global Markets revenues, which decreased 
by USD 864m, or 12%, partly offset by higher Global Banking revenues, which increased by USD 808m, or 51%. Prioryear total revenues included USD 93m of losses in the first quarter of 2022 from transactions with Russian counterparties. 
The consolidation of Credit Suisse revenues included USD 583m of accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments. 
Excluding the aforementioned accretion effects, underlying total revenues were USD 8,078m.
Global Banking
Global Banking revenues increased by USD 808m, or 51%, to USD 2,395m, mainly due to the consolidation of Credit 
Suisse revenues, and included USD 580m of accretion of PPA adjustments on financial instruments. Excluding accretion 
effects, underlying Global Banking revenues increased by USD 228m, or 14%. The relevant market fee pool1,2 decreased 
16%.
Advisory revenues increased by USD 13m, or 2%, to USD 746m, mainly due to higher merger and acquisition transaction 
revenues. The relevant global fee pool2 decreased 25%.
Capital Markets revenues increased by USD 795m, or 93%, to USD 1,649m, partly due to the consolidation of Credit 
Suisse revenues, and included USD 580m of the aforementioned accretion effects. Excluding accretion effects, underlying 
Capital Markets revenues increased by USD 215m, or 25%, mainly due to prior-year mark-to-market losses. Capital 
Markets fee-pool-comparable revenues increased 2% year on year. The relevant global fee pool1,2 decreased 7%.
Global Markets
Global Markets revenues decreased by USD 864m, or 12%, to USD 6,265m, primarily driven by lower Derivatives & 
Solutions revenues.
Execution Services revenues decreased by USD 65m, or 4%, to USD 1,578m, due to lower market volumes in Cash 
Equities, partly offset by higher revenues from foreign exchange products that are traded over electronic platforms.
Derivatives & Solutions revenues decreased by USD 958m, or 26%, to USD 2,707m, mostly driven by Equity Derivatives, 
Rates and Foreign Exchange, due to lower levels of both volatility and client activity.
Financing revenues increased by USD 159m, or 9%, to USD 1,981m, reflecting higher client balances.
Equities
Global Markets Equities revenues decreased by USD 424m, or 9%, to USD 4,546m, mainly driven by lower Equity 
Derivatives and Cash Equities revenues.
Foreign Exchange, Rates and Credit
Global Markets Foreign Exchange, Rates and Credit revenues decreased by USD 440m, or 20%, to USD 1,720m, primarily 
driven by lower Foreign Exchange and Rates revenues.
Credit loss expense / release

USD 110m related to stage 1 and 2 positions and net credit loss expenses of USD 80m related to credit-impaired (stage 3 
and purchased credit-impaired) positions. Stage 1 and 2 expected credit loss (ECL) expenses of USD 110m were 
predominantly attributable to the initial recognition of ECL allowances and provisions on the date of the acquisition of 
the Credit Suisse Group.
Operating expenses
Operating expenses increased by USD 1,683m, or 25%, to USD 8,515m, largely due to integration-related expenses, the 
consolidation of Credit Suisse expenses, and higher technology expenses. Excluding integration-related expenses of 
USD 692m, underlying operating expenses were USD 7,823m.
Cost / income ratio
The cost / income ratio increased to 98.3% from 78.4%, reflecting both higher operating expenses and lower total 
revenues.

2023 compared with 2022
Results
Loss before tax was USD 1,279m, compared with a loss of USD 611m, mainly due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse 
Group. Excluding USD 35m of accretion of purchase price allocation adjustments on financial instruments, integrationrelated expenses of USD 438m and acquisition-related costs of USD 202m, underlying loss before tax was USD 603m, 
compared with USD 679m in 2022, excluding a gain of USD 68m from the sale of real estate.
Income from Group hedging and own debt, including hedge accounting ineffectiveness, was net positive USD 247m, 
compared with net negative income of USD 375m. The results in the prior year were driven by mark-to-market effects 
on portfolio-level economic hedges due to rising interest rates and cross-currency-basis widening. Income related to 
centralized Group Treasury risk management was negative USD 256m, compared with negative USD 4m in 2022.
In addition, 2023 included a USD 272m increase in funding costs related to deferred tax assets, partly offset by 
remeasurement losses in 2022 of USD 46m on properties held for sale.

Overview of risks arising from our business activities
Key risks by business division and Group Items
Business divisions and Group Items Key financial risks arising from business activities
Global Wealth Management Credit risk from collateralized lending primarily against securities, private equity and hedge fund interest, 
investors’ uncalled capital commitments, and residential and commercial real estate, other real assets 
such as ships and aircraft, as well as from derivatives trading. Also includes corporate lending and other 
unsecured lending.
Market risk from municipal securities and taxable fixed-income securities. Interest rate risk in the 
banking book related to Global Wealth Management is transferred to and managed by Group Treasury.
Personal & Corporate Banking Credit risk from mortgages (owner-occupied and income-producing), secured and unsecured corporate 
lending, commodity trade finance, trade and export finance, consumer finance, and lending to banks and 
other regulated clients, as well as a small amount of derivatives trading activity.
Minimal contribution to market risk. Interest rate risk in the banking book related to Personal & 
Corporate Banking is transferred to and managed by Group Treasury.
Asset Management Credit risk and market risk on client assets invested in Asset Management funds can impact 
management and performance fees and cause heightened fund outflows, liquidity risk and losses on our 
seed capital and co-investments.
Small amounts of credit and market risk for on-balance sheet items. 
Investment Bank Credit risk from lending (take-and-hold, as well as temporary loan underwriting activities), derivatives 
trading and securities financing. 
Market risk from primary underwriting activities and secondary trading.
Non-core and Legacy Credit risk arising from large, less-liquid structured financing transactions, including some with 
residential and commercial real estate collateral, a material corporate loan portfolio and a counterparty 
credit trading portfolio with lending against securities collateral and derivatives. 
Market risk from structured trades, large portfolios of loans and securitized products, and both complex 
and simple credit, interest rate and equity derivative transactions.
Group Items Credit and market risk arising from management of the Group’s balance sheet, capital, profit or loss 
and liquidity portfolios.
Structural risk arising from asset and liability management and liquidity and funding risk (managed by 
Group Treasury).
Non-financial risks consist of compliance risks (including employment and conduct risks), financial crime, operational risk (including model risks and cyberand information-security risks), legal risks and reputational risks. These are an inevitable consequence of being in business and can arise as a result of our past 
and current business activities across all business divisions and Group Items.

Key risk developments
Upon the legal close of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, we have applied existing UBS prudent risk management 
practices to material risks of Credit Suisse. Positions and businesses not aligned with the core strategy and policies of UBS 
have been ring-fenced in the Non-core and Legacy business division, with the aim of ensuring a timely and orderly winddown. UBS’s transactional approval authorities were applied to Credit Suisse and a set of risk standards and escalation 
protocols were put in place to ensure the application of the UBS risk appetite to the combined organization. Our risk 
governance continued to operate along our three lines of defense, and our organizational structure has been adapted, 
with the aim of facilitating robust oversight of the combined business throughout the integration. A significant portion 
of our risk policies have been reviewed and harmonized. We are continuing to focus on aligning our policies while moving 
toward a fully integrated risk framework, which is expected to be achieved by the end of 2025.
Due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, we saw an increase in total net credit loss expenses to USD 1,037m 
and an increase in credit-impaired exposure to USD 6.4bn. Our banking products exposure increased to USD 1,179bn 
and our traded products exposure increased to USD 64bn. For UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse, market risk remained 
at low levels, as a result of our focus on managing tail risks, while Credit Suisse continues with the strategic migration of 
positions to UBS and de-risking within Non-core and Legacy.

Risk managed by
Independent 
oversight by
Financial risks
Audited | Credit risk: the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a client or counterparty to meet its 
contractual obligations toward UBS. This includes settlement risk, loan underwriting risk and step-in risk.
Settlement risk: the risk of loss resulting from transactions that involve exchange of value (e.g., 
security versus cash) where we must deliver without first being able to determine with certainty that 
we will receive the consideration.
Loan underwriting risk: the risk of loss arising during the holding period of financing transactions 
that are intended for further distribution.
Step-in risk: the risk that UBS may decide to provide financial support to an unconsolidated entity 
that is facing stress in the absence of, or in excess of, any contractual obligations to provide such 
support. 
Business divisions Risk Control
Audited | Market risk (traded and non-traded): the risk of loss resulting from adverse movements in 
market variables. Market variables include observable variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange 
rates, equity prices, credit spreads and commodity (including precious metal) prices, as well as variables 
that may be unobservable or only indirectly observable, such as volatilities and correlations. Market risk 
includes issuer risk and investment risk.
Issuer risk: the risk of loss that would occur if an issuer to which we are exposed through tradable 
securities or derivatives referencing the issuer was subject to a credit-related event.
Investment risk: issuer risk associated with positions held as financial investments. 
Business divisions and 
Group Treasury
Risk Control
Country risk: the risk of loss resulting from country-specific events. This includes the risk of sovereign 
default and also transfer risk, which involves a country’s authorities preventing or restricting the 
payment of an obligation, as well as systemic risk events arising from country-specific political or 
macroeconomic developments.
Business divisions Risk Control
Sustainability and climate risk: the risk that UBS negatively impacts, or is impacted by, climate 
change, natural capital, human rights, and other environmental, social and governance matters. Climate 
risks can arise from either changing climate conditions (physical risks) or from efforts to mitigate climate 
change (transition risks). Sustainability and climate risks may manifest as credit, market, liquidity, 
business and non-financial risks for UBS resulting in potential adverse financial, liability and reputational 
impacts. These risks extend to the value of investments and may also affect the value of collateral (e.g., 
real estate).
Business divisions Risk Control
Treasury risk: the risks associated with asset and liability management and our liquidity and funding 
positions, as well as structural exposures including pension risks.

Audited | Liquidity risk: the risk that the firm will not be able to efficiently meet both expected and 
unexpected current and forecast cash flows and collateral needs without affecting either daily 
operations or the financial condition of the firm. 
Audited | Funding risk: the risk that the firm will be unable, on an ongoing basis, to borrow funds in 
the market on an unsecured (or even secured) basis at an acceptable price to fund actual or 
proposed commitments, i.e., the risk that UBS’s funding capacity is not sufficient to support the 
firm’s current business and desired strategy. 
Interest rate risk in the banking book: the risk to the firm’s capital and earnings arising from the 
adverse effects of interest rate movements on the firm’s banking book positions. The risk is 
transferred from the originating business divisions, i.e., Global Wealth Management and Personal & 
Corporate Banking, to Group Treasury to risk manage this centrally and benefit from Group-wide 
netting while leaving the business divisions with margin management.
Structural foreign exchange risk: the risk of decreases in our capital due to changes in foreign 
exchange rates with an adverse translation effect on capital held in currencies other than the 
US dollar.
Pension risk: the risk of a negative impact on our capital as a result of deteriorating funded status 
from decreases in the fair value of assets held in defined benefit pension funds and / or changes in 
the value of defined benefit pension obligations due to changes in actuarial assumptions (e.g., 
discount rate, life expectancy, rate of pension increase) and / or changes to plan designs.

Top and emerging risks
The top and emerging risks disclosed below reflect those that we currently think have the potential to materialize within 
one year and which could significantly affect the Group. Investors should also carefully review all information set out in 
the “Risk factors” section of this report, where we discuss these and other material risks that we consider could have an 
effect on our ability to execute our strategy and may affect our business activities, financial condition, results of operations 
and business prospects.
– We remain watchful of a range of geopolitical developments and political changes in a number of countries, as well 
as international tensions arising from the Russia–Ukraine war, conflicts in the Middle East and US–China trade relations. 
Geopolitical tensions will continue to create uncertainty and complicate the energy price outlook. We are closely 
watching elections in several key markets in 2024.
– Inflation has abated to some extent in major Western economies, though there are still concerns regarding future 
developments, and central banks’ monetary policy is in the spotlight. The potential for “higher-for-longer” interest 
rates raises the prospect of a global recession, particularly as the growth of China’s economy has been muted. This 
combination of factors translates into a more uncertain and volatile environment, which increases the risk of financial 
market disruption. 
– We are exposed to a number of macroeconomic issues, as well as general market conditions. As noted in “Market, 
credit and macroeconomic risks” in the “Risk factors” section of this report, these external pressures may have a 
significant adverse effect on our business activities and related financial results, primarily through reduced margins 
and revenues, asset impairments and other valuation adjustments. Accordingly, these macroeconomic factors are 
considered in the development of stress-testing scenarios for our ongoing risk management activities.
– We are monitoring the downturn in the commercial real estate sector. Adverse effects on valuations from higher 
interest rates and structural decline in demand for office and retail space may trigger broader impacts given bank and 
non-bank lenders’ material balance sheet exposure to the sector. 
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 101
– We are exposed to substantial changes in the regulation of our businesses that could have a material adverse effect 
on our business, as discussed in the “Regulatory and legal developments” section of this report and in “Regulatory 
and legal risks” in the “Risk factors” section of this report.
– As a global financial services firm, we are subject to many different legal, tax and regulatory regimes and extensive 
regulatory oversight. We are exposed to significant liability risk, and we are subject to various claims, disputes, legal 
proceedings and government investigations, as noted in “Regulatory and legal risks” in the “Risk factors” section of 
this report. Information about litigation, regulatory and similar matters we consider significant is disclosed in “Note 18 
Provisions and contingent liabilities” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report.
– Global geopolitical trends increase the likelihood of external state-driven cyber activity. Alongside a general trend 
toward more sophisticated forms of ransomware and other cyber threats, there is a risk of business disruption or 
corruption or loss of data. Additionally, as a result of the dynamic and material nature of recent geopolitical and 
environmental events and the operational complexity of all our businesses, we are continually exposed to operational 
resilience scenarios such as process error, failed execution, system failures and fraud.
– Conduct risks are inherent in our businesses. Achieving fair outcomes for our clients, upholding market integrity and 
cultivating the highest standards of employee conduct are of critical importance to us. Management of conduct risks 
is an integral part of our risk management framework. Financial crime (including money laundering, terrorist financing, 
sanctions violations, fraud, bribery, and corruption) presents significant risk. Heightened regulatory expectations and 
attention require investment in people and systems, while emerging technologies and changing geopolitical risks 
further increase the complexity of identifying and preventing financial crime.

report for more information
– Sustainability and climate risks continue to be in the focus of regulators and stakeholders, with further emphasis put 
on measurement of nature-related risk and management of greenwashing risks in 2023. To address these emerging 
risks, UBS has enhanced its nature-related risk methodology and established guidelines for sustainable lending, bonds 
and GHG Emissions Trading to address potential greenwashing risks. 
› Refer to “Sustainability and climate risk” in this section of the report for more information
› Refer to “Appendix 2 – Governance” to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, available under “Annual reporting” at 
ubs.com/investors, for a full description of our sustainability and climate risk policy framework
– In addition, industry guidelines and regulations are emerging simultaneously in various jurisdictions, leading to an 
increased risk of divergence, which in turn increases the risk that UBS may not comply with all relevant regulations.
› Refer to “Sustainability and climate risk” and “Non-financial risk” sections of this report
– New risks continue to emerge. For example, client demand for distributed ledger technology, blockchain-based assets 
and virtual currencies creates new risks, to which we currently have limited exposure and for which relevant control 
frameworks are continuously enhanced and implemented.
Risk governance
Our risk governance framework operates along three lines of defense. 
Our first line of defense, business management, owns its risks and is accountable for maintaining effective processes and 
systems to manage them in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, as well as internal standards, including 
identifying control weaknesses and inadequate processes.
Our second line of defense, control functions, is separate from the business and reports directly to the Group Chief 
Executive Officer (the Group CEO). Control functions provide independent oversight, challenge financial and non-financial 
risks arising from the firm’s business activities, and establish independent frameworks for risk assessment, measurement, 
aggregation, control and reporting, protecting against non-compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Our third line of defense, Group Internal Audit (GIA), reports to the Chairman and to the Audit Committee. This function 
assesses the design and operating effectiveness and sustainability of processes to define risk appetite, governance, risk 
management, internal controls, remediation activities and processes to comply with legal and regulatory requirements 
and internal governance standards.
The key roles and responsibilities for risk management and control are shown in the chart below and described further 
below.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 102
Audited | The Board of Directors (the BoD) approves the risk management and control framework of the Group, including 
the Group and business division overall risk appetite. The BoD is supported by its Risk Committee, which monitors and 
oversees the Group’s risk profile and the implementation of the risk framework approved by the BoD, and approves the 
Group’s risk appetite methodology. The Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee (the CCRC) helps the BoD meet 
its duty to safeguard and advance UBS’s reputation for responsible and sustainable conduct, reviewing stakeholder 
concerns and expectations pertaining to UBS’s societal contribution and corporate culture. The Audit Committee assists 
the BoD with its oversight duty relating to financial reporting and internal controls over financial reporting, and the 
effectiveness of whistleblowing procedures and the external and internal audit functions.
The Group Executive Board (the GEB) has overall responsibility for establishing and implementing a risk management and 
control framework in the Group, managing the risk profile of the Group as a whole.
The Group CEO has responsibility and accountability for the management and performance of the Group, has risk 
authority over transactions, positions and exposures, and allocates risk authority delegated by the BoD to the business 
divisions and Group functions.
The business division Presidents and Group functional heads are responsible for the operation and management of their 
business divisions and Group functions, including controlling the risk appetite of the business divisions.
The regional Presidents ensure cross-divisional collaboration in their regions and are mandated to inform the GEB about 
any regional activities and issues that may give rise to actual or potentially material regulatory or reputational concerns.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 103
The Group Chief Risk Officer (the Group CRO) is responsible for developing the Group’s risk management and control 
framework (including risk principles and risk appetite) for credit, market, country, treasury, model and sustainability and 
climate risks. This includes risk measurement and aggregation, portfolio controls, risk reporting, and taking decisions on 
transactions, positions, exposures, portfolio limits and allowances in accordance with the risk control authorities 
delegated to the Group CRO.
The Group Chief Compliance and Governance Officer is responsible for developing the Group’s risk management and 
control framework (including taxonomies and risk appetite) for non-financial risks, as well as implementing independent 
control frameworks for these risks.
The Group Chief Financial Officer (the Group CFO) is responsible for transparency in assessing the financial performance 
of the Group and the business divisions, and for managing the Group’s financial accounting, controlling, forecasting, 
planning and reporting. Additional responsibilities include managing and controlling UBS’s tax affairs, treasury and capital 
management, including regulatory ratios, asset and liability management, and developing UBS’s inorganic strategy 
(mergers and acquisitions) in collaboration with the GEB. 
The Group Chief Operations and Technology Officer is responsible for driving Group-wide digitalization, delivering 
technology services, infrastructure and operations, including cybersecurity and information security, for our clients and 
employees, and providing Group-wide data governance. 
The Group General Counsel manages the Group’s legal affairs, ensuring effective and timely assessment of legal matters 
impacting the Group or its businesses, and managing and reporting all litigation matters.
The Head Group Human Resources & Group Corporate Services defines and executes a human resources strategy aligned to UBS’s 
objectives, supplies real estate infrastructure and controls supply and demand management activities.
The Group Integration Officer develops UBS’s integration strategy with regard to Credit Suisse within agreed design 
principles and in accordance with UBS’s strategy and coordinates with integration teams to ensure coherent and 
consistent execution of integration plans and milestones.
GIA independently assesses the soundness of UBS’s risk and control culture and reliability of financial and operational 
information. GIA also assesses the design, operating effectiveness and sustainability of processes to define strategy and 
risk appetite, governance processes, risk management, internal controls, remediation activities and processes to comply 
with legal and regulatory requirements and internal documents. The Head GIA reports to the Chairman of the BoD. GIA 
also has a functional reporting line to the BoD Audit Committee.
Some of these roles and responsibilities are replicated for significant entities of the Group. Designated entity risk officers 
oversee and control financial and non-financial risks for significant entities of UBS as part of the entity control framework, 
which complements the Group’s risk management and control framework. 
Risk appetite framework
We have a defined Group-level risk appetite, covering financial and non-financial risk types, via a complementary set of 
qualitative and quantitative risk appetite statements. This is reviewed and recalibrated annually and presented to the 
BoD for approval.
Our risk appetite is defined at the aggregate Group level and reflects the risk that we are willing to accept or wish to 
avoid. It is set via complementary qualitative and quantitative risk appetite statements defined at a firm-wide level and is 
embedded throughout our business divisions and legal entities by Group, business division and legal entity policies, limits 
and authorities. Our risk appetite is reviewed and recalibrated annually, with the aim of ensuring that risk-taking at every 
level of the organization is in line with our strategic priorities, our capital and liquidity plans, our Pillars, Principles and 
Behaviors, and minimum regulatory requirements. The “Risk appetite framework” chart below shows the key elements 
of the framework, which is described in detail in this section.
Qualitative risk appetite statements aim to ensure we maintain the desired risk culture. Quantitative risk appetite 
objectives are designed to enhance UBS’s resilience against the effects of potential severe adverse economic or 
geopolitical events. These risk appetite objectives cover minimum capital and leverage ratios, solvency, earnings, liquidity 
and funding, and are subject to periodic review, including the yearly business planning process. These objectives are 
complemented by a standardized set of quantitative firm-wide non-financial risk appetite objectives established at the 
Group and business division levels. Non-financial risk events exceeding predetermined risk tolerances, expressed as 
percentages of UBS’s total operating income, must be escalated as per the firm-wide escalation framework.
The quantitative risk appetite objectives are supported by a comprehensive suite of risk limits set at a portfolio level to 
monitor specific portfolios and to identify potential risk concentrations. 
The status of our quantitative risk appetite objectives is evaluated each month and reported to the BoD and the GEB. As 
our risk appetite may change over time, portfolio limits and associated approval authorities are subject to periodic reviews 
and changes, particularly in the context of our annual business planning process. 
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 104
Our risk appetite framework is governed by a single overarching policy and conforms to the Financial Stability Board’s 
Principles for an Effective Risk Appetite Framework. The former UBS risk appetite framework is applied to the combined 
UBS Group.
Risk principles and risk culture
Maintaining a strong risk culture is a prerequisite for success in today’s highly complex operating environment and a 
source of sustainable competitive advantage. 
Our risk appetite framework combines all the important elements of our risk culture, expressed in our Pillars, Principles 
and Behaviors, our risk management and control principles, our Code of Conduct and Ethics, and our Total Reward 
Principles. They help to create a solid foundation for promoting risk awareness, leading to appropriate risk-taking and 
the establishing of robust risk management and control processes. These principles are supported by a range of initiatives 
covering employees at all levels, for example the UBS House View on Leadership, which is a set of explicit expectations 
that establishes consistent leadership standards across UBS, and our Principles of Good Supervision, which establish clear 
expectations of managers and employees regarding supervisory responsibilities, specifically: to take responsibility; to 
know and organize their business; to know their employees and what they do; to create a good risk culture; and to 
respond to and resolve issues. 
› Refer to “Employees” in the “How we create value for our stakeholders” section of this report for more information about our 
Pillars, Principles and Behaviors
› Refer to the Code of Conduct and Ethics of UBS at ubs.com/code for more information
Risk management and control principles
Protection of financial strength Protecting UBS’s financial strength by controlling our risk exposure and avoiding potential risk 
concentrations at individual exposure levels, at specific portfolio levels and at an aggregate firm-wide 
level across all risk types.
Protection of reputation Protecting our reputation through a sound risk culture characterized by a holistic and integrated view of 
risk, performance and reward, and through full compliance with our standards and principles, particularly 
our Code of Conduct and Ethics.
Business management accountability Maintaining management accountability, whereby business management owns all risks assumed 
throughout the Group and is responsible for the continuous and active management of all risk exposures 
to provide for balanced risk and return.
Independent controls Independent control functions that monitor the effectiveness of the businesses’ risk management and 
oversee risk-taking activities.
Risk disclosure Disclosure of risks to senior management, the BoD, investors, regulators, credit rating agencies and other 
stakeholders with an appropriate level of comprehensiveness and transparency.
Whistleblowing policies and procedures exist to encourage an environment where staff are comfortable raising concerns. 
There are multiple channels via which individuals may, either openly or anonymously, escalate suspected breaches of 
laws, regulations, rules and other legal requirements, our Code of Conduct and Ethics, policies or relevant professional 
standards. We are committed to ensuring there is appropriate training and communication to staff and legal entity 
representatives, including information about new regulatory requirements.
Mandatory training programs cover various compliance-related and risk-related topics, including operational risk and 
anti-money laundering. Additional specialized training is provided depending on employees’ specific roles and 
responsibilities, e.g., credit risk and market risk training for those working in trading areas. 
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 105
Quantitative risk appetite objectives
Our quantitative risk appetite objectives aim to ensure that our aggregate risk exposure remains within desired risk 
capacity, based on capital and business plans. The specific definition of risk capacity for each objective is aimed at ensuring 
we have sufficient capital, earnings, funding and liquidity to protect our businesses and exceed minimum regulatory 
requirements under a severe stress event. The risk appetite objectives are evaluated during the annual business planning 
process and approved by the BoD. The comparison of risk exposure with risk capacity is a key consideration in decisions 
on potential adjustments to the business strategy, risk profile, and the level of capital returns to shareholders.
In the annual business planning process, UBS’s business strategy is reviewed, the risk profile that our operations and 
activities result in is assessed, and that risk profile is stressed. We use both scenario-based stress tests and economic 
capital risk measurement techniques to assess the effects of severe stress events at a firm-wide level. These 
complementary frameworks capture exposures to material risks across our business divisions and Group Items.
The BoD has approved the following risk appetite objectives for the combined UBS Group. 
› Refer to “Risk measurement” in this section for more information about our stress testing and economic capital measures
Our risk capacity is underpinned by performance targets and capital guidance as per our business plan. When determining 
our risk capacity in case of a severe stress event, we estimate projected earnings under stress, factoring in lower expected 
income and expenses. We also consider capital impacts under stress from deferred tax assets, pension plan assets and 
liabilities, and accruals for capital returns to shareholders.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 106
Risk appetite objectives define the aggregate risk exposure acceptable at the firm-wide level, given our risk capacity. The 
maximum acceptable risk exposure is supported by a full set of risk limits, which are cascaded to businesses and portfolios. 
These limits aim to ensure that our risks remain in line with risk appetite.
Risk appetite statements at the business division level are derived from the firm-wide risk appetite. They may also include 
division-specific strategic goals related to that division’s activities and risks. Risk appetite statements are also set for certain 
legal entities, which must be consistent with the firm-wide risk appetite framework and approved in accordance with 
Group and legal entity regulations. Differences may exist that reflect the specific nature, size, complexity and regulations 
applicable to the relevant legal entity.
Internal risk reporting
Comprehensive and transparent reporting of risks is central to our risk governance framework’s control and oversight 
responsibilities and required by our risk management and control principles. Accordingly, risks are reported at a frequency 
and level of detail commensurate with the extent and variability of the risk and the needs of the various governance 
bodies, regulators and risk authority holders.
Since the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, the Group Risk Summary report provides a monthly overview of the 
combined risk profile across UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG, covering both financial and non-financial risks. The report 
recently also included the status of our risk appetite objectives and the results of firm-wide stress testing. With respect 
to financial risks, the Group Risk Summary includes a view of aggregated risk exposures, to the extent metrics are broadly 
comparable. The Group Risk Summary is distributed internally to the BoD, the GEB and senior members of Risk Control 
and GIA. In parallel, respective senior management continues to be informed about the two parent banks’ risks in more 
detail via the UBS AG Risk Report (formerly the Group Risk Report), the Credit Suisse AG Financial Risk Report and the 
Credit Suisse AG Non-Financial Risk Report. 
Monthly divisional risk reports are supplemented with daily or weekly reports, at various levels of granularity, covering 
market and credit risks for the business divisions to enable risk officers and senior management to monitor and control 
the Group’s risk profile. 
Our internal risk reporting covers financial and non-financial risks and is supported by risk data and measurement systems 
that are also used for external disclosure and regulatory reporting. Dedicated units within Risk Control assume 
responsibility for measurement, analysis and reporting of risk and for overseeing the quality and integrity of risk-related 
data. Our risk data and measurement systems are subject to periodic review by GIA, following a risk-based audit 
approach. 
Model risk management
Introduction
We rely on models to inform risk management and control decisions, to measure risks or exposures, value instruments 
or positions, conduct stress testing, assess adequacy of capital, and manage clients’ assets and our own assets. Models 
may also be used to measure and monitor compliance with rules and regulations, for surveillance activities, or to meet 
financial or regulatory reporting requirements. 
Model risk is defined as the risk of adverse consequences (e.g., financial losses or reputational damage) resulting from 
incorrect or misused models.
Model governance framework
Our model governance framework establishes requirements for identifying, measuring, monitoring, reporting, controlling 
and mitigating model risk. All the models that we use are subject to governance and controls throughout their life cycles, 
with rigor, depth and frequency determined by the model’s materiality and complexity. This is designed to ensure that 
risks arising from model use are identified, understood, managed, monitored, controlled and reported on both a modelspecific and an aggregated level. Before they can be granted approval for use, all our models are independently validated. 
Once validated and approved for use, a model is subject to ongoing model monitoring and regular model confirmation, 
ensuring that the model is only used if it continues to be found fit for purpose. All models are subject to periodic model 
re-validation.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 107
Our model risk governance framework follows our overarching risk governance framework, with the three lines of 
defense (LoD) assigned as follows.
– First LoD: individuals responsible for development, maintenance and appropriate use of the models, within business 
units and Group functions.
– Second LoD: individuals responsible for independent review of and effective challenge to the models, the Model Risk 
Management & Control function headed by the Chief Model Risk Officer.
– Third LoD: Group Internal Audit.
An important difference as compared with how LoD are usually defined in financial and non-financial risk is that some 
models are owned by traditionally second LoD functions, such as Risk Control, Finance or Compliance.
Model risk appetite framework and statement
The model risk appetite framework sets out the model risk appetite statement, defines the relevant metrics and lays out 
how appropriate adherence is assessed.
Model oversight
Model oversight committees and forums ensure that model risk is overseen at different levels of the organization, 
appropriate model risk management and control actions are taken and, where necessary, escalated to the next level. 
The Group Model Governance Committee is our most senior oversight and escalation body for all models in scope of our 
model governance framework. It is co-chaired by the Group CRO and the Group CFO and is responsible for: (i) reviewing 
and approving changes to the framework; (ii) approving the model risk appetite statement; (iii) overseeing adherence to 
the UBS model risk governance framework; and (iv) monitoring model risk at a firm-wide level.
Risk measurement
Audited | We apply a variety of methodologies and measurements to quantify the risks of our portfolios and potential risk 
concentrations. Risks that are not fully reflected within standard measures are subject to additional controls, which may 
include preapproval of specific transactions and the application of specific restrictions. Models to quantify risk are 
generally developed by dedicated units within control functions and are subject to independent validation. 
› Refer to “Credit risk,” “Market risk” and “Non-financial risk” in this section for more information about model confirmation 
procedures
The text below describes the scenario-based stress testing and economic capital measures of UBS AG on a consolidated 
basis during 2023. As part of the ongoing integration of Credit Suisse, we have made significant progress in the 
evaluation and alignment of our stress testing and economic capital approaches and results. We will continue to integrate 
our risk methodologies and measurements as Credit Suisse portfolios migrate to UBS infrastructure.
Stress testing
We perform stress testing to estimate losses that could result from extreme yet plausible macroeconomic and geopolitical 
stress events to identify, better understand and manage our potential vulnerabilities and risk concentrations. Stress testing 
has a key role in our limits framework at the firm-wide, business division, legal entity and portfolio levels. Stress test 
results are regularly reported to the BoD and the GEB. As described in “Risk appetite framework,” stress testing, along 
with economic capital measures, has a central role in our risk appetite and business planning processes.
Our stress testing framework has three pillars: (i) combined stress tests; (ii) an extensive set of portfolio- and risk-typespecific stress tests; and (iii) reverse stress testing.
The combined stress testing (CST) framework is scenario-based and aims to quantify overall firm-wide losses that could 
result from various potential global systemic events. The framework captures all material risks, as covered in “Risk 
categories.” Scenarios are forward-looking and encompass macroeconomic and geopolitical stress events calibrated to 
different levels of severity. We implement each scenario through the expected evolution of market indicators and 
economic variables under that scenario and then estimate the overall loss and capital implications were the scenario to 
occur. Following the existing UBS AG scenario governance, at least once a year, the Risk Committee approves the most 
relevant scenario, known as the binding scenario, for use as the main scenario for regular CST reporting and for 
monitoring risk exposure against our minimum capital, earnings and leverage ratio objectives in our risk appetite 
framework. 
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 108
We provide detailed stress loss analyses to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and regulators of 
our legal entities in accordance with their requirements. 
Our Enterprise-wide Stress Forum (the ESF) aims to ensure the consistency and adequacy of the assumptions and scenarios 
used for firm-wide stress measures. As part of its responsibilities, the ESF, with input from the Think Tank, a panel of 
senior representatives from the business divisions, Risk Control and Economic Research, seeks to ensure that the set of 
stress scenarios adequately reflects current and potential developments in the macroeconomic and geopolitical 
environment, current and planned business activities, and actual or potential risk concentrations and vulnerabilities in our 
portfolios. 
Each scenario captures a wide range of macroeconomic variables, including GDP, equity prices, interest rates, foreign 
exchange rates, commodity prices, property prices and unemployment. We use assumed changes in these 
macroeconomic and market variables in each scenario to stress the key risk drivers of our portfolios. We also capture the 
business risk resulting from lower fee, interest and trading income net of lower expenses. These effects are measured for 
all businesses and material risk types to calculate the aggregate estimated effect of the scenario on profit or loss, other 
comprehensive income, risk-weighted assets, the leverage ratio denominator and, ultimately, capital and leverage ratios. 
The assumed changes in macroeconomic variables are updated periodically to account for changes in the current and 
possible future market environment.
In 2023, the binding scenario for CST was the internal stagflationary geopolitical crisis scenario. This scenario assumes 
that a geopolitical event leads to economic regionalization and fears of prolonged stagflation. Central banks signal a firm 
commitment to price stability and continue to tighten monetary policy, triggering a broad rise in interest rates and 
impacting economic activity and asset values.
As part of the CST framework, we routinely monitored three additional stress scenarios throughout 2023:
– The global crisis scenario assumes a fall in global trade, which particularly hits China and leads to a hard landing. 
Combined with political, solvency and liquidity concerns, this results in a sharp sell-off of emerging markets sovereign 
debt and some emerging markets default. The macroeconomic and market impacts amplify concerns about peripheral 
European sovereign debt, causing Greece and Cyprus to default.
– The global depression scenario explores a global risk-off market with a combination of political, solvency and liquidity 
concerns around emerging markets sovereign debt, causing several large emerging markets to default. Several 
European economies also default, and some leave the Eurozone. A negative feedback loop between collapsing 
demand, declining asset values and commodity prices, and disruption in the banking system leads to a deep and 
prolonged recession across the globe. 
– The US monetary crisis scenario explores a loss of confidence in the US, which leads to a sell-off of US dollardenominated assets, sparking an abrupt and substantial depreciation of the US dollar. The US economy is hit hard, 
financial markets enter a period of high volatility and other industrialized countries replicate the cyclical pattern of the 
US. Regional inflation trends diverge as the US experiences significant inflationary pressures while other developed 
markets experience deflation.
Portfolio-specific stress tests are measures tailored to the risks of specific portfolios. Our portfolio stress loss measures are 
derived from data on past events, but also include forward-looking elements (e.g., we derive the expected market 
movements in our liquidity-adjusted stress metric using a combination of historical market behavior, based on an analysis 
of historical events, and forward-looking analysis, including consideration of defined scenarios that have never occurred). 
Results of portfolio-specific stress tests may be subject to limits to explicitly control risk-taking or may be monitored 
without limits to identify vulnerabilities.
Reverse stress testing starts from a defined stress outcome (e.g., a specified loss amount, reputational damage, a liquidity 
shortfall or a breach of minimum capital ratios) and works backward to identify macroeconomic scenarios and / or 
idiosyncratic events that could result in such an outcome. As such, reverse stress testing is intended to complement 
scenario-based stress tests by assuming “what if” outcomes that could extend beyond the range normally considered, 
and thereby potentially challenge assumptions regarding severity and plausibility.
We also routinely analyze the effect of increases or decreases in interest rates and changes in the structure of yield curves.
Within Group Treasury, we also perform stress testing to determine the optimal asset and liability structure, enabling us 
to maintain an appropriately balanced liquidity and funding position under various scenarios. These scenarios differ from 
those outlined above, because they focus on specific situations that could generate liquidity and funding stress, as 
opposed to the scenarios used in the CST framework, which focus on the effect on profit or loss and capital.

› Refer to “Note 20 Expected credit loss measurement” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report for more 
information about scenarios used for expected credit loss measurement
Economic capital measures
We complement the scenario-based CST measures with economic capital stress measures to calculate and aggregate 
risks using statistical techniques to derive stress events at chosen confidence levels.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 109
This framework is used to derive a loss distribution, considering effects on both income and expenses, based on the 
simulation of historically observed financial and economic risk factors in combination with the firm’s actual earnings and 
relevant risk exposures. From that, we determine earnings-at-risk (EaR), measuring the potential shortfall in earnings (i.e., 
the deviation from forecast earnings) at a 95% confidence level and evaluated over a one-year horizon. EaR is used for 
the assessment of the earnings objectives in our risk appetite framework.
We extend the EaR measure, incorporating the effects of gains and losses recognized through other comprehensive 
income, to derive a distribution of potential effects of stress events on common equity tier 1 capital. From this distribution, 
we derive our capital-at-risk (CaR) buffer measure at a 95% confidence level to assess our capital and leverage ratio risk 
appetite objectives, and derive our CaR solvency measure at a 99.9% confidence level to assess our solvency risk appetite 
objective.
We use the CaR solvency measure as a basis for deriving the contributions of the business divisions to risk-based capital 
(RBC). RBC measures the potential capital impairment from an extreme stress event at a 99.9% confidence level.
Portfolio and position limits
UBS maintains a comprehensive set of risk limits across its major risk portfolios. These portfolio limits are set based on 
our risk appetite and periodically reviewed and adjusted as part of the business planning process.
Firm-wide stress and statistical metrics are complemented by more granular portfolio and position limits, triggers and 
targets. Combining these measures provides a comprehensive framework for control of the key risks of our business 
divisions, as well as significant legal entities.
UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG apply limits to a variety of exposures at the portfolio level, using statistical and stress-based 
measures, such as value-at-risk, liquidity-adjusted stress, loan underwriting limits, economic value sensitivity and portfolio 
default simulations for loan books. These are complemented with a set of controls for net interest income sensitivity, 
mark-to-market losses on available-for-sale portfolios, and the effect of foreign exchange movements on capital and 
capital ratios.
Portfolio measures are supplemented with counterparty- and position-level controls. Risk measures for position controls 
are based on market risk sensitivities and counterparty-level credit risk exposures. Market risk sensitivities include 
sensitivities to changes in general market risk factors (e.g., equity indices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates) and 
sensitivities to issuer-specific factors (e.g., changes in an issuer’s credit spread or default risk). We monitor numerous 
market and treasury risk controls on a daily basis. Counterparty measures capture the current and potential future 
exposure to an individual counterparty, considering collateral and legally enforceable netting agreements. 
Since the legal close of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in June 2023, UBS has implemented a set of combined 
portfolio limits applied to UBS Group AG to oversee the aggregate risk profile, while UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG 
continue to operate under their existing risk management and limit frameworks until the merger of the two entities in 
the second quarter of 2024. This initial set of combined limits was further reviewed and extended to cover additional 
main risk portfolios of the Group in January 2024.

Risk concentrations
Audited | Risk concentrations may exist where one or several positions within or across different risk categories could result 
in significant losses relative to UBS’s financial strength. Identifying such risk concentrations and assessing their potential 
impact is a critical component of our risk management and control process.
For financial risks, we consider a number of elements, such as shared characteristics of positions, the size of the portfolio 
and the sensitivity of positions to changes in the underlying risk factors. Also important in our assessment is the liquidity 
of the markets where the positions are traded, as well as the availability and effectiveness of hedges or other potential 
risk-mitigating factors. This includes an assessment of, for example, the provider of the hedge and market liquidity where 
the hedge might be traded. Particular attention is given to identification of wrong-way risk and risk on risk. Wrong-way 
risk is defined as a positive correlation between the size of the exposure and the likelihood of a loss. Risk on risk is when 
a position and its risk mitigation can be impacted by the same event.
For non-financial risks, risk concentrations may result from, for example, a single operational risk issue that is large on its 
own (i.e., it has the potential to produce a single high-impact loss or a number of losses that together are high impact) 
or related risk issues that may link together to create a high impact.
Risk concentrations are subject to increased oversight by Group Risk Control and Group Compliance, Regulatory & 
Governance, and assessed to determine whether they should be reduced or mitigated, depending on the available means 
to do so. It is possible that material losses could occur on financial or non-financial risks, particularly if the correlations 
that emerge in a stressed environment differ markedly from those envisaged by risk models. 

Credit risk
Audited | Main sources of credit risk 
– Global Wealth Management credit risk arises from collateralized lending, primarily against securities, private equity 
and hedge fund interest, investors’ uncalled capital commitments, residential and commercial real estate, and other 
real assets such as ships and aircraft, as well as from derivatives trading. In addition, risk also arises from its corporate 
lending and other unsecured lending.
– A substantial portion of lending exposure arises from Personal & Corporate Banking, which offers mortgage loans, 
secured mainly by owner-occupied properties and income-producing real estate, as well as corporate loans, and 
therefore depends on the performance of the Swiss economy and real estate market.
– The Investment Bank’s credit exposure arises mainly from lending, derivatives trading and securities financing. 
Derivatives trading and securities financing are mainly investment grade. Loan underwriting activity can be lower rated 
and gives rise to temporary concentrated exposure.
– Credit risk within Non-core and Legacy relates to large, less-liquid structured financing transactions, including some 
with residential and commercial real estate collateral, a material corporate loan portfolio and a counterparty credit 
trading portfolio with lending against securities collateral and derivatives. 
Credit loss expense / release
Total net credit loss expenses were USD 1,037m in 2023, reflecting net credit loss expenses of USD 593m related to 
stage 1 and 2 positions and net credit loss expenses of USD 445m related to credit-impaired (stage 3 and purchased 
credit-impaired) positions. Expected credit loss (ECL) expenses of USD 593m for the performing loans were predominantly 
attributable to the initial recognition of expected credit loss allowances and provisions after the date of the acquisition 
of the Credit Suisse Group. Credit-impaired net expenses amounted to USD 445m, of which USD 325m was within the 
Credit Suisse portfolio and USD 120m was within the UBS portfolio. As per IFRS 9, no ECL allowances and provisions had 
to be recognized at the acquisition date for credit-impaired exposures, after the fair valuation as per the purchase price 
allocation.

Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 111
Audited | Overview of measurement, monitoring and management techniques
– Credit risk from transactions with individual counterparties is based on our estimates of probability of default (PD), 
exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD). Limits are established for individual counterparties and groups 
of related counterparties covering banking and traded products, and for settlement amounts. Risk authorities are 
approved by the Board of Directors and are delegated to the Group CEO, the Group Chief Risk Officer (the CRO) and 
divisional CROs, based on risk exposure amounts, internal credit rating and potential for losses.
– Limits apply not only to the current outstanding amount but also to contingent commitments and the potential future 
exposure of traded products.
– The Investment Bank monitoring, measurement and limit framework distinguishes between exposures intended to be 
held to maturity (take-and-hold exposures) and those intended for distribution or risk transfer (temporary exposures).
– We use models to derive portfolio credit risk measures of expected loss, statistical loss and stress loss at Group-wide 
and business division levels, and to establish portfolio limits.
– Credit risk concentrations can arise if clients are engaged in similar activities, located in the same geographical region 
or have comparable economic characteristics, e.g., if their ability to meet contractual obligations would be similarly 
affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions. To avoid credit risk concentrations, we establish limits 
/ operational controls that constrain risk concentrations at portfolio, sub-portfolio or counterparty levels for sector 
exposure, country risk and specific product exposures. 
Credit risk profile of the Group
The exposures detailed in this section are based on management’s view of credit risk, which differs in certain respects 
from the ECL measurement requirements of IFRS Accounting Standards.
Internally, we put credit risk exposures into two broad categories: banking products and traded products. Banking 
products include drawn loans, guarantees and loan commitments, amounts due from banks, balances at central banks, 
and other financial assets at amortized cost. Traded products include over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, exchange-traded 
derivatives (ETDs) and securities financing transactions (SFTs), consisting of securities borrowing and lending, and 
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.

1 IFRS 9 gross exposure for banking products includes the following financial assets in scope of expected credit loss measurement: balances at central banks, amounts due from banks, loans and advances to customers, 
other financial assets at amortized cost, guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments. 2 Internal management view of credit risk, which differs in certain respects from IFRS Accounting Standards. 3 As counterparty 
risk for traded products is managed at counterparty level, no further split between exposures in the Investment Bank, Non-core and Legacy, and Group Items is provided. 4 Credit Suisse traded products are presented 
before reflection of the impact of the purchase price allocation performed under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group by UBS. The acquisition date adjustment is less 
than USD 1bn and, if applied, would lead to a reduction in our reported traded products exposure. 5 Unconditionally revocable committed credit lines.

Global Wealth Management
Gross banking products exposure within Global Wealth Management increased by USD 75bn to USD 410bn in 2023 due 
to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
Our Global Wealth Management loan portfolio is mainly secured by securities (Lombard loans) and by residential real 
estate. Most of our USD 182bn of Lombard loans, including traded products collateralized by securities, were of high 
quality, with 93% rated as investment grade based on our internal ratings. Moreover, Lombard loans are typically 
uncommitted, short-term in nature and can be canceled immediately if the collateral quality deteriorates and margin calls 
are not met. Lending values in the Lombard book are derived by applying discounts to the pledged collateral’s market 
value in line with a possible adverse change in market value over a given close-out period and confidence level. Lessliquid or more volatile collateral will typically have larger haircuts. In 2023, the Lombard book, including traded products, 
increased by approximately 19% due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, with no material losses recorded. 
The mortgage book (residential and commercial real estate) increased by approximately 31% due to the acquisition of 
the Credit Suisse Group, mainly driven by higher volumes of mortgage loans within the Swiss residential and commercial 
real estate portfolios.
Other financing represents approximately 12% of the total banking products exposures and is consolidated in a corporate 
and other portfolio that more than doubled in 2023, mainly due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Through 
this acquisition, Other financing now includes ship, yacht and export financing totaling USD 10bn, as well as an expanded 
corporate lending portfolio of USD 5bn.

prioritizes collateral according to its liquidity profile. In the case of loan facilities with funded and unfunded elements, the collateral is first allocated to the funded element. Credit Suisse applies a risk-based approach 
that generally prioritizes real estate collateral and prioritizes other collateral according to its liquidity profile. In the case of loan facilities with funded and unfunded elements, the collateral is proportionately allocated. 
2 Includes but is not limited to life insurance contracts, rights in respect of subscription or capital commitments from fund partners, inventory, gold and other commodities.
Personal & Corporate Banking 
Gross banking products exposure within Personal & Corporate Banking increased by USD 245bn to USD 482bn in 
2023 due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. As illustrated in the “Personal & Corporate Banking: 
distribution of banking products exposure across internal UBS ratings and loss given default (LGD) buckets” table 
below, the majority was classified as investment grade and a significant portion of the exposure is categorized in the 
lowest LGD bucket, i.e., 0–25%. 
As of 31 December 2023, 88% of loans and advances to customers were secured by collateral, mainly residential and 
commercial property. Of the total unsecured amount, 81% related to cash-flow-based lending to corporate 
counterparties and 3% related to lending to public authorities. 
Our Swiss corporate banking products take-and-hold portfolio exposure was USD 93bn (CHF 78bn) and increased by 
USD 57bn compared with 2022 due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. The portfolio consists of loans, 
guarantees and loan commitments to multi-national and domestic counterparties. The small and medium-sized entity 
(SME) portfolio, in particular, is well diversified across industries. However, such companies are reliant on the domestic 
economy and the economies to which they export, in particular the EU and the US.
Our commodity trade finance portfolio focuses on energy and base-metal trading companies, where the related 
commodity price risk is hedged to a large extent by the commodity trader. The majority of limits in this business are 
uncommitted, transactional and short-term in nature. Our portfolio size was USD 11bn (CHF 9bn) as of 31 December 
2023, compared with USD 7bn (CHF 7bn) in 2022, due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. A considerable part 
of the exposure correlates with commodity prices.

Swiss mortgage loan portfolio
Our Swiss mortgage loan portfolio secured by residential and commercial real estate in Switzerland continues to be our 
largest loan portfolio. These mortgage loans (including loans on self-used commercial real estate), totaling USD 352bn 
(CHF 297bn), mainly originate from Personal & Corporate Banking, but also from Global Wealth Management Region 
Switzerland. 
As illustrated in the “Swiss mortgages: distribution of exposure across exposure segments and loan-to-value (LTV) 
buckets” table below, USD 262bn (CHF 220bn) of these mortgage loans related to residential properties that the 
borrower was either occupying or renting out, with full recourse to the borrower. USD 70bn (CHF 59bn) related to 
income-producing real estate. Of the aggregate amount of Swiss residential mortgages, 99.9% would continue to be 
covered by the real estate collateral even if the value assigned to that collateral were to decrease 20%, and more than 
99% would remain covered by the real estate collateral even if the value assigned to that collateral were to decrease 
30%.

1 The amount of each mortgage loan is allocated across the LTV buckets to indicate the portion at risk at the various value levels shown; for example, a loan of 75 with an LTV ratio of 75% (i.e., a collateral value of 
100) would result in allocations of 30 in the less-than-or-equal-to-30% LTV bucket, 20 in the 31–50% bucket, 10 in the 51–60% bucket, 10 in the 61–70% bucket and 5 in the 71–80% bucket. 2 Comparative

Investment Bank
The Investment Bank’s lending activities are largely associated with corporate and non-bank financial institutions. The 
business is broadly diversified across industry sectors but concentrated in North America.
Gross banking products exposure increased by USD 20bn to USD 97bn in 2023 due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse 
Group. As illustrated in the “Investment Bank: distribution of banking products exposure across internal UBS ratings and 
loss given default (LGD) buckets” table below, banking products exposure is approximately equally split between 
investment grade and sub-investment grade and the vast majority had an estimated LGD below 50%.
In the Investment Bank, mandated temporary loan underwriting exposure as of the end of 2023 was USD 2.1bn, 
compared with USD 2.6bn at the end of the prior year. USD 50m of commitments had not yet been distributed as 
originally planned as of 31 December 2023. Loan underwriting exposures are classified as held for trading, with fair 
values reflecting market conditions at the end of 2023.

Non-core and Legacy
Gross banking products exposure in Non-core and Legacy increased by USD 49bn to USD 50bn in 2023, mainly due to 
the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. This included positions and businesses not aligned with the Group’s strategy 
and policies. 
In Non-core and Legacy, mandated temporary loan underwriting exposure as of the end of 2023 was USD 1.0bn. These 
commitments had not yet been distributed as originally planned as of 31 December 2023. Loan underwriting exposures 
are classified as held for trading, with fair values reflecting market conditions at the end of 2023.

Group Items
Gross banking products exposure within Group Items, which arises primarily in connection with treasury activities, 
increased by USD 102bn to USD 139bn in 2023, primarily due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group and an 
increase for UBS AG from Group Treasury reflecting higher levels of high-quality liquid assets held, funding provided to 
Credit Suisse and an increase in sponsored repo clearing.

Traded products
Audited | Counterparty credit risk (CCR) arising from traded products, which include OTC derivatives, ETD exposures and 
SFTs, originating in the Investment Bank, Non-core and Legacy, and Group Treasury, is generally managed on a closeout basis. This takes into account possible effects of market movements on the exposure and any associated collateral 
over the time it would take to close out our positions. Limits are applied to the potential future exposure per counterparty, 
with the size of the limit dependent on the counterparty’s creditworthiness (as determined by Risk Control). Limit 
frameworks are also used to control overall exposure to specific sectors. Such portfolio limits are monitored and reported 
to senior management.
Trading in OTC derivatives is conducted through central counterparties where practicable. Where central counterparties 
are not used, we have clearly defined policies and processes for trading on a bilateral basis. Trading is typically conducted 
under bilateral International Swaps and Derivatives Association or similar master netting agreements, which generally 
allow for close-out and netting of transactions in case of default, subject to applicable law. For certain counterparties, 
initial margin is taken to cover some or all of the calculated close-out exposure. This is in addition to the variation margin 
taken to settle changes in market value of transactions. For most major market participant counterparties, we use twoway collateral agreements under which either party can be required to provide collateral in the form of cash or marketable 
securities when the exposure exceeds specified levels. Non-cash collateral typically consists of well-rated government debt 
or other collateral acceptable to Risk Control and permitted by applicable regulations. Regulations on margining 
uncleared OTC derivatives have generally expanded the scope of bilateral derivatives activity subject to initial margining 
and increased the amounts of initial margin received from, and posted to, certain bilateral trading counterparties, 
resulting in lower close-out risk over time. 
In the tables below, OTC derivatives exposures are generally presented as net positive replacement values after the 
application of legally enforceable netting agreements and the deduction of cash and marketable securities held as 
collateral. SFT exposures are reported taking into account collateral received, and ETD exposures take into account 
collateral margin calls.

Credit risk mitigation
Audited | We actively manage credit risk in our portfolios by taking collateral against exposures and by utilizing credit 
hedging. 
Lending secured by real estate
Audited | We use a scoring model as part of a standardized front-to-back process for credit decisions on originating or 
modifying Swiss mortgage loans. The model’s two key factors are the LTV ratio and an affordability calculation. 
The calculation of affordability takes into account interest payments, minimum amortization requirements and potential 
property maintenance costs in relation to gross income or rental income for rental properties. The imputed interest rate 
is set at 5% per annum, independently of the current interest rate environment.
For residential properties occupied by the borrower, the maximum LTV for the standard approval process is 80%. For 
income-producing real estate (IPRE), the maximum LTV allowed within the standard approval process ranges from 30–
75%, depending on the type and age of the property, and the amount of renovation work needed. 
Audited | The value we assign to each property is based on the lowest value determined from model-derived valuations, the 
purchase price, an asset value for IPRE, and, in some cases, an additional external valuation. 
Separate models provided by a market-leading external vendor are used to derive property valuations for owner-occupied 
residential properties (ORPs) and IPRE. We estimate the current value of an ORP using regression models (hedonic models) 
based on statistical comparison against current transaction data. We derive the value of a property from the characteristics 
of the real estate itself, as well as those of its location. In addition to the initial valuation, values for ORPs are updated 
regularly over the lifetime of the loan using region-specific real estate price indices or hedonic valuation. The price indices 
are sourced from external vendors and subject to internal benchmarking. We use these valuations regularly to compute 
indexed LTV for all ORPs. Portfolio-specific monitoring systems consider these along with other risk measures (e.g., rating 
and behavioral information) to identify higher-risk loans.
For IPRE, the capitalization rate model is used to determine the property valuation by discounting estimated sustainable 
future income using a capitalization rate based on various attributes. These attributes consider regional and specific 
property characteristics, such as market and location data (e.g., vacancy rates), benchmarks (e.g., for running costs), and 
certain other standardized input parameters (e.g., property condition). Updated information regarding rental income 
from IPRE is requested from the client at least once every three years. Our portfolio-specific monitoring system alerts us 
to changes in rental income and other risk measures (e.g., LTV, rating, behavioral information).
To take market developments into account for these models, the external vendor regularly updates the parameters and 
/ or refines the architecture for each model. Model changes and parameter updates are subject to the same validation 
procedures as our internally developed models. 
Audited | We similarly apply underwriting guidelines for our Global Wealth Management Region Americas mortgage loan 
portfolio, taking into account loan affordability and collateral sufficiency. LTV standards are defined for the various 
mortgage types, such as residential mortgages or investment properties, based on associated risk factors, such as property 
type, loan size, and purpose. The maximum LTV allowed within the standard approval process ranges from 45–80%. In 
addition to LTV, other credit risk metrics, such as debt-to-income ratios, credit scores and required client reserves, are 
also part of our underwriting guidelines.
A risk limit framework is applied to the Global Wealth Management Region Americas mortgage loan portfolio. Limits are 
set to govern exposures within LTV categories, geographic concentrations, portfolio growth and high-risk mortgage 
segments, such as interest-only loans. These limits are monitored by a specialized credit risk monitoring team and reported 
to senior management. Supplementing this limit framework is a real estate lending policy and procedures framework, 
set up to govern real estate lending activities. Quality assurance and quality control programs monitor compliance with 
mortgage underwriting and documentation requirements.
For our mortgage loan portfolio in the Global Wealth Management regions of EMEA and Asia Pacific, we apply global 
underwriting guidelines with regional variations to allow for regulatory and market differentials. As in other regions, the 
underwriting guidelines take into account affordability and collateral sufficiency. Affordability is assessed at a stressed 
interest rate using, for residential real estate, the borrowers’ sustainable income and declared liabilities, and for 
commercial real estate the quality and sustainability of rental income. For interest-only loans, a declared and evidenced 
repayment strategy must be in place. The applicable LTV for each mortgage is based on the quality and liquidity of the 
property and assessed against valuations from bank-appointed third-party valuers. Maximum LTV varies from 30% to 
70%, depending on the type and location of the property, as well as other factors. Collateral sufficiency is often further 
supported by personal guarantees from related third parties. The overall portfolio is centrally assessed against a number 
of stress scenarios to ensure that exposures remain within predefined stress limits. 

Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 119
Lombard lending 
Audited | Lombard loans are secured by pledges of marketable securities, guarantees and other forms of collateral. Eligible 
financial securities are primarily liquid and actively traded transferable securities (such as bonds and equities), and other 
transferable securities, such as approved structured products for which regular prices are available and the issuer of the 
security provides a market. To a lesser degree, less-liquid collateral is also used.
We derive lending values by applying discounts (haircuts) to the pledged collateral’s market value. Haircuts for marketable 
securities are calculated to cover a possible adverse change in market value over a given close-out period and confidence 
level. Less-liquid or more volatile collateral will typically have larger haircuts.
We assess concentration and correlation risks across collateral posted at a counterparty level, and at a divisional level 
across counterparties. We also perform targeted Group-wide reviews of concentration. Concentration of collateral in 
single securities, issuers or issuer groups, industry sectors, countries, regions or currencies may result in higher risk and 
reduced liquidity. In such cases, the lending value of the collateral, margin call and close-out levels are adjusted 
accordingly. 
Exposures and collateral market values are monitored daily, with the aim of ensuring that the credit exposure is always 
within the established risk tolerance. A shortfall occurs when the lending value drops below the exposure; if it exceeds a 
defined trigger level, a margin call is initiated, requiring the client to provide additional collateral, reduce the exposure or 
take other action to bring exposure in line with the agreed lending value of the collateral. If a shortfall is not corrected 
within the required period, a close-out is initiated, through which collateral is liquidated, open derivative positions are 
closed and guarantees are called.
We conduct stress testing of collateralized exposures to simulate market events that reduce collateral market value, 
increase exposure of traded products, or do both. For certain classes of counterparties, limits on such calculated stress 
exposures are applied and controlled at a counterparty level. Also, portfolio limits are applied across certain businesses 
or collateral types. 
› Refer to “Stress loss” in this section for more information about our stress testing
Credit hedging
Audited | We use single-name credit default swaps (CDSs), credit-index CDSs, structured hedging, bespoke protection and 
other instruments to actively manage credit risk. The aim is to reduce concentrations of risk from specific counterparties, 
sectors or portfolios and, for CCR, the profit or loss effect arising from changes in credit valuation adjustments.
We have strict guidelines with regard to taking credit hedges into account for credit risk mitigation purposes. For example, 
when monitoring exposures against counterparty limits, we do not usually apply certain credit risk mitigants, such as 
proxy hedges (credit protection on a correlated but different name) or credit-index CDSs, to reduce counterparty 
exposures. Buying credit protection also creates credit exposure with regard to the protection provider. We monitor and 
limit exposures to credit protection providers, and also monitor the effectiveness of credit hedges as part of our overall 
credit exposures to the relevant counterparties, which are typically collateralized. For credit protection purchased to hedge 
the lending portfolio, this includes monitoring mismatches between the maturity of credit protection purchased and the 
maturity of the associated loan. Such mismatches result in basis risk and may reduce the effectiveness of the credit 
protection. Mismatches are routinely reported to credit officers and mitigating actions are taken when necessary. 
› Refer to “Note 11 Derivative instruments” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report for more information
Mitigation of settlement risk
To mitigate settlement risk, we reduce actual settlement volumes by using multi-lateral and bi-lateral agreements with 
counterparties, including payment netting. In relation to the exchange of cash or securities, transactions can be settled 
on a delivery-versus-payment basis.
Foreign exchange transactions are our most significant source of settlement risk. We are a member of Continuous Linked 
Settlement (CLS), an industry utility that provides a multi-lateral framework to settle transactions on a payment-versuspayment basis, thus reducing foreign-exchange-related settlement risk relative to the volume of business. However, 
mitigation of settlement risk through CLS and other means does not fully eliminate credit risk in foreign exchange 
transactions resulting from changes in exchange rates prior to settlement, which is managed as part of our overall credit 
risk management of OTC derivatives. 
Credit risk models
Basel III – A-IRB credit risk models
Audited | We have developed tools and models to estimate future credit losses that may be implicit in our current portfolio.
Exposures to individual counterparties are measured using three generally accepted parameters: PD, EAD and LGD. For a 
given credit facility, the product of these three parameters results in the expected loss (the EL). These parameters are the 
basis for the majority of our internal measures of credit risk, and key inputs for regulatory capital calculation under the 
advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approach of the Basel III framework. We also use models to derive the portfolio 
credit risk measures of EL, statistical loss and stress loss. 
› Refer to the 31 December 2023 Pillar 3 Report, available under “Pillar 3 disclosures” at ubs.com/investors, for more information


Probability of default
Probability of default (PD) estimates the likelihood of a counterparty defaulting on its contractual obligations over the next 
12 months and is assessed using rating tools tailored to the various categories of counterparties. The “Key features of 
our main credit risk models” table above gives an overview of the approaches used for our main asset classes and presents 
the main drivers of the PD. 
The ratings of major credit rating agencies, and their mapping to the UBS masterscale and internal PD bands, are shown 
in the “Internal UBS rating scale and mapping of external ratings” table above. For Moody’s and S&P, the mapping is 
based on the long-term average of one-year default rates available from these rating agencies, with Fitch ratings being 
mapped to the equivalent S&P ratings. For each external rating category, the average default rate is compared with our 
internal PD bands to derive a periodically reviewed mapping to our internal rating scale.
Exposure at default
Exposure at default (EAD) is the amount we expect to be owed by a counterparty at the time of possible default. We 
derive EAD from current exposure to the counterparty and possible future exposure development.
The EAD of an on-balance sheet loan is its notional amount, while for off-balance sheet commitments that are not drawn, 
credit conversion factors (CCFs) are used in order to obtain an expected on-balance sheet amount.
For traded products, we derive EAD by modeling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using a 
simulation based on a scenario-consistent technique. We assess the net amount that may be owed to us or that we may 
owe to others, taking into account the effect of market movements over the potential time it would take to close out 
positions. 
We assess exposures where there is a material correlation between the factors driving the credit quality of the 
counterparty and those driving the potential future value of our traded products exposure (wrong-way risk), and we have 
established specific controls to mitigate such risks. 
Loss given default
Loss given default (LGD) is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. Our LGD estimates, which consider 
downturn conditions, include loss of principal, interest and other amounts less recovered amounts. We determine LGD 
based on the likely recovery rate of claims against defaulted counterparties, which depends on the type of counterparty 
and any credit mitigation due to collateral or guarantees. Our estimates are supported by internal loss data and external 
information, where available. If we hold collateral, such as marketable securities or a mortgage on a property, LTV ratios 
are typically a key parameter in determining LGD. For risk-weighted asset (RWA) calculation, floors are applied to LGD in 
line with regulation.
Expected loss
We use the concept of expected loss to quantify future credit losses that may be implicit in our current portfolio. The 
expected loss for a given credit facility is a product of the three components described above, i.e., PD, EAD and LGD. We 
aggregate the expected loss for individual counterparties to derive expected portfolio credit losses.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 122
IFRS 9 – ECL credit risk models
Expected credit loss 
Expected credit loss (ECL) is defined as the difference between contractual cash flows and those UBS expects to receive, 
discounted at the effective interest rate (EIR) or contractual interest rate. For loan commitments and other credit facilities 
in scope of ECL requirements, expected cash shortfalls are determined by considering expected future drawdowns. Rather 
than focusing on an average through-the-cycle (TTC) expected annual loss, the purpose of ECL is to estimate the amount 
of losses inherent in a portfolio based on current conditions and future outlook (a point-in-time (PIT) measure), whereby 
such a forecast has to include all information available without undue cost and effort, and address multiple scenarios 
where there is perceived non-linearity between changes in economic conditions and their effect on credit losses. From a 
credit risk modeling perspective, ECL parameters are generally derivations of the factors assessed for regulatory Basel III 
EL.
Comparison of Basel III EL and IFRS 9 ECL credit risk models
The IFRS 9 ECL concept has a number of key differences from our Basel III credit risk models, both in the loss estimation 
process and the result thereof. Most notably, regulatory Basel III EL parameters are TTC / downturn estimates, which 
might include a margin of conservatism, while IFRS 9 ECL parameters are typically PIT, reflecting current economic 
conditions and future outlook. The table below summarizes the main differences. Stage 1 and 2 ECL expenses in 2023 
were USD 593m and respective allowances and provisions as of 31 December 2023 were USD 1,115m. This included 
ECL allowances and provisions of USD 923m related to positions under the Basel III advanced internal ratings-based 
(A-IRB) approach. Basel III EL for non-defaulted positions was USD 1,620m.
› Refer to “Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report for 
more information about our accounting policy for allowances and provisions for ECL including key definitions relevant for the ECL 
calculation under IFRS 9
The table below shows the main differences between the two expected loss measures.
Basel III EL (advanced internal ratings-based approach) IFRS 9 ECL
Scope The Basel III A-IRB approach applies to most credit risk 
exposures. It includes transactions measured at amortized 
cost, at fair value through profit or loss and at fair value 
through OCI, including loan commitments and financial 
guarantees.
The IFRS 9 ECL calculation mainly applies to financial assets 
measured at amortized cost and debt instruments measured at fair 
value through OCI, as well as loan commitments and financial 
guarantees not at fair value through profit or loss.
12-month versus 
lifetime expected 
loss
The Basel III A-IRB approach takes into account expected 
losses resulting from expected default events occurring 
within the next 12 months.
In the absence of a significant increase in credit risk (an SICR), a 
maximum 12-month ECL is recognized to reflect lifetime cash 
shortfalls that will result if a default event occurs in the 12 months 
after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected lifetime 
is less). Once an SICR event has occurred, a lifetime ECL is 
recognized considering expected default events over the life of the 
transaction.
Exposure at default
(EAD)
EAD is the amount we expect a counterparty to owe us at 
the time of a possible default. For banking products, EAD 
equals the book value as of the reporting date; for traded 
products, the vast majority of EAD is modeled. For lending, 
EAD is expected to remain constant over a 12-month period. 
For loan commitments, a credit conversion factor is applied 
to model expected future drawdowns over the 12-month 
period, irrespective of the actual maturity of a particular 
transaction. The credit conversion factor includes downturn 
adjustments.
EAD is generally calculated on the basis of the cash flows that are 
expected to be outstanding at the individual points in time during 
the life of the transaction. For loan commitments, a credit 
conversion factor is applied to model expected future drawdowns 
over the life of the transaction without including downturn 
assumptions and the prepayment factor. In both cases, the time 
period is capped at 12 months, unless an SICR has occurred.
Probability of 
default
(PD)
PD estimates are determined on a through-the-cycle (TTC) 
basis. They represent historical average PDs, taking into 
account observed losses over a prolonged historical period, 
and therefore are less sensitive to movements in the 
underlying economy.
PD estimates will be determined on a point-in-time (PIT) basis, 
based on current conditions and incorporating forecasts for future 
economic conditions at the reporting date.
Loss given default
(LGD)
LGD includes prudential adjustments, such as downturn LGD 
assumptions and floors. Similar to PD, LGD is determined on 
a TTC basis.
LGD should reflect the losses that are reasonably expected and 
prudential adjustments should therefore not be applied. Similar to 
PD, LGD is determined on the basis of a PIT approach.
Use of scenarios n / a Multiple forward-looking scenarios have to be taken into account 
to determine a probability-weighted ECL.
Further key aspects of credit risk models
Stress loss
We complement our statistical modeling approach with scenario-based stress loss measures. Stress tests are run regularly 
to monitor potential effects of extreme, but nevertheless plausible, events on our portfolios, under which key credit risk 
parameters are assumed to deteriorate substantially. Where we consider it appropriate, we apply limits on this basis.
Stress scenarios and methodologies are tailored to portfolios’ natures, ranging from regionally focused to global systemic 
events, and varying in time horizon.
› Refer to “Stress testing” in this section for more information about our stress testing framework
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 123
Credit risk model confirmation
Our approach to model confirmation involves both quantitative methods, such as monitoring compositional changes in 
portfolios and results of backtesting, and qualitative assessments, such as feedback from users on model output as a 
practical indicator of a model’s performance and reliability. In addition, changes in market, regulatory and business 
practices are assessed.
Material changes in portfolio composition may invalidate the conceptual soundness of a model. We therefore perform 
regular analyses of the evolution of portfolios to identify such changes in the structure and credit quality of portfolios. 
› Refer to “Model risk management” in this section for more information 
Backtesting
We monitor the performance of models by backtesting and benchmarking them, with model outcomes compared with 
actual results, based on our internal experience and externally observed results. To assess the predictive power of credit 
exposure models for traded products, such as OTC derivatives and ETD products, we statistically compare predicted future 
exposure distributions at different forecast horizons with realized values. 
For PD, we derive a predicted distribution of the number of defaults. The observed number of defaults is compared with 
the upper tail of the predicted distribution. If the observed number of defaults is higher than a given upper tail quantile, 
we conclude there is evidence that the model may underpredict the number of defaults. Based on historical long-run 
average default rates and, if required, additional margin of conservatism, we also derive PD calibration targets and a 
lower boundary. As a general rule, follow-up actions, such as a recalibration of the rating tool, are defined if the portfolio 
average PD lies below the derived lower boundary. 
For LGD, backtesting statistically tests whether the mean difference between the observed and predicted LGD is zero. If 
the test fails, there is evidence that our predicted LGD is too low. In such cases, and where these differences are outside 
expectations, follow-up actions, such as a recalibration of the models, are taken. 
CCFs, used for the calculation of EAD for undrawn facilities, are dependent on several credit facility contractual 
dimensions. We compare the predicted amount drawn with observed historical use of such facilities by defaulted 
counterparties. If any statistically significant deviation is observed, follow-up actions, such as an update of the relevant 
CCFs, are performed.
Changes to models and model parameters during the period
As part of our continuous efforts to enhance models to reflect market developments and newly available data, we 
updated several models in 2023.
In Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management for UBS AG’s models, we recalibrated the risk 
parameters for the income-producing real estate mortgages in Switzerland and implemented a model update for the 
Swiss corporate PD model. In addition, we recalibrated the PD and LGD models for the commodity trade finance business 
within Personal & Corporate Banking and updated the LGD model for corporate clients and financial institutions. In 
Global Wealth Management, we also implemented a model update for the standard Lombard model. 
In the Investment Bank, new PD models for UBS AG for banks, corporations, insurance companies and managed funds 
went live. In addition, certain RWA multipliers were recalibrated as a result of improvements to models. 
Within Credit Suisse, updated models for the Swiss income-producing real estate portfolio (IPRE LGD, private client IPRE 
PD and corporate client IPRE PD) were rolled out. In addition, dedicated A-IRB models were introduced for the Swisscard 
credit card portfolio, as well as the BANK-now consumer loans and car leasing portfolios, which had previously been 
treated on a pooled basis.
Where required, changes to models and model parameters were approved by FINMA before being made.

information about the effect of the changes to models and model parameters on credit risk RWA
Future credit risk-related regulatory capital developments
In December 2017, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) announced the finalization of the Basel III 
framework. In November 2023, the Swiss Federal Council published the national implementation of the final Basel III 
standards, which is expected to enter into force by January 2025. The updated framework makes a number of revisions 
to the internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches, namely: (i) removing the option of using the A-IRB approach for certain 
asset classes (including large and medium-sized corporate clients, and banks and other financial institutions); (ii) placing 
floors on certain model inputs under the IRB approach, e.g., PD and LGD; and (iii) introducing various requirements to 
reduce RWA variability (e.g., for LGD). In addition, revisions to the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) framework were 
published in November 2023, including the removal of the advanced CVA approach. UBS has a close dialogue with 
FINMA to discuss in detail the implementation objectives and prepare for a smooth transition of the capital regime for 
credit risk.

Credit policies for distressed assets
Non-performing
Audited | In line with the regulatory definition, we report a claim as non-performing when: (i) it is more than 90 days past 
due; (ii) it is subject to restructuring proceedings, where preferential conditions concerning interest rates, subordination, 
tenor, etc. have been granted in order to avoid default of the counterparty (forbearance); (iii) the counterparty is subject 
to bankruptcy / enforced liquidation proceedings in any form, even if there is sufficient collateral to cover the due 
payment; or (iv) there is other evidence that payment obligations will not be fully met without recourse to collateral.
Default and credit-impaired 
UBS uses a single definition of default for classifying assets and determining the PD of its obligors for risk modeling 
purposes. The definition of default is based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. A counterparty is classified as 
defaulted when material payments of interest, principal or fees are overdue for more than 90 days, or more than 180 
days for certain exposures in relation to loans to private and commercial clients in Personal & Corporate Banking and to 
private clients of Global Wealth Management Region Switzerland. UBS does not consider the general 90-day presumption 
for default recognition appropriate for those portfolios, given the cure rates, which show that strict application of the 
90-day criterion would not accurately reflect the inherent credit risk. Counterparties are also classified as defaulted when: 
bankruptcy, insolvency proceedings or enforced liquidation have commenced; obligations have been restructured on 
preferential terms (forbearance); or there is other evidence that payment obligations will not be fully met without recourse 
to collateral. The latter may be the case even if, to date, all contractual payments have been made when due. If one claim 
against a counterparty is defaulted on, generally all claims against the counterparty are treated as defaulted.
An instrument is classified as credit-impaired if the counterparty is classified as defaulted and / or the instrument is 
identified as purchased credit-impaired (PCI). An instrument is PCI if it has been purchased at a deep discount to its 
carrying amount following a risk event of the issuer or originated with a defaulted counterparty. Once a financial asset 
is classified as defaulted / credit-impaired (except PCI), it is reported as a stage 3 instrument and remains as such unless 
all past due amounts have been rectified, additional payments have been made on time, the position is not classified as 
credit-restructured, and there is general evidence of credit recovery. A three-month probation period is applied before a 
transfer back to stages 1 or 2 can be triggered. However, most instruments remain in stage 3 for a longer period. 
Forbearance (credit restructuring) 
Audited | If payment default is imminent or default has already occurred, we may grant concessions to borrowers in financial 
difficulties that we would otherwise not consider in the normal course of business, such as offering preferential interest 
rates, extending maturity, modifying the schedule of repayments, debt / equity swap, subordination, etc. When a 
forbearance measure takes place, each case is considered individually and the exposure is generally classified as defaulted. 
Forbearance classification remains until the loan is repaid or written off, non-preferential conditions are granted that 
supersede the preferential conditions, or the counterparty has recovered and the preferential conditions no longer exceed 
our risk tolerance.
Contractual adjustments when there is no evidence of imminent payment default, or where changes to terms and 
conditions are within our usual risk tolerance, are not considered to be forborne. 
Loss history statistics
An instrument is classified as credit-impaired if the counterparty has defaulted. This also includes credit-impaired 
exposures for which no loss has occurred or for which no allowance has been recognized (e.g., we expect to fully recover 
the exposures via collateral held). 
Coverage ratios are calculated for the core loan portfolio by taking ECL allowances and provisions divided by the gross 
carrying amount of the exposures. Core loan exposure is defined as the sum of Loans and advances to customers and 
Loans to financial advisors. 
The total combined on- and off-balance sheet coverage ratio was at 22 basis points as of 31 December 2023, 1 basis 
point higher than on 31 December 2022. The combined stage 1 and 2 ratio of 11 basis points was 1 basis point higher 
than on 31 December 2022; the stage 3 ratio was 21%, 1 percentage point lower than on 31 December 2022 and PCI 
ratio was 7%.
› The majority of the credit-impaired exposure relates to loans and advances in our Swiss domestic business. Refer to “Note 10

Market risk 
Audited | Main sources of market risk 
Market risks arise from both trading and non-trading business activities.
– Trading market risks are primarily in the Investment Bank, Non-core and Legacy and, to a lesser extent, Global Wealth 
Management. In the Investment Bank, these risks are mainly connected with primary debt and equity underwriting, as 
well as securities and derivatives trading for market-making and client facilitation. In Non-core and Legacy market risks 
are mainly from structured trades, large portfolios of loans and securitized products and both complex and simple 
credit, interest rate and equity derivative transactions. In Global Wealth Management, they are from our municipal 
securities trading business.
– Non-trading market risks arise predominantly in the form of interest rate and foreign exchange risks connected with 
personal banking and lending in our wealth management businesses, the Swiss business of our Personal & Corporate 
Banking business division, the Investment Bank’s lending business, and treasury activities.
– Group Treasury assumes market risks in the process of managing interest rate risk, structural foreign exchange risk 
and the Group’s liquidity and funding profile, including high-quality liquid assets (HQLA).
– Equity and debt investments can also give rise to market risks, as can some aspects of employee benefits, such as 
defined benefit pension schemes. 
Audited | Overview of measurement, monitoring and management techniques 
– Market risk limits are set for the Group, the business divisions and Group Treasury at granular levels in the various 
business lines, reflecting the nature and magnitude of the market risks.
– Management value-at-risk (VaR) measures exposures under the market risk framework, including trading market risks 
and some non-trading market risks. Non-trading market risks not included in VaR are also covered in the risks 
controlled by Market and Treasury Risk Control functions.
– Our primary portfolio measures of market risk are liquidity-adjusted stress loss and VaR. Both are subject to limits that 
are approved by the Board of Directors (the BoD). Market risk measurement for Credit Suisse portfolios can differ from 
UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse, as set out below. 
– These measures are complemented by concentration and granular limits for general and specific market risk factors. 
Our trading businesses are subject to multiple market risk limits, which take into account the extent of market liquidity 
and volatility, available operational capacity, valuation uncertainty, and, for our single-name exposures, issuer credit 
quality.
– Trading market risks are managed at portfolio level. As risk factor sensitivities change due to new transactions, 
transaction expiries or changes in market levels, risk factors are dynamically rehedged to remain within limits. We do 
not generally seek to distinguish in the trading portfolio between specific positions and associated hedges.
– Issuer risk is controlled by limits applied at the business division level based on jump-to-zero measures, which estimate 
maximum default exposure (the default event loss assuming zero recovery).
– Non-trading foreign exchange risks are managed under market risk limits, with the exception of Group Treasury 
management of consolidated capital activity. 
Our CRO Treasury function applies a holistic risk framework, setting the appetite for treasury-related risk-taking activities 
across the Group. Key elements of the framework include an overarching regulatory (interest rate risk in the banking 
book, IRRBB) delta economic value of equity (EVE) target, set by the BoD. Limits are also set by the BoD to balance the 
effect of foreign exchange movements on our common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and CET1 capital ratio. Non-trading 
interest rate and foreign exchange risks are included in Group-wide statistical and stress-testing metrics, which flow into 
our risk appetite framework.
Equity and debt investments are subject to a range of risk controls, including preapproval of new investments by business 
management and Risk Control and regular monitoring and reporting. They are also included in Group-wide statistical 
and stress-testing metrics. 

Market risk stress loss
The measurement and management of market risks include an extensive set of stress tests and scenario analyses, 
continuously evaluated to ensure that losses resulting from an extreme yet plausible event do not exceed our risk appetite.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 127
Liquidity-adjusted stress
Liquidity-adjusted stress is our primary stress loss measure for Group-wide market risk. The framework captures the 
economic losses that could arise under specified stress scenarios. Shocks are applied to positions based on expected 
market movements in the liquidity-adjusted holding periods resulting from the specified scenario.
The holding periods used for liquidity-adjusted stress are calibrated to reflect the time needed to reduce or hedge the 
risk of positions in each major risk factor in a stressed environment. We apply minimum holding periods, regardless of 
observed liquidity levels, as identification of and reaction to a crisis may not always be immediate.
The expected market movements are derived using historical market behavior (based on analysis of historical events) and 
forward-looking analysis including consideration of defined scenarios that have not occurred in the past.
Stress-based limits apply at several levels of the organizational hierarchy. Liquidity-adjusted stress is also the core market 
risk component of our combined stress test framework and therefore integral to our overall risk appetite framework.

Value-at-risk
VaR definition
Audited | VaR is a statistical measure of market risk, quantifying the potential market risk losses over a set time horizon 
(holding period) at an established level of confidence. VaR assumes no change in the Group’s trading positions over the 
set time horizon.
We calculate VaR daily. The profit or loss distribution from which VaR is estimated is derived from our internally developed 
VaR model, which simulates returns over the holding period for risk factors our trading positions are sensitive to, and 
subsequently quantifies the profit / loss effect of these risk factor returns on our trading positions. Systematic commodity, 
credit, equity, foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk factor returns are based on a pure historical simulation 
approach. UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse uses an unweighted five-year look-back window, and Credit Suisse uses 
an exponentially weighted two-year window. Modeling idiosyncratic and specific risks for equity and credit risk factors 
using historical simulation is challenging, due to the limited availability of continuous good-quality historical data. 
Wherever possible, Credit Suisse uses historical simulation to model specific risk; however, both UBS Group excluding 
Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse rely upon factor models to distinguish systematic and idiosyncratic returns. UBS Group 
excluding Credit Suisse simulates idiosyncratic returns through a Monte Carlo simulation, aggregating the sum of 
systematic and residual returns in such a way that systematic and residual risk are consistently captured. Credit Suisse 
uses the available distribution of idiosyncratic returns to determine an extreme scenario for a given risk factor’s specific 
risk. The resultant Credit Suisse VaR and extreme scenario loss for a given risk factor are aggregated using a zerocorrelation assumption. Correlations among risk factors are implicitly captured via historical simulation approaches. When 
modeling risk factor returns, we consider the stationarity properties of the historical time series of risk factor changes. 
Depending on the stationarity properties of the risk factors within a given factor class, the factor returns are modeled 
using absolute returns, proportional or logarithmic returns. Risk factor return distributions are updated fortnightly for 
UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse and weekly for Credit Suisse.
Risk factor returns are converted into profit or loss values via sensitivities and full revaluation grids sourced from frontoffice systems, enabling us to capture material non-linear effects. Credit Suisse uses full revaluation models for its financial 
products that are materially sensitive to the risks of co-factor movements (e.g., basket options). Both UBS Group excluding 
Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse use VaR models for internal management purposes and for determining market risk riskweighted assets (RWA), although the two use cases consider different confidence levels and time horizons. For internal 
management purposes, risk limits are established and exposures measured using VaR at a 95% confidence level for UBS 
Group excluding Credit Suisse and 98% for Credit Suisse, with a 1-day holding period, aligned to the way we consider 
the risks associated with our trading activities. The regulatory measure of market risk used to underpin the market risk 
capital requirements under Basel III involves a measure equivalent to a 99% confidence level using a 10-day holding 
period. To calculate a 10-day holding period VaR, we use 10-day risk factor returns.
Additionally, the portfolio populations for management and regulatory VaR are slightly different. The one for regulatory 
VaR meets regulatory requirements for inclusion in regulatory VaR. Management VaR includes a broader range of 
positions. For example, regulatory VaR excludes credit spread risks from the securitization portfolio, which are treated 
instead under the securitization approach for regulatory purposes.
We also use stressed VaR (SVaR) for the calculation of market risk RWA. SVaR uses broadly the same methodology as 
regulatory VaR and is calculated using the same population, holding period (10-day) and confidence level (99%). For 
SVaR, both UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse identify the most significant one-year period of financial 
stress from a historical dataset covering the period from 1 January 2007 to the present. SVaR is computed at least once 
a week. 

Management VaR for the period
UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse continued to maintain management VaR at low levels, with average VaR increasing 
to USD 15m from USD 11m in 2023, mainly driven by the Investment Bank’s Global Markets business.
Credit Suisse’s average management VaR stood at USD 29m as of the end of 2023, decreasing in the second half of 
2023 due to continued strategic migration of positions to UBS and de-risking within Non-core and Legacy.

1 Statistics at individual levels may not be summed to deduce the corresponding aggregate figures. The minima and maxima for each level may occur on different days, and, likewise, the value-at-risk (VaR) for each 
business line or risk type, being driven by the extreme loss tail of the corresponding distribution of simulated profits and losses for that business line or risk type, may well be driven by different days in the historical 
time series, rendering invalid the simple summation of figures to arrive at the aggregate total. 2 The difference between the sum of the standalone VaR for the business divisions and Group Items and the total VaR. 
3 As the minima and maxima for different business divisions and Group Items occur on different days, it is not meaningful to calculate a portfolio diversification effect. 4 In the second quarter of 2023, Credit Suisse 
AG consolidated introduced an enhanced approach to measure management VaR for individual risk types. The enhanced approach is applied to each risk type using a collection of risk factors included within the 
respective risk type only, ignoring the cross-risk effects. This change in the measurement approach for individual risk types particularly affected standalone management VaR for equity risk and foreign exchange risk, 
with no impact on the total management VaR. 5 Non-core and Legacy management VaR consists of exposures of the previously reported Capital Release Unit (Credit Suisse) and Investment Bank (Credit Suisse).

VaR limitations
Audited | Actual realized market risk losses may differ from those implied by VaR for a variety of reasons.
– VaR is calibrated to a specified level of confidence and may not indicate potential losses beyond this confidence level.
– The 1-day time horizon used for VaR for internal management purposes (10-day for regulatory VaR) may not fully 
capture market risk of positions that cannot be closed out or hedged within the specified period.
– In some cases, VaR calculations approximate the effect of changes in risk factors on the values of positions and 
portfolios. 
– Effects of extreme market movements are subject to estimation errors, which may result from non-linear risk 
sensitivities, and the potential for actual volatility and correlation levels to differ from assumptions implicit in VaR 
calculations.
– The choice of a longer historical window means sudden increases in market volatility will tend not to increase VaR as 
quickly as the use of shorter historical observation periods, but such increases will affect VaR for a longer period of 
time. Similarly, after periods of increased volatility, as markets stabilize, VaR predictions will remain more conservative 
for a period of time influenced by the length of the historical observation period. 
SVaR is subject to the limitations noted for VaR above, but the use of one-year datasets avoids the smoothing effect of 
longer datasets used for VaR. In addition, the ability to select a one-year period outside of recent market history allows 
for a wider variety of potential loss events. Therefore, although the significant period of stress during the 2007–2009 
financial crisis is no longer contained in the look-back window used for management and regulatory VaR, SVaR continues 
to use that data. This approach aims to reduce the procyclicality of the regulatory capital requirements for market risks.
We recognize that no single measure can encompass all risks associated with a position or portfolio. We use a set of 
metrics with both overlapping and complementary characteristics to create a holistic framework that aims to ensure 
material completeness of risk identification and measurement. As a statistical aggregate risk measure, VaR supplements 
our comprehensive stress-testing framework.
We also have a framework to identify and quantify potential risks not fully captured by our VaR model and refer to such 
risks as risks not in VaR. The framework underpins these potential risks with additional regulatory capital. 
Backtesting of VaR
VaR backtesting is a performance measurement process in which a 1-day VaR prediction is compared with the realized 
1-day profit or loss (P&L). We compute backtesting VaR using a 99% confidence level and 1-day holding period for the 
regulatory VaR population. Since 99% VaR at UBS is defined as a risk measure that operates on the lower tail of the P&L 
distribution, 99% backtesting VaR is a negative number. Backtesting revenues exclude non-trading revenues, such as 
valuation reserves, fees and commissions, and revenues from intraday trading, so as to provide a like-for-like comparison. 
A backtesting exception occurs when backtesting revenues are lower than the previous day’s backtesting VaR.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 130
Statistically, given the 99% confidence level, two or three backtesting exceptions a year can be expected. More than four 
exceptions could indicate that the VaR model is not performing appropriately, as could too few exceptions over a long 
period. However, as noted for VaR limitations above, a sudden increase (or decrease) in market volatility relative to the 
volatility observed in the look-back window could lead to a higher (or lower) number of exceptions. Therefore, Grouplevel backtesting exceptions are investigated, as are exceptional positive backtesting revenues, with the results reported 
to senior business management and regulators.
For UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse, the number of negative backtesting exceptions within a 250-business-day 
window decreased to zero at the end of 2023 from one at the end of 2022. For Credit Suisse, the number of negative 
backtesting exceptions within a 250-business-day window increased to three at the end of 2023 from one at the end of 
2022.
The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) VaR multiplier derived from backtesting exceptions for market 
risk RWA was unchanged compared with 2022, at 3.0, for both UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse.
VaR model confirmation
In addition to the for-regulatory-purposes backtesting described above, we conduct extended backtesting for internal 
model confirmation purposes. This includes observing model performance across the entire P&L distribution (not just the 
tails) and at multiple levels within the business division hierarchies.

VaR model developments in 2023
Audited | In the fourth quarter of 2023, we amended the Credit Suisse credit spread VaR model by significantly enhancing 
the coverage of single-name-issuer bond and CDS spread curves. Although the model change is considered significant 
from a risk management perspective, the quantitative impact on risk management VaR was not material. No material 
changes were made to UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse VaR model in 2023. 
Future market risk-related regulatory capital developments 
In January 2019, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) published the final standards on the minimum 
capital requirements for market risk (the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book). In December 2022, the Swiss State 
Secretariat for International Finance changed the expected date on which the final Basel III guidelines are to enter into 
force, from 1 July 2024 to 1 January 2025. As a result, the Swiss implementation timeline would be aligned to the 
currently expected implementation timeline in the EU. In November 2023, the Swiss Federal Council adopted 
amendments to the Capital Adequacy Ordinance (the CAO) for banks to incorporate the final Basel III standards adopted 
by the BCBS in Swiss law. The Federal Department of Finance (FDF) will inform the Federal Council again about the status 
of international implementation by the end of July 2024.
Key elements of the revised market risk framework include: (i) changes to the internal model-based approach, including 
changes to the model approval and performance measurement process; (ii) changes to the standardized approach with 
the aim of it being a credible fallback method for an internal model-based approach; and (iii) a revised boundary between 
the trading book and the banking book. UBS maintains a close dialogue with FINMA to discuss the implementation 
objectives in more detail and to provide a smooth transition of the capital regime for market risk.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 131
In September 2021, FINMA mandated UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse to hold an RWA add-on for the omission of 
time decay in regulatory VaR and SVaR. The add-on reflects the outcome of discussions with FINMA, which started in 
late 2019. The integration of time decay into the regulatory VaR model for UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse, which 
would replace the add-on, went live in January 2024.

Interest rate risk in the banking book
Sources of interest rate risk in the banking book 
Audited | IRRBB arises from balance sheet positions such as amounts due from banks, Loans and advances to customers, 
Financial assets at fair value not held for trading, Financial assets measured at amortized cost, Customer deposits, Debt 
issued measured at amortized cost, and derivatives, including those subject to hedge accounting. Fair value changes to 
these positions may affect other comprehensive income (OCI) or the income statement, depending on their accounting 
treatment. 
Our largest banking book interest rate exposures arise from customer deposits and lending products in Global Wealth 
Management and Personal & Corporate Banking, as well as from debt issuance, liquidity buffers and interest rate hedges 
in Group Treasury. The inherent interest rate risks stemming from Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate 
Banking are generally transferred to Group Treasury, to manage them centrally together with our modeled interest rate 
duration assigned to equity, goodwill and real estate. This makes the netting of interest rate risks across different sources 
possible, while leaving the originating businesses with commercial margin and volume management. The residual interest 
rate risk is mainly hedged with interest rate swaps, to the vast majority of which we apply hedge accounting. Short-term 
exposures and HQLA classified as Financial assets at fair value not held for trading are hedged with derivatives accounted 
for on a mark-to-market basis. Long-term fixed-rate debt issued and HQLA hedged with external interest rate swaps are 
designated in fair value hedge accounting relationships.
Risk management and governance
IRRBB is measured using several metrics, the most relevant of which are the following.
– EVE sensitivity to yield curve moves is calculated as changes in the present value of future cash flows irrespective of 
accounting treatment. These yield curve moves are also the key risk factors for statistical and stress-based measures, 
e.g., VaR and stress scenarios, as well as the regulatory interest rate scenarios. These are measured and reported daily. 
The regulatory IRRBB EVE exposure is the most adverse regulatory interest rate scenario that is netted across currencies. 
It excludes the sensitivity from additional tier 1 (AT1) capital instruments (as per specific FINMA requirements) and the 
modeled interest rate duration assigned to equity, goodwill and real estate. UBS also applies granular internal interest 
rate shock scenarios to its banking book positions to monitor its specific risk profile. 
– Net interest income (NII) sensitivities to yield curve moves are calculated as changes of baseline NII over a set time 
horizon, which we internally compute by assuming interest rates in all currencies develop according to their marketimplied forward rates and assuming constant business volumes and product mix and no specific management actions. 
The sensitivities are measured and reported monthly. 
We actively manage IRRBB, with the aim of reducing the volatility of NII subject to limits and triggers for EVE and NII 
exposure at consolidated and significant legal entity levels.
The Group Asset and Liability Committee (the ALCO) and, where relevant, ALCOs at a legal entity level perform 
independent oversight over the management of IRRBB, which is also subject to Group Internal Audit and model 
governance.
› Refer to “Group Internal Audit” in the “Corporate governance” section of this report and to “Risk measurement” in this section for 
more information
Key modeling assumptions
The cash flows from customer deposits and lending products used in calculation of EVE sensitivity exclude commercial 
margins and other spread components, are aggregated by daily time buckets and are discounted using risk-free rates. 
Our external issuances are discounted using UBS’s senior debt curve, and capital instruments are modeled to the first call 
date. NII sensitivity, which includes commercial margins, is calculated over a one-year time horizon, assuming constant 
balance sheet structure and volumes, and considers embedded interest rate options.
The average repricing maturity of non-maturing deposits and loans is determined via target replication portfolios designed 
to protect product margins. Optimal replicating portfolios are determined at granular currency- and product-specific 
levels by simulating and applying a real-world market rate model to historically calibrated client rate and volume models.
We use an econometric prepayment model to forecast prepayment rates on US mortgage loans in UBS Bank USA and 
agency mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) held in various liquidity portfolios of UBS Americas Holding LLC consolidated. 
These prepayment rates are used to forecast both mortgage loan and MBS balances under various macroeconomic 
scenarios. The prepayment model is used for a variety of purposes, including risk management and regulatory stress 
testing. Swiss mortgages and fixed-term deposits generally do not carry similar optionality, due to prepayment and early 
redemption penalties. 

Effect of interest rate changes on shareholders’ equity and CET1 capital
The “Accounting and capital effect of changes in interest rates” table below shows the effects on shareholders’ equity 
and CET1 capital of gains and losses from changes in interest rates in the main banking book positions. We use derivatives 
to hedge interest rate risks in the banking book and these reflect changes in interest rates as an immediate fair value 
gain or loss, recognized either in the income statement or through OCI. Where hedged items are accrual accounted, we 
aim to minimize accounting asymmetries by applying hedge accounting to reflect the economic hedge relationship.
In a rising rate scenario, we would have an initial decrease in shareholders’ equity as a result of fair value losses on our 
derivatives recognized in OCI, while we would expect higher NII over time as rates increase. The effect on CET1 capital 
would be much lower, as gains and losses on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are not recognized for 
regulatory capital purposes.

Economic value of equity sensitivity
Audited | The EVE sensitivity in the banking book to a +1-basis-point parallel shift in yield curves was negative USD 30.1m 
as of 31 December 2023, compared with negative USD 25.0m as of 31 December 2022. This excludes the sensitivity of 
USD 4.9m from AT1 capital instruments (as per specific FINMA requirements) in contrast to general BCBS guidance. The 
exposure in the banking book of the UBS Group increased in 2023, due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group 
and interest rate risk hedges of the recent AT1 capital instrument issuances.
The majority of our interest rate risk in the banking book is a reflection of the net asset duration that we run to offset 
our modeled sensitivity of net USD 24.3m (31 December 2022: USD 19.6m) assigned to our equity, goodwill and real 
estate, with the aim of generating a stable NII contribution. Of this, USD 17.6m and USD 5.6m are attributable to the US 
dollar and the Swiss franc portfolios, respectively (31 December 2022: USD 14.0m and USD 4.8m, respectively).
In addition to the sensitivity mentioned above, we calculate the six interest rate shock scenarios prescribed by FINMA. 
The “Parallel up” scenario, assuming all positions were fair valued, was the most severe and would have resulted in a 
change in EVE of negative USD 5.7bn, or 6.1%, of our tier 1 capital (31 December 2022: negative USD 4.6bn, or 7.9%), 
which is well below the 15% threshold as per the BCBS supervisory outlier test for high levels of interest rate risk in the 
banking book. 
The immediate effect on our tier 1 capital in the “Parallel up” scenario as of 31 December 2023 would have been a 
decrease of USD 0.9bn, or 0.9% (31 December 2022: USD 0.4bn, or 0.6%), reflecting the fact that the vast majority of 
our banking book is accrual accounted or subject to hedge accounting. The “Parallel up” scenario would subsequently 
have a positive effect on NII, assuming a constant balance sheet.
UBS also applies granular internal interest rate shock scenarios to its banking book positions to monitor the banking 
book’s specific risk profile. 
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 133
Net interest income sensitivity
The main NII sensitivity in the banking book resides in Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking. 
We assign a target duration to our investment of equity portfolio, and Group Treasury actively manages the residual 
IRRBB. This sensitivity is assessed using a number of scenarios assuming parallel and non-parallel shifts in yield curves, 
with various degrees of severity, and we have set and monitor thresholds for the NII sensitivity to immediate parallel 
shocks of –200 and +200 basis points under the assumption of constant balance sheet volume and structure. 

Other market risk exposures
Own credit
We are exposed to changes in UBS’s own credit reflected in the valuation of financial liabilities designated at fair value 
when UBS’s own credit risk would be considered by market participants, except for fully collateralized liabilities or other 
obligations for which it is established market practice to not include an own-credit component. 
› Refer to “Note 21 Fair value measurement” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report for more information 
about own credit
Structural foreign exchange risk
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities held in foreign operations are translated into US dollars at the closing foreign 
exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Value changes (in US dollars) of non-US dollar assets or liabilities due to foreign 
exchange movements are recognized in OCI and therefore affect shareholders’ equity and CET1 capital.
Group Treasury uses strategies to manage this foreign currency exposure, including matched funding of assets and 
liabilities and net investment hedging.

Equity investments and investment fund units
Audited | We make direct investments in a variety of entities and buy equity holdings in both listed and unlisted companies, 
with the aim of supporting our business activities and delivering strategic value to UBS. This includes investments in 
exchange and clearing house memberships, as well as minority investments in early-stage fintechs and technology 
companies via UBS Next. We may also make investments in funds that we manage in order to fund or seed them at 
inception or to demonstrate that our interests align with those of investors. We also buy, and are sometimes required by 
agreement or regulation to buy, securities and units from investment vehicles that we have sold to clients.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 134
The fair value of equity investments tends to be influenced by factors specific to the individual investments. Equity 
investments are generally intended to be held for the medium or long term and may be subject to lock-up agreements. 
For these reasons, we generally do not control these exposures by using market risk measures applied to trading activities. 
However, such equity investments are subject to a different range of controls, including preapproval of new investments 
by business management and Risk Control, portfolio and concentration limits, and regular monitoring and reporting to 
senior management. They are also included in our Group-wide statistical and stress-testing metrics, which flow into our 
risk appetite framework.
As of 31 December 2023, we held equity investments and investment fund units totaling USD 7.2bn, of which USD 4.8bn 
was classified as Financial assets at fair value not held for trading and USD 2.4bn as Investments in associates. 

31 December 2023 were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through Equity, and can broadly be 
categorized as money market instruments and debt securities primarily held for statutory, regulatory or liquidity reasons.
The risk control framework applied to debt instruments classified as Financial assets measured at fair value through other 
comprehensive income depends on the nature of the instruments and the purpose for which we hold them. Our 
exposures may be included in market risk limits or be subject to specific monitoring and interest rate sensitivity analysis. 
They are also included in our Group-wide statistical and stress-testing metrics, which flow into our risk appetite 
framework. 
Debt instruments classified as Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income had a fair 
value of USD 2.2bn as of 31 December 2023, compared with USD 2.2bn as of 31 December 2022. 

Pension risk
We provide a number of pension plans for past and current employees, some classified as defined benefit pension plans 
under IFRS Accounting Standards, which can have a material effect on our equity under IFRS Accounting Standards and 
CET1 capital.
Pension risk is the risk that defined benefit plans’ funded status might decrease, negatively affecting our capital. This can 
result from falls in the value of a plan’s assets or in the investment returns, increases in defined benefit obligations, or 
combinations of the above.
Important risk factors affecting the fair value of pension plans’ assets include equity market returns, interest rates, bond 
yields, and real estate prices. Important risk factors affecting the present value of expected future benefit payments 
include high-grade bond yields, interest rates, inflation rates, and life expectancy.
Pension risk is included in our Group-wide statistical and stress-testing metrics, which flow into our risk appetite 
framework. The potential effects are thus captured in the post-stress capital ratio calculations.

financial statements” section of this report for more information about defined benefit plans
UBS own share exposure
Group Treasury holds UBS Group AG shares to hedge future share delivery obligations related to employee share-based 
compensation awards, and also holds shares purchased under the share repurchase program. In addition, the Investment 
Bank holds a limited number of UBS Group AG shares, primarily in its capacity as a market-maker with regard to UBS 
Group AG shares and related derivatives, and to hedge certain issued structured debt instruments.

Country risk 
Country risk framework
Country risk includes all country-specific events occurring in a sovereign jurisdiction that may lead to impairment of UBS’s 
exposures. It may take the form of: (i) sovereign risk, which is the ability and willingness of a government to honor its 
financial commitments; (ii) transfer risk, which arises if a counterparty or issuer cannot acquire foreign currencies 
following a moratorium by a central bank on foreign exchange transfers; or (iii) “other” country risk. “Other” country 
risk may manifest itself through, on the one hand, increased and multiple counterparty and issuer default risk (systemic 
risk) and, on the other hand, events that may affect a country’s standing, such as adverse shocks affecting political 
stability or institutional and / or legal frameworks.
We assign a country rating to each country, which reflects our view of its creditworthiness and of the probability of a 
country risk event occurring. Country ratings are mapped to statistically derived default probabilities, described under 
“Probability of default” in this section. We use this internal analysis to set the credit ratings of governments and central 
banks, estimate the probability of a transfer event occurring, and establish rules on how aspects of country risk should 
be incorporated in counterparty ratings of non-sovereign entities domiciled in the respective country.
Country ratings are also used to define our risk appetite regarding foreign countries. A country risk limit (i.e., maximum 
aggregate exposure) applies to exposures to counterparties or issuers of securities and financial investments in the given 
foreign country. We may limit the extension of credit, transactions in traded products or positions in securities based on 
a country risk ceiling even if our exposure to a counterparty is otherwise acceptable.
Our country risk framework differs across UBS Group, and alignment is part of the ongoing integration of Credit Suisse.
For internal measurement and control of country risk, we also consider the financial effect of market disruptions arising 
prior to, during and after a country crisis. These may take the form of a severe deterioration in a country’s debt, equity 
or other asset markets, or a sharp depreciation of its currency. We use stress testing to assess potential financial effects 
of severe country or sovereign crises. This involves the developing of plausible stress scenarios for combined stress testing 
and the identification of countries that may potentially be subject to a crisis event, determining potential losses and 
making assumptions about recovery rates depending on the types of credit transactions involved and their economic 
importance to the affected countries.
Country risk exposure
Country risk exposure measure
The presentation of country risk follows our internal risk view, where the basis for measuring exposures depends on the 
product category in which we classify the exposures. In addition to the classification of exposures into banking products 
and traded products, covered in “Credit risk profile of the Group” in this section, for UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse 
the trading inventory is also shown. Issuer risk on securities such as bonds and equities, as well as risk relating to 
underlying reference assets for derivative positions, is classified under trading inventory. The trading inventory is managed 
on a net basis, and the value of long positions is netted against that of short positions with the same underlying issuer. 
Net exposures are, however, floored at zero per issuer in the figures presented in the following tables. As a result, 
potentially offsetting benefits of certain hedges and short positions across issuers are not recognized.
We do not recognize any expected recovery values when reporting country exposures as exposure before hedges, except 
for risk-reducing effects of master netting agreements and collateral held in either cash or portfolios of diversified 
marketable securities, which we deduct from the potential exposure values. Within banking products and traded 
products, risk-reducing effects of credit protection are generally taken into account on a notional basis when determining 
the net of hedge exposures.
Country risk exposure allocation
In general, exposures are shown against the country of domicile of the contractual counterparty or the issuer of the 
security. For some counterparties whose economic substance in terms of assets or source of revenues is primarily 
located in a different country, the exposure is allocated to the risk domicile of those assets or revenues.
In the case of derivatives, we show the counterparty’s risk potential exposure against the counterparty’s country of risk 
(presented within traded products). In addition, risk associated with an instantaneous fall in value of underlying 
reference assets to zero (assuming no recovery) is shown against the country of risk of the issuer of the reference asset 
(presented within the trading inventory for UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse only). This approach allows us to capture 
both counterparty and, where applicable, issuer elements of risk arising from derivatives and applies comprehensively 
for all derivatives, including single-name credit default swaps (CDSs) and other credit derivatives.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 136
CDSs are primarily bought and sold in relation to our trading businesses, and, to a much lesser degree, used to hedge 
credit valuation adjustments. Holding CDSs for credit default protection does not necessarily protect the buyer of 
protection against losses, as contracts only pay out under certain scenarios. The effectiveness of our CDS protection as a 
hedge of default risk is influenced by several factors, including the contractual terms under which a given CDS was 
written. Generally, only the occurrence of credit events as defined by the CDS contract’s terms (which may include, 
among other events, failure to pay, restructuring or bankruptcy) results in payments under the purchased credit protection 
contracts. For CDS contracts on sovereign obligations, repudiation can also be deemed as a default event. The 
determination as to whether a credit event has occurred is made by the relevant International Swaps and Derivatives 
Association (ISDA) determination committees (composed of various ISDA member firms) based on the terms of the CDS 
and the facts and circumstances surrounding the event.
Top 20 country risk exposures
The table below shows our 20 largest country exposures by product type, excluding our home country, as of 31 December 
2023 compared with 31 December 2022.
Compared with the prior year, our net exposure generally increased due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. 
The list of our top 20 countries remained broadly unchanged, with five new entries (Ireland, Spain, Brazil, Qatar and the 
Cayman Islands) at the bottom of the list, with the exposure to each of those five not exceeding USD 4.0bn. Based on 
the sovereign rating categories, as of 31 December 2023, 83% of our emerging market country exposure was rated 
investment grade, compared with 87% as of 31 December 2022.
Israel
As of 31 December 2023, our direct country risk exposure to Israel was USD 439m, mainly from lending and collateralized 
over-the-counter derivates exposure within the Investment Bank. Our direct exposure to Gulf Cooperation Council 
countries was USD 6.8bn. We have limited direct exposure to Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, and we have no direct exposure 
to Iran, Iraq or Syria. 
Russia
Our direct country risk exposure to Russia contributed USD 256m to our total emerging market exposure of USD 44.5bn 
as of 31 December 2023. This included loans and trade finance exposures in Non-core and Legacy and Personal & 
Corporate Banking, as well as aviation finance in Global Wealth Management. 
We had no material direct country risk exposures to Belarus or to Ukraine as of 31 December 2023 and no material 
reliance on Russian, Belarusian or Ukrainian collateral.

Sustainability and climate risk
Managing sustainability and climate risk is a key component of our corporate responsibility. We define sustainability and 
climate risk as the risk that UBS negatively impacts, or is impacted by, climate change, natural capital, human rights, and 
other environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. Sustainability and climate risks may manifest as credit, market, 
liquidity, business and non-financial risks for UBS, resulting in potential adverse financial, liability and reputational 
impacts.
Group Risk Control is responsible for our firm-wide sustainability and climate risk framework and the management of 
exposure to sustainability and climate (financial) risks on an ongoing basis as a second line of defense, while our Group 
Compliance, Regulatory & Governance function monitors the adequacy of our control environment for non-financial 
risks, applying independent control and oversight. We manage sustainability and climate risk under a dedicated risk 
management framework.
Our firm-wide sustainability and climate risk management framework and related policy standards and guidelines 
underpin our management practices and control principles, enabling us to identify and manage potential adverse impacts 
on the climate, the environment and human rights, as well as the associated risks affecting us and our clients while 
supporting the transition toward a net-zero future. Overseen by senior management, the framework applies to the 
balance sheet, our own operations and our supply chain. In 2023, we worked to revise this framework and our processes 
across UBS, following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. 
Recognizing that it is imperative to have a consistent approach to managing sustainability and climate risk across the 
combined Group, we have merged the sustainability and climate risk teams under the Sustainability CRO. We also 
developed a combined Group policy for sustainability and climate risks, including risk appetite standards. Furthermore, 
we continued to work toward consolidating our sustainability and climate risk metrics and quantitative approaches across 
the combined entity, while enhancing our analytical capabilities and further integrating sustainability and climate risk 
considerations into traditional financial and non-financial risks, for example, by enriching our risk management processes 
and reporting around nature-related risks. 
The current inventory of quantitative sustainability and climate risk metrics, including exposure to carbon-related assets, 
climate-sensitive sectors and nature-related risks for UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse is disclosed in this section. UBS 
is in the process of implementing a combined and aligned sustainability-and-climate-risk dataset across UBS Group and 
including Credit Suisse AG. For this reason, UBS will publish UBS Group and Credit Suisse AG sustainability and climate 
risk metrics required pursuant to FINMA Circular 2016/1 “Disclosure – banks", Annex 5, in a supplement to the UBS 
Group Annual Report 2023 and the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, in line with the publication timeline for the 
semi-annual Pillar 3 disclosures in the third quarter of 2024.

Risk identification and measurement
On an annual basis, an assessment of the materiality of sustainability- and climate-driven risks is carried out in accordance 
with the ISO 14001 standard for environmental management systems. 
We aim to identify sustainability and climate risks at divisional and cross-divisional levels, both through the assessment 
mentioned above and, increasingly, by integrating them into the firm-wide traditional risk identification and 
measurement process. This approach is also applied to significant Group entities under UBS Group AG.
Our risk identification methodologies collectively define UBS’s materiality-driven approach, focus areas and key risk 
drivers. The outputs of these efforts define our sustainability and climate risk management strategy by: 
– identifying concentrations of climate- and nature-sensitive exposures that may make UBS vulnerable to financial and 
non-financial risks, enabling prioritization of resources toward enhanced risk quantification and subsequent 
management actions; 
– supporting the delivery of a client-centric business strategy, where we assist clients with their sustainability transition 
(e.g., low-carbon transition) finance, identifying clients that could benefit from sustainability-focus UBS products and 
services; and 
– providing information to senior management to support more-informed decision-making on sustainability- and 
climate-driven risks, along with providing decision-useful information to stakeholders through our external disclosures.

Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 139
Transition risk 
Climate-driven transition risks arise from the efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change. They cover the financial 
impact on our clients or on UBS itself through the credit worthiness of our counterparties or the value of collateral 
we hold. The financial impacts from climate transition risk could materialize through three key risk factors:
– climate policies, affecting operating expenses (e.g., carbon taxes), analyzed both directly and indirectly;
– low-carbon technologies and their potential for disruption, affecting capital expenditure requirements and / or market 
share due to low-cost competition; and
– shifts in consumer or investor sentiment, affecting revenues (shifts in consumer demand) or market-perceived value.
To calculate our exposure to climate transition risks, we have analyzed economic sectors within our classification 
taxonomy with a view to define segments that share similar characteristics in their vulnerability to the risk factors 
identified above. The approach consists of grouping companies into these segments under an adverse risk scenario. This 
scenario is defined as an immediate and disorderly approach toward meeting the well-below-2˚C Paris goal over the zeroto-three-year time horizon (reflecting the business planning horizon). The outcome of this process is a sector-level 
transition risk heatmap, where the risk ratings ranging from “Low” to “High”, and “climate-sensitive” include the top 
three ratings (Moderate, Moderately High and High). 
The transition risk heatmap shows that, at the end of 2023, UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse exposure to climatesensitive sectors and related activities was relatively stable. Climate-driven transition-risk-sensitive exposure accounted 
for 12.1% of total customer lending exposure (up from 11.7% in 2022), mainly driven by an increase in exposure to 
commercial real estate in Switzerland. This risk exposure can be associated with the passage of the Climate and Innovation 
Act in Switzerland and the expected zero-to-three-year impact on energy-efficiency rules in the commercial real estate 
sector. A slight reduction in exposure can be observed in the fossil fuels trading and mining conglomerates sectors.

Physical risk 
Climate-driven physical risks arise from acute hazards, which are increasing in severity and frequency, and chronic climate 
risks arise from an incrementally changing climate. These effects may include increased temperature and sea-level rise, 
and the gradual changes may affect productivity and property values and increase the severity and frequency of acute 
hazards.
Our physical risk heatmap methodology groups together corporate counterparties based on exposure to key physical risk 
factors (risk segmentation), by rating sectoral, sub-sectoral and geographical vulnerabilities to climate-driven physical 
risks. These vulnerabilities were identified using a proprietary in-house UBS model. The model, developed in 2023, is a 
significant advancement from the historical physical risk heatmapping methodology that UBS published in 2021 and 
2022. By leveraging over a billion data points, UBS analyzed cross-sector information on asset-level data (sub-company 
level), third-party climate hazard ratings through geospatial datasets, and academic insights into how hazards and 
production methods may be aggravated or complementary (transmission channels). The analyses were then quantitatively 
aggregated across assets, transmission channels (including value chains) and hazards at a sub-sector / country or subcountry level of granularity.
The refined heatmap methodology shows that our physical risk vulnerability remained, on average, moderately low year 
on year. Given UBS’s business profile, the key drivers for UBS’s climate-sensitive lending (physical risk) are financial 
intermediation activities and, collectively, the services, agriculture and transportation sectors. In its current state, the 
model takes a conservative approach in its key assumptions, limiting full incorporation of geographical and sectorial 
sources of variability, which may either further amplify or mitigate financial vulnerability. We are committed to addressing 
these and other limitations by continuously improving the modeling approach in parallel with the industry, as it continues 
to standardize the disclosure of physical climate risk data, integrates regionalized scientific climate models, specializes in 
its impact on sectors and assets, and collaborates with a view to more informed decision-making. More specifically, in 
2024 and beyond, UBS will seek to expand its use of vendor data through both diversification and refinement, further 
address the limitations presented due to key assumptions in the model, and develop approaches to address data 
limitations in other types of assets (e.g., real estate). We will also explore the link between the changing climate and 
nature-related financial risks, which may result in intensified compounding vulnerabilities. Companies and activities that 
depend on natural-capital assets may be adversely affected by a changing climate, whose relationships have proven to 
either reduce or augment ecosystem services like fresh water or biodiversity.
The physical risk heatmap below shows that, at the end of 2023, UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse exposure to climatesensitive sectors was 9.7% (up from 8.4% in 2022). This increase was driven by exposure to the services sector, which 
includes financial services activities in emerging markets. Most of the climate-sensitive physical risk exposure is located in 
countries that have high adaptive capacity to physical risk hazards, which is an important aspect to consider when 
assessing the 9.7% exposure to physical risk.

Nature-related risks
Nature-related risks refer to how humans and organizations depend on and impact the natural environment. Natural 
resources are referred to as natural capital that, in combination, provides the ecosystem services that benefit people and 
the planet. Below we describe our understanding of how UBS’s business model may depend on or impact those services, 
resulting in financial and non-financial risk for UBS.
Biodiversity is presented as a function of various natural-capital assets providing life on earth with a range of services 
(ecosystem services), categorized and rated for its role in the development of medicines, technologies and more. UBS‘s 
development of insights in biodiversity, among other nature-related risks, is discussed in the context of improving data 
and methodology. Similar to the collaborative effort that UBS has made on climate-related risks in earlier years, we have 
contributed to global efforts to raise awareness of and exchange knowledge about nature-related risk assessment 
methodologies. UBS has made these contributions through its role as a member of the Taskforce on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures since 2021 and the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (the UNEP FI) working 
group on nature-related risks (since 2018). As a key member of the UNEP FI working group, UBS has supported the 
development of a methodology to assess nature-related risks from both the dependency and impact perspectives to the 
natural environment. UBS took part in the collaborative work to develop the Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, 
Risks and Exposure toolkit (ENCORE), which has been a central input to UBS’s initial nature-related risk analysis. The UNEP 
FI coordinated this working group in partnership with the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, Global Canopy, the 
Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs and the Swiss Federal Office for the Environment.
In 2022, we initially piloted a quantification approach for nature-related risks solely based on dependency of our clients 
on the natural environment, using the ENCORE methodology. This approach enabled us to assess vulnerability to naturesensitive economic activities by our clients, which may drive financial risks for UBS, such as reduced creditworthiness of 
our clients or the value of companies’ debt or of equity posted as collateral for lending activities. In 2023, we expanded 
the definition of our “nature-sensitive metric” to now include both dependencies and impacts on nature, its assets, and 
the ecosystem services nature provides to sustain human activities. Our methodology assigns ratings on the same scale 
and granularity as our climate-driven sector-level heatmaps. As in the case of the climate-driven heatmap assumptions, 
UBS takes a conservative approach in assigning the overall nature-sensitive risk rating to each of the UBS industry codes. 
The key assumption here is driven by taking the higher of the two values between the ENCORE-defined impact and the 
dependency ratings. 
Our enhanced nature-related risk heatmap below shows that at the end of 2023, UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse 
exposure to nature-sensitive sectors was 15.1% (up from 14.4% in 2022) of our total customer lending exposure. 
Sensitivity is driven by sectors that either have a high impact or a high dependency on the natural environment. These 
include metals and mining, utilities, and agriculture. Our business activities are concentrated in Lombard lending and the 
financial services sector, which are rated as relatively low. A strong correlation can be observed between climate risk 
sensitivity (both transition risk and physical risk) and nature-related risks, with a heightened correlation identified in 
climate-sensitive sectors.

Climate scenario analysis 
We use scenario-based approaches to assess our exposure to physical and transition risks stemming from climate change. 
We have introduced a series of assessments performed through industry collaborations in order to harmonize approaches 
for addressing methodological and data gaps. We have performed top-down balance sheet stress testing (across preacquisition UBS), as well as a targeted bottom-up analysis of specific sector exposures covering short-, medium- and longterm time horizons.
The work performed includes regulatory scenario analysis and stress-test exercises, including the Climate Risk Stress Test 
of the European Central Bank, which is used to assess banks’ preparedness for dealing with financial and economic 
shocks stemming from climate risk; and the Bank of England 2021 Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario: Financial risks 
from climate change, which has enabled UBS to assess management actions in response to different scenario results, as 
well as perform counterparty-level analysis.
While these exercises showed mild losses and low exposure to climate risk for the entities in scope, the analysis enabled 
UBS to enhance climate risk scenario analysis and stress testing, further developing our capabilities for assessing risks and 
vulnerabilities from climate change. 
In 2023, we further advanced our capabilities surrounding internal climate risk scenario analysis and stress testing for 
UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse. We enhanced and refined our climate risk scenarios, with a focus on both transition 
and physical risk projections across 30 years. Furthermore, we have been developing additional corresponding climate 
risk models to amend the coverage of major risk types and have enhanced consistent modeling approaches in the 
context of real estate energy performance and location-specific physical risks. For details on Credit Suisse’s approach 
to climate scenario analysis, refer to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023.

As a part of the sustainability and climate risk monitoring process, we have developed methodologies and metrics to 
assess our ongoing exposure to carbon-related assets and climate-sensitive sectors. In developing our metrics, we consider 
the inputs and guidance provided by standard-setting organizations, as well as new or enhanced regulatory requirements 
for climate disclosures. In 2023, we continued working on methodologies covering climate transition, physical and 
nature-related risk. Examples of such enhancements include issuer and traded risk products in our risk monitoring and 
reporting capabilities. We have newly expanded reporting scopes and enhanced methodologies, which, together with 
the underlying metrics, are illustrated in the table below.

reporting” at ubs.com/investors, for more information
The table below includes climate- and nature-related risk metrics for UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse and UBS AG on 
standalone basis, as well as for UBS Switzerland AG and UBS Europe SE, both on a standalone basis. Respective climateand nature-related risk metrics will be published for UBS Group and Credit Suisse AG in a supplement to the UBS Group 
Annual Report 2023 and the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023, in line with the publication timeline for the semiannual Pillar 3 disclosures in the third quarter of 2024.
Carbon-related assets proportion of total customer lending exposure for UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse decreased 
to 7.2% in 2023 from 7.5% in 2022. In 2023, the share of climate-sensitive sectors for UBS Group excluding Credit 
Suisse was 12.1% for transition risk and 9.7 % for physical risk of our total customer lending exposure.
The main driver for transition risk was an increase in exposure to commercial real estate in Switzerland. This risk exposure 
was associated with the passing of the Climate and Innovation Act in Switzerland and the expected zero-to-three-year 
impact on energy-efficiency rules in the commercial real estate sector. The key driver for physical risk was exposure to 
the services sector, which includes financial services activities in emerging markets. Most of the climate-sensitive physical 
risk exposure was located in countries that have high levels of capacity to adapt to physical risk hazards.
The year-end 2023 exposure to nature-sensitive sectors of the UBS Group was 15.1% of the total customer lending 
exposure. For nature-related risk, sensitivity was driven by sectors that either have a high impact or a high dependency 
on the natural environment. These include metals and mining, utilities, and agriculture. Our business activities are 
concentrated in Lombard lending and the financial services sector, which are rated as having relatively low sensitivity to 
nature risk. A strong correlation can be observed between climate risk sensitivity (both transition and physical) and naturerelated risks, with a heightened correlation in climate-sensitive sectors.

1 Methodologies for assessing climate- and nature-related risks are emerging and may change over time. As the methodologies, tools, and data availability improve, we will further develop our risk identification and 
measurement approaches. Lombard lending rating is assigned based on the average riskiness of loans. 2 Metrics are calculated and restated based on the 2023 methodology, across three years of reporting, 2021–
2023. 3 As defined by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (the TCFD), in its expanded definition published in 2021, UBS defines carbon-related assets through industry-identifying attributes of 
the firm’s banking book. UBS further includes the four non-financial sectors addressed by the TCFD, including, but not limited to, fossil fuel extraction, carbon-based power generation, transportation (air, sea, rail, 
and auto manufacture), metals production and mining, manufacturing industries, real estate development, chemicals, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals, building and construction materials and activities, forestry, 
agriculture, fishing, food and beverage production, as well as including trading companies that may trade any of the above (e.g., oil trading or agricultural commodity trading companies). This metric is agnostic of risk 
rating, and therefore may include exposures of companies that may be already transitioning or adapting their business models to climate risks, unlike UBS climate-sensitive-sectors methodology, which takes a riskbased approach to defining material exposure to climate impacts. 4 Total customer lending exposure consists of total loans and advances to customers and guarantees, as well as irrevocable loan commitments 
(within the scope of expected credit loss) and is based on consolidated and standalone IFRS numbers. The credit exposure includes portfolio adjustment bookings, which are either directly impacting the metrics, and 
have been reflected in the heatmaps, or are impact assessed and immaterial to the metrics representation. 5 UBS continues to collaborate to resolve methodological and data challenges, and seeks to integrate both 
impacts to and dependency on a changing natural and climatic environment in how it evaluates risks and opportunities. 6 Climate- and nature-related risks are scored between 0 and 1, based on sustainability and 
climate risk transmission channels, as outlined in the Supplement to the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023. Risk ratings represent a range of scores across five-rating categories: low, moderately low, moderate, 
moderately high, and high. The climate- or nature-sensitive exposure metrics are determined based upon the top three of the five rated categories: moderate to high. 7 Traded products are newly disclosed for 2023. 
Risk exposures consist of receivables from securities financing transactions, cash collateral receivables on derivative instruments and financial assets measured at amortized cost. 8 Issuer risk, is newly disclosed for 
2023. Risk exposures consist of high-quality liquid assets assets, debt securities, bonds and liquidity buffer securities. 9 Nature-related risk metric methodology has been further strategically enhanced, as part of an 
ongoing collaboration between UBS and UNEP FI. 
The table below presents a view of UBS’s risk profile and year-on-year changes, when compared with 2022, within sectors 
and across climate- and nature-related risks. It shows UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse’s total exposure to and trends 
in each sector, followed by an exposure-weighted risk rating, the trend in the underlying quantitative score year on year, 
and, finally, the total absolute exposure, rated as moderate, moderately high or high, within that sector. This is presented 
for all three risk types. Exposures may appear under one or more of the risk types and, therefore, cannot be added 
together; this is because the methodologies are distinct in their approach and application.
Overall, UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse had a moderate or moderately low outlook across the three risk categories 
as of the end of 2023. We found that most year-on-year fluctuations were driven by an increase in lending and changes 
in the risk profile relating to commercial real estate activities, especially in Switzerland. The changes in the risk profile can 
be attributed to regulatory action in Switzerland regarding climate policies.

moderately low, moderate, moderately high, and high. The climate- or nature-sensitive exposure metrics are determined based upon the top three of the five rated categories: moderate to high. 6 As a material 
change in risk profile (discrete risk score, weighted average per sub-sector) is considered a >5% shift up, or down, year on year. Similarly, for absolute exposure. 7 Displayed ratings represent exposure-weighted 
averages for a given sector scope. 8 Nature-related risk metric methodology has been further strategically enhanced, as part of an ongoing collaboration between UBS and UNEP FI. 9 Not classified represents the 
portion of UBS’s business activities where methodologies and data are not yet able to provide a rating, e.g., private individuals.

Non-financial risk
Non-financial risk is the risk of undue monetary loss and / or non-monetary adverse consequences resulting from 
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and / or systems, failure to comply with laws and regulations and internal 
policies and procedures, or external events (deliberate, accidental or natural) that have an impact on UBS, its clients or 
its markets.
Key developments
We have identified nine non-financial risk themes as being currently key to us. These are:
– governance and legal structure integration;
– financial and regulatory reporting;
– operational resilience, stability and cybersecurity;
– data life cycle;
– investor protection and market interaction;
– strategic growth initiatives and cross-divisional interaction;
– the evolving nature of anti-money laundering (AML), know your client (KYC), sanctions, anti-bribery and corruption 
(ABC), and fraud;
– employee conduct, capacity and culture; and
– environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks.
UBS continues to actively manage the non-financial risks emerging from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, 
including the current operation of dual corporate structures, and the scale, pace and complexity of the required 
integration activities. These activities continue to be managed by the program run by our Group Integration Office. The 
integration of Credit Suisse requires data to be migrated into the UBS environment and we aim to ensure that we have 
robust controls to preserve data integrity, quality and availability to mitigate data migration risks and to meet regulatory 
expectations.
Through this period of change, we place an increased focus on maintaining and enhancing our control environment and 
continue to cooperate with regulators in relation to the submission and execution of implementation plans to meet 
regulatory expectations, including remediation requirements applicable to Credit Suisse AG. In addition, the Group is 
closely monitoring non-financial risk indicators to detect any potential for adverse impacts on the control environment.
There is an increased risk of cyber-related operational disruption to business activities at our locations and / or those of 
third-party suppliers due to operating an enlarged group of entities. This is combined with the increasingly dynamic threat 
environment, which is intensified by current geopolitical factors and evidenced by the increased volumes and 
sophistication of cyberattacks against financial institutions globally.
Cyberattacks on third-party vendors have affected our operations in the past and continue to be a source of residual risk 
to our business. We remain on heightened alert to respond to and mitigate elevated cyber- and information-security 
threats. During the first quarter of 2023, a third-party vendor, ION XTP, suffered a ransomware attack, which resulted in 
some disruption to our exchange-traded derivatives clearing activities, although we restored our services within 36 hours, 
using an available alternative solution. Following a post-incident review, we are improving our frameworks for managing 
third parties that support our important business services and are taking actions to enhance our cyber-risk assessments 
and controls over third-party vendors. We continue to invest in improving our technology infrastructure and 
information-security governance to improve our defense, detection and response capabilities against cyberattacks.
In addition, we are working to enhance our operational resilience to address these heightened risks and to meet 
regulatory deadlines through 2026. We are implementing a global framework designed to drive enhancements in 
operational resilience across all business divisions and relevant jurisdictions, as well as working with the third parties, 
including vendors, that are of critical importance to our operations to assess their operational resilience against our 
standards.
The increasing interest in data-driven advisory processes, and use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, is 
opening up new questions related to the fairness of AI algorithms, data life-cycle management, data ethics, data privacy 
and security, and records management. In addition, new risks continue to emerge, such as those that result from the 
demand from our clients for distributed ledger technology, blockchain-based assets and cryptocurrencies; however, we 
currently have limited exposure to such risks, and relevant control frameworks for them are implemented and reviewed 
on a regular basis as they evolve.
Competition to find new business opportunities, products and services across the financial services sector, both for firms 
and for customers, is increasing, particularly during periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. Thus, suitability 
risk, product selection, cross-divisional service offerings, quality of advice and price transparency remain areas of 
heightened focus for UBS and for the industry as a whole.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 154
Evolving ESG regulations and major legislation, such as the Consumer Duty regulation in the United Kingdom, the Swiss 
Financial Services Act (FIDLEG) in Switzerland, Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) in the US and the Markets in Financial 
Instruments Directive II (MiFID II) in the EU, all significantly affect the industry and have required adjustments to control 
processes.
Cross-border risk (including unintended permanent establishment) remains an area of regulatory attention for global 
financial institutions, including a focus on market access, such as third-country market access into the European Economic 
Area, and taxation of US persons. We maintain a series of controls designed to address these risks, and we are increasing 
the number of controls that are automated.
Financial crime, including money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions violations, fraud, bribery and corruption, 
continues to present a major risk, as technological innovation and geopolitical developments increase the complexity of 
doing business and heightened regulatory attention continues. An effective financial crime prevention program therefore 
remains essential, and we continue to focus on strategic enhancements to our global AML, KYC and sanctions programs. 
Money laundering and financial fraud techniques are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and geopolitical volatility 
makes the sanctions landscape more complex. The extensive and continuously evolving sanctions arising from the Russia–
Ukraine war require constant attention to prevent circumvention risks, while the conflicts in the Middle East may increase 
terrorist-financing risks.
Achieving fair outcomes for our clients, upholding market integrity and cultivating the highest standards of employee 
conduct are of critical importance to us. We maintain a conduct risk framework across our activities, which is designed 
to align our standards and conduct with these objectives and to retain momentum on fostering a strong culture. On 
5 January 2024, we integrated the UBS and Credit Suisse conduct risk frameworks to align our handling of conduct risk 
across the firm.
In September 2022, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission (the CFTC) issued settlement orders relating to communications recordkeeping requirements in our US 
broker-dealers and our registered swap dealers. In response to shortcomings identified in that context, we continued 
work on a global remediation program started in 2022.
Non-financial risk framework
We follow a Group-wide non-financial risk framework that establishes requirements for identifying, managing, assessing 
and mitigating operational, compliance and financial crime risks to achieve an agreed balance between risk and return. 
It is built on the following pillars:
– classifying inherent risks through 19 non-financial risk taxonomies, which define the universe of material non-financial 
risks that can arise as a consequence of our business activities and external factors;
– performing control assurance activities, including self-assessing the design and operating effectiveness of controls, 
first- and second-line-of-defense control reviews and independent control testing;
– defining the non-financial risk appetite (including a financial risk appetite statement at the Group, UBS AG and 
business division levels for non-financial risk events) through quantitative metrics and thresholds and qualitative 
measures, and assessing risk exposure against appetite;
– assessing inherent and residual risk through risk assessment processes and determining whether additional 
remediation plans are required to address identified deficiencies; and
– proactively and sustainably remediating identified control deficiencies.
Divisional Presidents are accountable for the effectiveness of non-financial risk management and for the robustness of 
the front-to-back control environment within their business divisions, and legal-entity-responsible executives are in charge 
of non-financial risk management within their legal entities. Group function heads are accountable for supporting the 
divisional Presidents and legal-entity-responsible executives of our legal entities in the discharge of this responsibility, by 
confirming completeness and effectiveness of the control environment and non-financial risk management within their 
Group functions. Collectively, divisional Presidents, central Group function heads and legal-entity-responsible executives 
are in charge of implementing the non-financial risk framework.
Compliance & Operational Risk Control (C&ORC) is responsible for providing an independent and objective view of the 
adequacy of non-financial risk management across the Group, and ensuring that compliance risk, financial crime risk and 
operational risk are understood, owned and managed in accordance with our risk appetite. C&ORC business- or functionaligned teams sit within the Group Compliance, Regulatory & Governance function, reporting to the Group Chief 
Compliance and Governance Officer, who is a member of the Group Executive Board.
The non-financial risk framework forms the common basis for managing and assessing compliance risk, financial crime 
risk and operational risk, and there are additional C&ORC activities intended to ensure we are able to demonstrate 
compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 155
Group Compliance, Regulatory & Governance started working under integrated governance in June 2023, and progress 
has been made with the rolling out of the non-financial risk framework methodology and standards, which will be further 
aligned during 2024. To date, a unified non-financial risk framework policy and selected related guidance documents for 
the combined organization have been rolled out, with data, reporting and risk assessments being manually combined, 
or presented separately, until systems and processes are fully aligned.
In 2023, we successfully executed on the framework enhancements designed in 2022, with, for example, several cycles 
of risk appetite assessments performed on the basis of the Group-wide non-financial risk appetite statements across all 
taxonomies. We focused on improving effectiveness by simplifying and digitalizing the non-financial risk framework and 
respective processes.
All functions within UBS are required to periodically assess the design and operating effectiveness of key internal nonfinancial risk controls. The output of these reviews supports the assessment and testing scope of internal controls over 
financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, Section 404 (SOX 404).
Key control deficiencies identified during the internal control and risk assessment processes must be reported in the nonfinancial risk inventory, and sustainable remediation must be defined and executed. These control deficiencies are 
assigned to owners at senior management level and the remediation progress is reflected in the respective managers’ 
annual performance measurement and objectives. To assist with prioritizing the most material control deficiencies and 
measuring aggregated risk exposure, irrespective of origin, a common rating methodology is applied across all three lines 
of defense, as well as by external audit.
Cybersecurity
Risk management and strategy 
Cyber- and information security risk is the risk that a malicious internal or external act, or a failure of IT hardware or 
software, or human error may have a material impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability of UBS’s data or 
information systems.
Cybersecurity is a key operational risk facing UBS and we devote considerable resources to establishing and maintaining 
processes for assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risk through our global workforce and cyber-operations 
centers around the world. 
› Refer to “Risk governance” in this section for information about our approach to risk management, including our risk governance 
framework
Governance
In line with our overall non-financial risk management framework, we take a cross-functional approach to addressing 
cybersecurity risk, with the Group Operations and Technology Office (GOTO), business divisions, Group Compliance, 
Regulatory & Governance (GCRG), Group Risk Control, Group Legal, and Group Internal Audit all playing key roles. Our 
risk control framework follows the three-lines-of-defense model. GOTO establishes the policies and procedures designed 
to safeguard our information systems and the information those systems collect and process. The business divisions, 
together with GOTO, are then responsible for implementing those policies and procedures as part of the first line of 
defense. Group Compliance, Regulatory & Governance (GCRG) leads the second line of defense, by convening and 
consulting with additional control functions to provide independent oversight, and challenges the first line’s cybersecurity 
framework and implementation. As the third line of defense, Group Internal Audit conducts independent reviews and 
validates the first-line and second-line processes and functions.
The Cyber- and Information Security Committee (the CIS-C) is the primary decision-making body with oversight of and 
accountability for the Group-wide cyber- and information security (CIS) program. The committee is jointly chaired by the 
Group Chief Operations and Technology Officer and the Group Chief Compliance and Governance Officer. The Head 
Group Internal Audit is a standing guest. The committee meets on a monthly basis and serves as a platform for interaction 
across all business divisions, Group functions and the three lines of defense for the identification and effective governance 
of CIS strategy, risks and regulatory obligations. The CIS-C governance structure is intended to streamline decisionmaking and, where necessary, escalation to the Board of Directors (the BoD) and Group Executive Board (GEB), who 
maintain overall responsibility for overseeing UBS. 
Because Credit Suisse and UBS still have separate digital platforms, Credit Suisse maintained much of its pre-acquisition 
cyber- and information security governance during 2023, but was increasingly aligned to the UBS CIS risk governance 
framework. Credit Suisse’s CIS program is led by the Credit Suisse Chief Information Security Officer, who reports to the 
Credit Suisse Chief Technology Officer and the UBS Group Chief Information Security Officer (the Group CISO). In 
addition, the Credit Suisse Chief Technology Officer and Credit Suisse Chief Operations Officer report to the Group Chief 
Operations and Technology Officer.

Our cyber- and information security program
Our CIS program is led by the Group CISO, who reports both to the Group Chief Operations and Technology Officer and 
the Group Chief Compliance and Governance Officer. The CIS program is designed to identify, prevent, detect and 
respond to CIS events, with the goal of maintaining the integrity and availability of our technology infrastructure and the 
confidentiality and integrity of our information. Our Group CISO, senior management within GOTO, as well as 
management personnel overseeing the CIS program, all have substantial relevant expertise in the areas of cyber- and 
information security. Our CIS program includes the following elements:
– Threat intelligence: We systematically gather threat information and monitor threat alerts from external sources. Our 
cyber-threat intelligence team analyzes such information and uses it to enhance existing defense capabilities, to 
respond to identified threats and to adjust our cybersecurity strategy where needed. 
– Preventative and detection controls: We use layered firm-wide controls to prevent and detect cyberattacks. Defenses 
include system hardening, firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, and other controls. External network 
connections are identified and recorded in an inventory. Access rights are defined for information assets, and IT systems 
and applications enforce authentication. We maintain access controls and approval processes designed to prevent 
unauthorized access.
– Cyber-defense and incident response capabilities: The Cybersecurity Operations Center is responsible for providing 
24/7/365 real-time monitoring, detection and response capabilities for cybersecurity threats and attacks. Incidents 
assessed as having the potential to adversely affect our critical operations are subject to mandatory management 
notification. If assessed as potentially significant, cybersecurity and data incidents are managed under our crisis 
management framework.
– Education and training: All UBS staff, including the external workforce, receive appropriate CIS awareness training, 
commensurate with their roles and responsibilities. 
– Third-party risk: Vulnerabilities in the cyber-risk environment of third parties represent a particular threat to our CIS 
and our ability to maintain our business services. We follow a risk-based approach to assess and mitigate cybersecurity 
risks related to third parties. Third-party services and processes are monitored and checked on an ongoing basis, with 
appropriate supervision from the CIS-C. This is a key component of our third-party risk management program, 
notwithstanding the challenges we face in imposing the same levels of protection to the systems and data of third 
parties that we rely on ourselves. 
– Monitoring and testing: Effective incident response and problem management processes are complemented by 
vulnerability assessments, penetration and testing engagements based on specific threat scenarios that simulate tactics, 
techniques and procedures that might be used against our systems, as mandated by our policy regulations. This 
includes testing by internal and external red teams. Actual security-related events are directly correlated with threat 
scenarios to monitor and detect potential threats, such as network-intrusion and malware-driven events. Our deployed 
security measures are designed with the objective to isolate and contain threats that are detected to allow for effective 
incident response and analysis.
Our cybersecurity assessment framework
Our cybersecurity assessment framework includes internal and external cybersecurity risk assessments for applications 
and bank processes alongside a structured risk assessment process of third-party service providers. These processes are 
designed, along with our security capabilities, to support business objectives and priorities. 
We conduct assessments to evaluate and test our cybersecurity program, and provide guidance on operating and 
improving the CIS program, including the design and operational effectiveness of the security and resiliency of our 
information systems. Our assessments, along with our threat intelligence capabilities, are used to assess and prioritize 
programs to improve our security, our incident response capabilities and our operational resilience. As the cyber-threat 
landscape evolves at an increasing pace, we seek to enhance our cybersecurity controls to meet developing threats. We 
have ongoing programs that are intended to increase our cybersecurity maturity across various dimensions, including 
governance, identification, protection and detection, as well as cyberattack response and recovery, and risk from thirdparty service providers. 
We recognize that we will never be able to completely eliminate the risk of a future cyberattack, but, by using a riskbased approach, we work toward reducing the likelihood of a successful attack and toward mitigation of the potential 
business impact of such an attack. 
The BoD, its Risk Committee and the GEB receive regular presentations and reports throughout the year from our Group 
Chief Operations and Technology Officer and our Group CISO on internal and external cybersecurity developments, 
threats and risks. In addition, on a quarterly basis, the BoD receives reports on the performance of cybersecurity risk 
appetite metrics, including metrics on vulnerabilities and third-party cybersecurity risks and incidents, and is notified 
promptly if a Board-level cybersecurity risk limit is breached. The Risk Committee of the BoD and the GEB also receive 
regular updates on CIS strategy, risks and alignment with regulatory requirements.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Risk management and control 157
Operational resilience and incident response 
Our business continuity and resilience framework is designed to limit the disruption cybersecurity events cause to our 
business activities. In accordance with the firm’s cyber-incident response framework, the CIS-C, including the incident 
response team, tracks, documents, responds to and analyzes cybersecurity threats and incidents, including those 
experienced by the firm’s third-party service providers that may impact the firm. Additionally, we maintain established 
procedures for responding to, and escalating, cybersecurity and other system availability incidents. These are regularly 
practiced, including tabletop exercises up to and including the GEB and BoD levels. 
Our cybersecurity and data confidentiality contingency plans include event playbooks and escalation procedures designed 
to support a structured assessment of potential incidents and timely escalation and reporting of incidents based on the 
assessed potential impact. Incidents assessed to have the potential to adversely affect our critical operations are subject 
to mandatory management notification. If assessed as potentially significant, cybersecurity and data incidents are 
managed under our crisis management framework, which provides pre-established cross-functional task forces to 
manage the incident, ensure appropriate and timely regulatory, market and client communications and robust oversight 
by management, with escalation frameworks to inform and ensure oversight by the GEB and the BoD.

our crisis management framework
Advanced measurement approach model
The non-financial risk framework outlined above underpins the calculation of regulatory capital for operational risk, which 
enables us to quantify operational risk and define effective risk-mitigating management incentives as part of the related 
operational risk capital allocation approach to the business divisions.
We measure Group operational risk exposure and calculate operational risk regulatory capital using the advanced 
measurement approach (AMA) in accordance with Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and 
international requirements. In 2023, we introduced an aggregation of the AMAs for UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG to 
report on total operational-risk-related risk-weighted assets (RWA) for the UBS Group. The related diversification effect, 
agreed with FINMA, resulted in a USD 10bn reduction for reported RWA from the second quarter of 2023 onward.
An entity-specific AMA model has been applied for UBS Switzerland AG, while for other regulated entities the basic 
indicators or standardized approaches are adopted for regulatory capital in agreement with local regulators. Also, the 
methodology of the UBS AMA is leveraged for entity-specific internal capital adequacy assessment processes.
AMA model calibration and review
A key assumption when calibrating data-driven frequency and severity distributions is that historical losses form a 
reasonable proxy for future events. In line with regulatory expectations, the AMA methodology utilizes both historical 
internal losses and external losses suffered by the broader industry for model calibration purposes.
Initial model outputs driven by the loss history are reviewed and adjusted to reflect fast-changing external developments, 
such as new regulations, geopolitical change, volatile market and economic conditions, and internal factors (e.g., changes 
in business strategy and control framework enhancements). The resulting baseline data-driven frequency and severity 
distributions are reviewed by subject matter experts and where necessary adjusted based on a review of qualitative 
information about the business environment and internal control factors, as well as expert judgment, with the aim of 
forecasting losses.
Our model is reviewed regularly to maintain risk sensitivity and recalibrated at least annually. Any changes to regulatory 
capital as a result of a recalibration or methodology changes are presented to FINMA for approval prior to use for 
disclosure purposes.
The Group- and entity-specific AMA models are subject to an independent validation performed by Model Risk 
Management & Control in line with the Group’s model risk management framework.
The AMA is expected to be replaced by the standardized approach for regulatory capital determination purposes in line 
with the relevant Basel Committee for Banking Supervision Basel III capital regulations. UBS is interacting closely with the 
relevant Swiss authorities to discuss the implementation details and related implementation timeline.

Capital management objectives, planning and activities 
Capital management objectives
Audited | An adequate level of common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) meeting both 
internal assessment and regulatory requirements is a prerequisite for conducting our business activities. 
We are therefore committed to maintaining a strong CET1 capital and TLAC position at all times, in order to meet 
regulatory capital requirements and our target capital ratios, and to support the growth of our businesses.
As of 31 December 2023, our CET1 capital ratio was 14.4% and our CET1 leverage ratio 4.6%, each above our capital 
guidance and also above the requirements for Swiss systemically relevant banks (SRBs) and the Basel Committee on 
Banking Supervision (the BCBS) requirements. We believe that our capital strength, consistent with our capital guidance, 
is a source of confidence for our stakeholders, contributes to our sound credit ratings and is one of the foundations of 
our success. 
The BCBS announced the finalization of the Basel III framework in December 2017, and published the final rules on the 
minimum capital requirements for market risk from the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (the FRTB) in January 
2019. In November 2023, the Swiss Federal Council adopted amendments to the Capital Adequacy Ordinance (the CAO) 
for banks to incorporate the final Basel III standards adopted by the BCBS into Swiss law. The amended CAO will enter 
into force on 1 January 2025. The final degree of alignment between the Swiss implementation and those in other 
jurisdictions remains uncertain at this stage. Although EU legislators target implementation by January 2025, the 
implementation timelines in the UK and the US have been delayed until July 2025. The Swiss Federal Department of 
Finance will inform the Swiss Federal Council about the status of international implementation by the end of July 2024. 
We currently estimate that the revised Basel III framework, including the FRTB, will lead to a further increase in riskweighted assets (RWA) of approximately USD 25bn, of which USD 10bn is in Non-core and Legacy. This estimate is based 
on static balances and on our current understanding of the relevant standards before taking into account mitigating 
actions and not reflecting the impact of the output floor, which is phased in over time. It may change as a result of new 
or updated regulatory interpretations, appropriate conservatism in model calibration, the implementation of Basel III 
standards into national law, changes in business growth, market conditions and other factors. The core business-led 
reductions in RWA, coupled with the run-down of positions in the Non-core and Legacy business division during 2024 
and 2025, are expected to more than offset the effects of revised Basel III standards.

capital and resource guidelines

Capital planning and activities
Audited | We manage our balance sheet, RWA, leverage ratio denominator (LRD) and TLAC ratio levels based on our 
regulatory requirements, within our internal limits and targets, and our externally provided guidance. Our strategic focus 
is on achieving an optimal attribution and use of financial resources between our business divisions and Group Items, as 
well as between our legal entities, while remaining within the limits defined for the Group and allocated to the business 
divisions by the Board of Directors (the BoD). These resource allocations, in turn, affect business plans and earnings 
projections, which are reflected in our capital plans.
The annual strategic planning process includes a capital planning component that is key in defining our capital targets. 
It is based on an attribution of Group RWA and LRD internal limits to the business divisions. 
Limits and targets are established at the Group and business division levels, and are approved by the BoD at least annually. 
In the target-setting process we take into account the current and potential future TLAC requirements, our aggregate 
risk exposure in terms of capital-at-risk and the effect of expected accounting policy changes. 
Monitoring is based on these internal limits and targets and provides indications if any changes are required. Any breach 
of limits in place triggers a series of required remediating actions.
Group Treasury plans for and monitors consolidated TLAC information on an ongoing basis, reflecting business and legal 
entity requirements, as well as regulatory developments in capital regulations. In addition, capital planning and 
monitoring are performed at the legal entity level for our significant subsidiaries and sub-groups that are subject to 
prudential supervision and must meet capital and other supervisory requirements.

Swiss SRB total loss-absorbing capacity framework
The disclosures in this section are provided for UBS Group AG on a consolidated basis and focus on key developments 
during the reporting period and information in accordance with the Basel III framework, as applicable to Swiss SRBs.
Additional regulatory disclosures for UBS Group AG on a consolidated basis are provided in our 31 December 2023 
Pillar 3 Report. The Pillar 3 Report also includes information relating to our significant regulated subsidiaries and subgroups (UBS AG consolidated, UBS AG standalone, UBS Switzerland AG standalone, UBS Europe SE consolidated, 
UBS Americas Holding LLC consolidated, Credit Suisse AG consolidated, Credit Suisse AG standalone, Credit Suisse 
(Schweiz) AG consolidated, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG standalone, Credit Suisse International standalone and Credit 
Suisse Holdings (USA), Inc. consolidated) as of 31 December 2023 and is available under “Pillar 3 disclosures” at 
ubs.com/investors.
Capital and other regulatory information for UBS AG consolidated in accordance with the Basel III framework, as 
applicable to Swiss SRBs, is provided in the UBS AG consolidated Annual Report 2023, available under “Annual 
reporting” at ubs.com/investors.
Regulatory framework
The Basel III framework came into effect in Switzerland on 1 January 2013 and is embedded in the Swiss Capital 
Adequacy Ordinance (the CAO). The CAO also includes the too-big-to-fail (TBTF) provisions applicable to Swiss SRBs. 
Under the Swiss SRB framework, going and gone concern requirements represent the Group’s TLAC requirement. TLAC 
encompasses regulatory capital, such as CET1, loss-absorbing additional tier 1 (AT1) and tier 2 capital instruments, and 
liabilities that can be written down or converted into equity in case of resolution or for the purpose of restructuring 
measures. RWA calculations are based on the applicable rules and models approved by the Swiss Financial Market 
Supervisory Authority (FINMA) for the respective legal entities.
Capital and other instruments contributing to our total loss-absorbing capacity
In addition to CET1 capital, the following instruments contribute to our loss-absorbing capacity:
– loss-absorbing AT1 capital instruments (high- and low-trigger);
– non-Basel III-compliant tier 2 capital instruments; and
– TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt instruments.
Under the Swiss SRB rules, going concern capital includes CET1 and high-trigger loss-absorbing AT1 capital instruments. 
Our existing outstanding low-trigger loss-absorbing AT1 capital instruments are available to meet the going concern 
capital requirements until their first call date. As of their first call date, these instruments are eligible to meet the gone 
concern requirements.
Outstanding high- and low-trigger loss-absorbing tier 2 capital instruments, non-Basel III-compliant tier 2 capital 
instruments and TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt instruments are eligible to meet gone concern requirements until 
one year before maturity. A maximum of 25% of the gone concern requirements can be met with instruments that have 
a remaining maturity of between one and two years (i.e., are in the last year of eligibility). However, once at least 75% 
of the gone concern requirement has been met with instruments that have a remaining maturity of greater than two 
years, all instruments that have a remaining maturity of between one and two years remain eligible to be included in the 
total gone concern capital.

unsecured debt instruments and key features and terms and conditions of capital instruments
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Capital management 161
Total loss-absorbing capacity and leverage ratio requirements
Going concern capital requirements
Under the Swiss SRB requirements, total going concern minimum requirements for all Swiss SRBs are a capital ratio 
requirement of 12.86% of RWA and a leverage ratio requirement of 4.5%. In addition to these minimum requirements, 
an add-on reflecting the degree of systemic importance is applied, based on market share and LRD. The applicable market 
share and LRD add-on requirements for UBS were both unchanged at 0.72% of RWA and 0.25% of LRD, resulting in 
add-ons of 1.44% of RWA and 0.50% of LRD. As a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, the UBS Group 
will be subject to higher TBTF capital requirements for market share and LRD after an appropriate transition period to be 
agreed with FINMA. The phase-in of these increased capital requirements will commence from the end of 2025 and will 
be completed by the beginning of 2030, at the latest.
The Swiss countercyclical capital buffer, at a maximum level of 2.5% on risk-weighted positions that are directly or 
indirectly backed by residential properties in Switzerland, increased our minimum CET1 capital requirement by 33 basis 
points as of 31 December 2023. We also continued to apply countercyclical buffer requirements introduced in other 
BCBS member jurisdictions, which resulted in an additional buffer requirement of 14 basis points as of 31 December 
2023. Overall, countercyclical capital buffers contributed 47 basis points to our minimum CET1 capital requirement as of 
31 December 2023. 
The UBS going concern requirements include the FINMA Pillar 2 capital add-on of USD 800m related to supply chain 
finance funds matter at Credit Suisse. This Pillar 2 capital add-on results in an additional CET1 capital ratio requirement 
of 15 basis points and an additional CET1 leverage ratio requirement of 5 basis points as of 31 December 2023.
The total going concern capital requirements applicable are 14.92% of RWA (including countercyclical buffer 
requirements) and 5.05% of LRD. Furthermore, of the total going concern capital requirement of 14.92% of RWA, at 
least 10.62% must be met with CET1 capital, while a maximum of 4.3% can be met with high-trigger loss-absorbing 
AT1 capital instruments (and our existing outstanding low-trigger AT1 capital instruments, which qualify until their first 
call date as mentioned above). 
Similarly, of the total going concern leverage ratio requirement of 5.05%, at least 3.55% must be met with CET1 capital, 
while a maximum of 1.5% can be met with high-trigger loss-absorbing AT1 capital instruments (and our existing 
outstanding low-trigger AT1 capital instruments, which qualify until their first call date as mentioned above).
Gone concern loss-absorbing capacity requirements
As an internationally active Swiss SRB, UBS is also subject to gone concern loss-absorbing capacity requirements. The 
gone concern requirements also include add-ons for market share and LRD. 
In November 2022, the Swiss Federal Council adopted amendments to the Banking Act and the Banking Ordinance, 
which entered into force as of 1 January 2023. The amendments replaced the resolvability discount on the gone concern 
capital requirements for systemically important banks (SIBs), including UBS, with reduced base gone concern capital 
requirements equivalent to 75% of the total going concern requirements (excluding countercyclical buffer requirements 
and the Pillar 2 add-on). In addition, as of July 2024, FINMA will have the authority to impose a surcharge of up to 25% 
of the total going concern capital requirements (excluding countercyclical buffer requirements and the Pillar 2 add-on) 
based on obstacles to an SIB’s resolvability identified in future resolvability assessments. Our total gone concern 
requirements remained substantially unchanged in 2023.
Our gone concern requirements can be reduced when higher-quality capital instruments (CET1 capital, low-trigger 
loss-absorbing AT1 or certain low-trigger tier 2 capital instruments) are used to meet gone concern requirements. As of 
31 December 2023, UBS did not use any higher-quality capital instruments to fulfill gone concern requirements.
From 1 January 2022 onward, the gone concern requirement after potential reduction for the use of higher-quality capital 
instruments has been floored at 10.0% and 3.75% for the RWA- and LRD-based requirements, respectively.
In this report, we refer to the RWA-based gone concern requirements as gone concern loss-absorbing capacity 
requirements and the RWA-based gone concern ratio is referred to as the gone concern loss-absorbing capacity ratio.
The table below provides the RWA- and LRD-based requirements and information as of 31 December 2023.

5 From 1 January 2023, the resolvability discount on the gone concern capital requirements for systemically important banks (SIBs) has been replaced with reduced base gone concern capital requirements equivalent 
to 75% of the total going concern requirements (excluding countercyclical buffer requirements and the Pillar 2 add-on). 6 As of July 2024, FINMA will have the authority to impose a surcharge of up to 25% of the 
total going concern capital requirements should obstacles to an SIB’s resolvability be identified in future resolvability assessments. 7 Includes applicable add-ons of 1.08% for RWA and 0.38% for LRD. 
Transitional purchase price allocation adjustments for regulatory capital
As part of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent 
liabilities, were recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations. The 
purchase price allocation (PPA) fair value adjustments required under IFRS 3 are recognized as part of negative goodwill 
and include effects on financial instruments measured at amortized cost, such as fair value impacts from interest rates 
and own credit, that are expected to accrete back to par through the income statement as the instruments are held to 
maturity. Similar own-credit-related effects have also been recognized as part of the PPA adjustments on financial 
liabilities measured at fair value. As agreed with FINMA, a transitional CET1 capital treatment has been applied for certain 
of these fair value adjustments, given the substantially temporary nature of the IFRS-3-accounting-driven effects. As such, 
equity reductions under IFRS Accounting Standards of USD 5.9bn (pre-tax) and USD 5.0bn (net of tax) as of the 
acquisition date have been neutralized for CET1 capital calculation purposes, of which USD 1.0bn (net of tax) relates to 
own-credit-related fair value adjustments. The transitional treatment is subject to linear amortization and will reduce to 
nil by 30 June 2027. In 2023, the amortization of transitional CET1 PPA adjustments (interest rate and own credit) was 
USD 0.7bn (net of tax).

Total loss-absorbing capacity and movement 
Our total loss-absorbing capacity increased by USD 94.2bn to USD 199.5bn as of 31 December 2023. 
Going concern capital and movement
Audited | Our CET1 capital mainly consists of: share capital; share premium, which primarily consists of additional paid-in capital 
related to shares issued; and retained earnings. A detailed reconciliation of equity under IFRS Accounting Standards to CET1 
capital is provided in the “Reconciliation of equity under IFRS Accounting Standards to Swiss SRB common equity tier 1 
capital” table. 
Our CET1 capital increased by USD 33.0bn to USD 78.5bn as of 31 December 2023, predominantly due to an operating 
profit before tax (excluding negative goodwill) of USD 1.0bn, the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, which resulted 
in an increase of USD 34.9bn as of the acquisition date (including transitional CET1 purchase price allocation adjustments 
of USD 5.0bn, net of tax), an increase in eligible deferred tax assets on temporary differences of USD 1.9bn, primarily in 
connection with our business planning process and an election to capitalize compensation-related costs for US tax 
purposes, and positive effects from foreign currency translation of USD 1.5bn, partly offset by dividend accruals of 
USD 2.2bn, current tax expense of USD 1.6bn, share repurchases of USD 1.3bn under our share repurchase programs, 
amortization of transitional CET1 PPA adjustments (interest rate and own credit) of USD 0.7bn (net of tax), and an 
increase in compensation- and own shares-related components of USD 0.3bn.
› Refer to “UBS shares” in this section for more information about our share repurchase programs
Our loss-absorbing AT1 capital increased by USD 1.0bn to USD 13.9bn, mainly reflecting two issuances of AT1 capital 
instruments of USD 3.5bn and positive impacts from interest rate risk hedge, foreign currency translation and other 
effects. These increases were partly offset by USD 3.0bn equivalent of AT1 capital instruments that ceased to be eligible 
as going concern capital when we issued notice of redemption of the instruments during 2023. 
AT1 capital instruments issued from the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023 are currently subject to write-down 
upon occurrence of a trigger event or a viability event. The notes provide, however, that, following approval of a minimum 
amount of conversion capital by UBS Group AG’s shareholders at the 2024 Annual General Meeting, upon the occurrence 
of a trigger event or a viability event, the notes will be converted into UBS Group AG ordinary shares rather than being 
subject to a write-down.
Gone concern loss-absorbing capacity and movement
Audited | Our total gone concern loss-absorbing capacity increased by USD 60.1bn to USD 107.1bn as of 31 December 2023 
and included USD 106.6bn of TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt. 
The increase of USD 60.1bn mainly reflected the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as USD 53.6bn equivalent of 
TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt instruments originally issued by the Credit Suisse Group were assumed as gone 
concern capital by the UBS Group, and new issuances of USD 13.4bn equivalent of TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt 
instruments. The aforementioned increases were partly offset by the redemption of USD 6.0bn equivalent of TLACeligible senior unsecured debt instruments, amortization of a USD 0.8bn senior unsecured debt instrument that ceased 
to be TLAC-eligible as its residual time to maturity fell below one year, and a partial repurchase of two TLAC-eligible 
senior unsecured debt instruments under a tender offer (in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, UBS 
announced on 22 March 2023 a tender offer to repurchase two TLAC-eligible senior unsecured debt instruments, both 
issued on 17 March 2023, with an initial nominal amount totaling EUR 2.8bn, at their respective re-offer prices; the 
nominal amounts of the two instruments bought back under the tender offer totaled an equivalent of USD 0.8bn). In 
addition, a USD 2.4bn low-trigger loss-absorbing tier 2 capital instrument ceased to be eligible as gone concern capital 
as it had less than one year to maturity.
Loss-absorbing capacity and leverage ratios
Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 14.4% from 14.2%, reflecting the aforementioned increase in CET1 capital, partly 
offset by a USD 226.9bn increase in RWA.
Our CET1 leverage ratio increased to 4.6% from 4.4% due to the increase in CET1 capital, partly offset by a USD 666.9bn 
increase in the LRD.
Our gone concern loss-absorbing capacity ratio increased to 19.6% from 14.7%, due to an increase in gone concern 
loss-absorbing capacity of USD 60.1bn, partly offset by the aforementioned increase in RWA.
Our gone concern leverage ratio increased to 6.3% from 4.6%, driven by the aforementioned increase in gone concern 
loss-absorbing capacity, partly offset by the increase in the LRD.

Additional information
Active management of sensitivity to foreign exchange movements
Group Treasury is mandated to minimize adverse effects from changes in foreign currency rates on our CET1 capital 
and / or CET1 capital ratio. A significant portion of our CET1 capital and RWA is denominated in Swiss francs, euro, 
pounds sterling and other currencies. In order to hedge the CET1 capital ratio, CET1 capital needs to have foreign currency 
exposure, leading to foreign currency rates sensitivity of CET1 capital. 
Consequently, it is not possible to simultaneously fully hedge CET1 capital and the CET1 capital ratio. As the proportion 
of RWA denominated in currencies other than the US dollar outweighs CET1 capital in such currencies, a significant 
appreciation of the US dollar against such currencies could benefit our capital ratios, while a significant depreciation of 
the US dollar against these currencies could adversely affect our capital ratios.
The Group Asset and Liability Committee, a committee of the Group Executive Board, has mandated Group Treasury to 
adjust the currency mix of CET1 capital, within limits set by the BoD, to balance the effect of foreign exchange movements 
on CET1 capital and the CET1 capital ratio. Limits are in place for the sensitivity of both CET1 capital and the CET1 capital 
ratio to an appreciation or depreciation of 10% in the value of the US dollar against other currencies.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Capital management 166
Sensitivity to currency movements 
Risk-weighted assets
We estimate that a 10% depreciation of the US dollar against other currencies would have increased our RWA by USD 
24bn and our CET1 capital by USD 2.6bn as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: USD 13bn and USD 1.4bn, 
respectively) and decreased our CET1 capital ratio by 13 basis points (31 December 2022: 13 basis points).
Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the US dollar against other currencies would have decreased our RWA by USD 
21bn and our CET1 capital by USD 2.4bn (31 December 2022: USD 12bn and USD 1.3bn, respectively) and increased 
our CET1 capital ratio by 13 basis points (31 December 2022: 13 basis points).
Leverage ratio denominator
Our leverage ratio is also sensitive to foreign exchange movements as a result of the currency mix of our capital and LRD. 
When adjusting the currency mix in capital, potential effects on the going concern leverage ratio are taken into account 
and the sensitivity of the going concern leverage ratio to an appreciation or depreciation of 10% in the value of the US 
dollar against other currencies is actively monitored.
We estimate that a 10% depreciation of the US dollar against other currencies would have increased our LRD by 
USD 114bn as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: USD 63bn) and decreased our CET1 leverage ratio by 15 basis 
points (31 December 2022: 12 basis points). Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the US dollar against other currencies 
would have decreased our LRD by USD 103bn (31 December 2022: USD 57bn) and increased our CET1 leverage ratio by 
15 basis points (31 December 2022: 12 basis points).
The aforementioned sensitivities do not consider foreign currency translation effects related to defined benefit plans 
other than those related to the currency translation of the net equity of foreign operations.
Estimated effect on capital from litigation, regulatory and similar matters subject to provisions and contingent liabilities
We have estimated the loss in capital that we could incur as a result of the risks associated with the matters described in 
“Note 18 Provisions and contingent liabilities” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report. We have 
employed for this purpose the advanced measurement approach (AMA) methodology that we use when determining 
the capital requirements associated with operational risks, based on a 99.9% confidence level over a 12-month horizon. 
The methodology takes into consideration UBS and industry experience for the AMA operational risk categories to which 
those matters correspond, as well as the external environment affecting risks of these types, in isolation from other areas. 
On this basis, we estimate the maximum loss in capital that we could incur over a 12-month period as a result of our 
risks associated with these operational risk categories at USD 4.0bn as of 31 December 2023. This estimate is not related 
to and does not take into account any provisions recognized for any of these matters and does not constitute a subjective 
assessment of our actual exposure in any of these matters.

Capital and capital ratios of our significant regulated subsidiaries
UBS Group AG is a holding company conducting substantially all operations through UBS AG, Credit Suisse AG and 
subsidiaries thereof. UBS Group AG, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG have contributed a significant portion of their 
respective capital to, and provided substantial liquidity to, subsidiaries. Many of these subsidiaries are subject to 
regulations requiring compliance with minimum capital, liquidity and similar requirements. Regulatory capital 
components and capital ratios of our significant regulated subsidiaries determined under the regulatory framework of 
each subsidiary’s home jurisdiction are provided in the “Financial and regulatory key figures for our significant regulated 
subsidiaries and sub-groups” section of this report. Supervisory authorities generally have discretion to impose higher 
requirements, or to otherwise limit the activities of subsidiaries. Supervisory authorities also may require entities to 
measure capital and leverage ratios on a stressed basis, and may limit the ability of the entity to engage in new activities 
or take capital actions based on the results of those tests.

Joint liability of UBS AG and UBS Switzerland AG
In June 2015, upon the transfer of the Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth Management businesses booked 
in Switzerland from UBS AG to UBS Switzerland AG, UBS AG and UBS Switzerland AG assumed joint liability for 
obligations transferred to UBS Switzerland AG and existing at UBS AG, respectively. Under certain circumstances, the 
Swiss Banking Act and FINMA’s Banking Insolvency Ordinance authorize FINMA to modify, extinguish or convert to 
common equity liabilities of a bank in connection with a resolution or insolvency of such bank.
The joint liability amounts have declined as obligations matured, terminated or were novated following the transfer date. 
As of 31 December 2023, the liability of UBS Switzerland AG amounted to CHF 2.8bn (USD 3.3bn), a decrease of 
CHF 1.2bn (USD 1.0bn) compared with 31 December 2022. The respective liability of UBS AG has been substantially 
extinguished.

RWA development in 2023
During 2023, RWA increased by USD 226.9bn to USD 546.5bn, primarily due to a USD 237.7bn increase resulting from 
the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Excluding that acquisition, RWA decreased by USD 10.8bn, primarily driven 
by decreases of USD 19.0bn due to asset size and other movements and USD 3.7bn due to model updates and 
methodology changes, partly offset by an increase of USD 11.8bn due to currency effects.

effects, model updates and methodology changes or asset size and other changes. 3 Includes settlement risk, credit valuation adjustments, equity and investments in funds exposures in the banking book, and 
securitization exposures in the banking book. 4 Non-counterparty-related risk includes deferred tax assets recognized for temporary differences, property, equipment, software and other items.
Credit and counterparty credit risk
Credit and counterparty credit risk RWA increased by USD 144.8bn to USD 345.3bn as of 31 December 2023, primarily 
due to a USD 152.4bn increase resulting from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
Excluding that acquisition, credit and counterparty credit risk RWA decreased by USD 7.6bn, driven by a USD 20.1bn 
decrease related to asset size and other movements, mainly due to lower RWA in Non-core and Legacy, primarily driven 
by an accelerated roll-off arising from our actions to actively unwind the portfolio, in addition to the natural roll-off, as 
well as lower RWA from loans in Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking. These decreases were 
partly offset by currency effects of USD 11.0bn and an increase of USD 1.5bn from model updates and methodology 
changes, driven by increases related to various updates, most notably due to updates for private equity and hedge fund 
financing trades, as well as for derivatives and securities financing transaction models, partly offset by decreases related 
to the recalibration of certain multipliers as a result of our improvements to models.

Non-counterparty-related risk
Non-counterparty-related risk RWA increased by USD 10.1bn, primarily due to a USD 6.7bn increase resulting from the 
acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Excluding that acquisition, non-counterparty-related risk RWA increased by 
USD 3.4bn, mainly driven by higher RWA from deferred taxes on temporary differences.
Market risk
Market risk RWA increased by USD 7.9bn to USD 21.4bn as of 31 December 2023, primarily due to a USD 9.5bn increase 
resulting from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Excluding that acquisition, market risk RWA decreased by 
USD 1.6bn, driven by a decrease of USD 1.4bn from asset size and other movements and a decrease of USD 0.2bn related 
to ongoing parameter updates of the value-at-risk (VaR) model. FINMA approved the integration of time decay into 
regulatory VaR and stressed VaR, which went live on 12 January 2024.

Operational risk 
Operational risk RWA increased by USD 64.0bn to USD 145.4bn as of 31 December 2023, primarily due to a USD 69.0bn 
increase resulting from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. The aggregation of the advanced measurement 
approach (AMA) model considering diversification effects resulted in a USD 10.0bn reduction in RWA, of which 
USD 5.0bn was reflected in the acquisition balance of the Credit Suisse Group and USD 5.0bn was included as a model 
update.

information about the AMA model
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Capital management 168
Outlook
We expect that model updates will result in an RWA increase of around USD 10bn in 2024 and 2025, primarily as a result 
of the migration of Credit Suisse portfolios to UBS models. The extent and timing of RWA changes may vary as model 
updates are completed and receive regulatory approval, along with changes in the composition of the relevant portfolios. 
In addition, we currently estimate that the revised Basel III framework, including the Fundamental Review of the Trading 
Book, will lead to a further increase in RWA of approximately USD 25bn, of which USD 10bn is in Non-core and Legacy. 
This estimate is based on static balances and on our current understanding of the relevant standards before taking into 
account mitigating actions and not reflecting the impact of the output floor, which is phased in over time. It may change 
as a result of new or updated regulatory interpretations, appropriate conservatism in model calibration, the 
implementation of Basel III standards into national law, changes in business growth, market conditions and other factors. 
The core business-led reductions in RWA, coupled with the run-down of positions in the Non-core and Legacy business 
division, are expected to more than offset the effects of model updates and revised Basel III standards in 2024 and 2025.

The LRD movements described below exclude currency effects. 
On-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives and securities financing transactions) increased by USD 463.7bn, 
primarily due to a USD 464.2bn increase resulting from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Excluding that 
acquisition, on-balance sheet exposures decreased by USD 0.5bn, mainly due to lower lending balances, partly offset by 
higher central bank balances and trading portfolio assets.
Derivatives exposures increased by USD 37.7bn, primarily due to a USD 48.8bn increase resulting from the acquisition of 
the Credit Suisse Group. Excluding that acquisition, derivative exposures decreased by USD 11.0bn, mainly reflecting 
market-driven movements and lower trading volumes across products.
Securities financing transactions exposures increased by USD 65.5bn, primarily due to a USD 63.5bn increase resulting 
from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Excluding that acquisition, security financing transactions increased by 
USD 2.0bn.
Off-balance sheet items exposures increased by USD 43.0bn, primarily due to a USD 64.6bn increase resulting from the 
acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Excluding that acquisition, off-balance sheet items exposures decreased by 
USD 21.6bn, mainly due to a decrease in loan commitments in Non-core and Legacy, following the accounting 
reclassification of loan commitments from accrual to fair value.

Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Liquidity and funding management 170
Liquidity and funding management
We manage the structural risks of our balance sheet, including interest rate risk, structural foreign exchange risk and 
collateral risk, as well as liquidity and funding risk. This section provides information about liquidity and funding regulatory 
requirements, governance, management (including sources of liquidity and funding), contingency planning, and stress 
testing. The balances disclosed in this section represent year-end positions, unless indicated otherwise. Intra-period 
balances fluctuate in the ordinary course of business and may differ from year-end positions.
Following the completion of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, Credit Suisse became part of the overall liquidity 
and funding management of the UBS Group. Credit Suisse now leverages the market access of UBS and engages in 
secured intercompany transactions to facilitate funding between entities. 
The UBS Group is managed as an aggregate of UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG. The subsections on liquidity and funding 
stress testing and funding management describe the management implemented at UBS AG. The underlying frameworks 
and models have been materially aligned and are subject to further alignment as the integration progresses. For details 
on the management of Credit Suisse AG, please refer to the Credit Suisse AG Annual Report 2023.
Strategy, objectives and governance
Audited | Our management of liquidity and funding has the overall objective of protecting our business franchises and 
prudently managing our internal and regulatory liquidity and funding requirements. We measure liquidity and funding 
risk using internal and regulatory models and metrics. We define and implement internal stress testing across different 
time horizons, scenarios and currencies to ensure we have sufficient liquidity and funding, while remaining compliant 
with regulatory requirements, primarily expressed through the liquidity coverage ratio (the LCR) and the net stable 
funding ratio (the NSFR). Our liquidity and funding strategy is proposed by Group Treasury and approved by the Group 
Asset and Liability Committee (the Group ALCO), which is a committee of the Group Executive Board (the GEB) that is 
overseen by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the BoD).
Liquidity and funding limits and other indicators (including early-warning indicators) are set at Group and, where 
appropriate, at legal entity and business-division levels. Key limits (under BoD authority) and indicators linked to 
these limits are reviewed and reconfirmed at least once a year by the BoD, the GEB, the Group ALCO, the Group 
Chief Financial Officer, the Group Chief Risk Officer and the Group Treasurer, taking into consideration the Group’s 
business strategy and risk appetite. Treasury Risk Control provides independent oversight over liquidity and funding 
risk. 
› Refer to the “Corporate governance” and “Risk management and control” sections of this report for more information
Group Treasury monitors and oversees the implementation and execution of our liquidity and funding strategy and 
manages liquidity and funding risk within the limits and other relevant indicators, thereby adhering to the internal risk 
appetite and regulatory requirements. This includes close control of both our cash and collateral, including our highquality liquid assets (HQLA), and centralizes the Group’s access to wholesale cash markets in Group Treasury. To 
complement our business-as-usual management, Group Treasury maintains a Contingency Funding Plan and contributes 
to plans for recovery and resolution to define procedures throughout the crisis continuum. Group Treasury reports on 
the Group’s liquidity and funding status and position, at least monthly, to the Group ALCO and the Risk Committee of 
the BoD.
Liquidity and funding stress testing
Audited | Our liquidity and funding risk management aims to ensure that the firm has sufficient liquidity and funding to 
survive a severe idiosyncratic and market-wide liquidity and funding stress event without government support, allowing 
for discrete management actions. 
Group Treasury maintains a diversified, high-quality pool of unencumbered liquid assets under Treasury control. The 
liquid asset portfolio is managed dynamically, so as to operate at all times within the internal risk appetite and other 
relevant Group and subsidiary liquidity and funding requirements. 
Our liquidity and funding stress testing covers two main stress scenarios: a combined (market and idiosyncratic) scenario 
and a structural market-wide scenario. We continuously refine stress-testing assumptions.
› Refer to “Risk measurement” in the “Risk management and control” section of this report for more information about stress 
testing
› Refer to “Liquidity and funding stress testing” in the “Liquidity and funding management” section of the Credit Suisse AG Annual 
Report 2023 for more information about liquidity and funding stress testing at Credit Suisse AG
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Liquidity and funding management 171
Combined (market and idiosyncratic) scenario
In this scenario, UBS faces the consequences of both a severely deteriorated macroeconomic and financial market 
environment and a UBS-specific event, resulting in an acute loss of liquidity over a relatively short period of time. This 
scenario represents severe yet plausible events encompassing both market-wide and idiosyncratic elements, in which, 
however, franchise client relationships are materially maintained.
The risk appetite objective of this stress test is to ensure that UBS keeps a cumulative liquidity surplus on each day in the 
three-month stress horizon. The liquidity gap is assessed by modeling the stressed liquidity value of the liquidity buffer 
and stressed liquidity inflows and outflows under the scenario.
Structural market-wide scenario
In this scenario, UBS is subject to a significant deterioration of macroeconomic and financial market conditions globally, 
resulting in a requirement for long-term funding to survive the liquidity drain and support the franchise of the business. 
Macroeconomic shocks result in deteriorated financial market conditions over the scenario horizon of one year. UBS is 
assumed to be affected equally relative to other global financial institutions.
The risk appetite objective of this stress test is to ensure that UBS maintains a positive cumulative behavioral liquidity gap 
across the 3-month, 6-month, 9-month and 12-month tenors. The liquidity gap is assessed by modeling the stressed 
liquidity value of the liquidity buffer, and stressed liquidity inflows and outflows under the scenario. 
Funding management
Audited | Group Treasury monitors our funding position, including concentration risk, aiming to ensure that we maintain a 
well-balanced and diversified liability structure. Our funding management team looks to create the optimal liability 
structure to finance our businesses in a reliable and cost-efficient manner. Our funding activities are planned by analyzing 
the overall liquidity and funding requirements, taking into account the amount of stable funding that would be needed 
to support ongoing business activities through periods of difficult market conditions. 
The funding strategy of UBS Group AG is set annually in the Funding Plan and is reviewed on an ongoing basis. The 
Funding Plan is developed by Group Treasury and approved by the Group ALCO.
› Refer to “Balance sheet and off-balance sheet” in this section for more information about the development of our short- and 
long-term debt during 2023
Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking provide significant, cost-efficient and stable sources of 
funding. These include deposits and debt issued through the Swiss central mortgage institutions and UBS’s covered bond 
programs, which use a portion of our portfolio of Swiss residential mortgages as collateral to generate long-term funding. 
In addition, we have several short-, medium- and long-term funding programs under which we issue senior unsecured 
debt and structured notes, as well as short-term debt. These programs enable UBS to source funding from institutional 
and private investors who are active in Europe, the US and Asia Pacific. Collectively, these broad product offerings and 
funding sources, together with the global scope of our business activities, support our funding stability.
Internal funding and funds transfer pricing
We use our global liquidity and funding framework to govern the liquidity management of our branches and subsidiaries. 
Group Treasury meets demands for funding by channeling funds from entities generating surplus cash to those in need 
of financing, except in circumstances where transfer restrictions exist.
Funding costs and benefits are allocated to our business divisions according to our liquidity and funding risk management 
framework. Our internal funds transfer pricing system aims to incentivize that we have the right balance of assets and 
liabilities in currencies and tenors.
Credit ratings
Credit ratings can affect the cost and availability of funding, especially from wholesale unsecured sources. Our credit 
ratings can also influence the performance of some of our businesses and the levels of client and counterparty confidence. 
Rating agencies take into account a range of factors when assessing creditworthiness and setting credit ratings. These 
include the company’s strategy, its business position and franchise value, stability and quality of earnings, capital 
adequacy, risk profile and management, liquidity management, diversification of funding sources, asset quality, and 
corporate governance. Credit ratings reflect the opinions of the rating agencies and can change at any time.
In evaluating our liquidity and funding requirements, we consider the potential effect of a reduction in our long-term 
credit ratings and a corresponding reduction in short-term ratings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, rating 
trigger clauses could result in an immediate cash settlement or the need to deliver additional collateral to counterparties 
from contractual obligations related to over-the-counter (OTC) derivative positions and other obligations. Based on our 
credit ratings as of 31 December 2023, in the event of a one-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings, we would 
have been required to provide USD 0.5bn in cash or other collateral. In the event of a two-notch reduction, it would have 
been USD 0.9bn and for a three-notch downgrade USD 1.4bn. In the two- and three-notch scenarios the collateral 
requirements predominantly relate to OTC derivative positions.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Liquidity and funding management 172
In March 2023, following the announcement of the planned acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, rating agencies took 
the following actions regarding UBS Group AG’s ratings: S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited (S&P) placed its “A–”‘ Longterm Issuer Credit Rating on Negative outlook, Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited (Fitch) placed its “A+” Long-Term Issuer 
Default Rating (IDR) on Rating Watch Negative and Moody’s Investors Service Limited (Moody’s) changed the outlook on 
its “A3” Long-term Issuer Default Rating to Negative. Upon the close of the acquisition in June 2023, Fitch downgraded 
UBS Group’s Long-Term IDR to A from A+ and changed the outlook to Stable, while Moody’s changed the outlook on 
UBS Group’s Long-term IDR to Positive. In February 2024, S&P affirmed their ratings and outlook for UBS Group.

Contingency Funding Plan
Audited | We maintain our Contingency Funding Plan as a preparation and action plan, aiming to ensure we maintain 
sufficient liquidity to meet payment obligations in a period of liquidity and funding stress. The plan specifies the processes, 
tools and responsibilities that we have available to effectively manage liquidity and funding through these periods. Our 
funding diversification and global scope help to protect our liquidity position in the event of a crisis. Our contingent 
funding sources include our HQLA portfolios, available Central Bank eligible non-HQLA collateral for liquidity facilities at 
several major central banks, contingent reductions of trading portfolio assets, and other actions available to the 
management.
Liquidity coverage ratio
The LCR measures the short-term resilience of a bank’s liquidity profile by assessing whether sufficient HQLA are available 
to meet expected net cash outflows from a significant liquidity stress scenario, as defined by the relevant regulator.
For UBS, HQLA are low-risk unencumbered assets under the control of Group Treasury that are easily and immediately 
convertible into cash at little or no loss of value, in order to meet liquidity needs. Our HQLA predominantly consist of 
assets that qualify as Level 1 in the LCR framework, including cash, central bank reserves and government bonds. Group 
HQLA are held by UBS AG and its subsidiaries and may include amounts that are available to meet funding and collateral 
needs in certain jurisdictions but are not readily available for use by the Group as a whole. These limitations are typically 
the result of local regulatory requirements, including local LCR and large exposure requirements. Funds that are effectively 
restricted in subsidiaries and branches are excluded from the calculation of Group HQLA. On this basis, USD 42.3bn of 
assets were excluded from our daily average Group HQLA for the fourth quarter of 2023. Amounts held in excess of local 
liquidity requirements that are not subject to other restrictions are generally available for transfer within the Group.
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) standards require an LCR of at least 100%. In a period of financial stress, 
the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) may allow banks to use their HQLA and let their LCR temporarily 
fall below the minimum threshold. We monitor the LCR in all significant currencies in order to manage any currency 
mismatches between HQLA and the net expected cash outflows in times of stress.
Our daily average LCR for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 215.7%, compared with 163.7% in the fourth quarter of 
2022, remaining above the prudential requirement communicated by FINMA.
The movement in the average LCR was primarily driven by an increase in HQLA of USD 177.0bn to USD 415.6bn, primarily 
related to Credit Suisse HQLA and higher cash available from debt issued and customer deposits in UBS Group excluding 
Credit Suisse. The increase in HQLA was partly offset by a USD 46.8bn increase in net cash outflows to USD 192.8bn, 
largely attributable to Credit Suisse’s net cash outflows related to customer deposits and credit commitments. These 
outflows were partly offset by lower outflows from customer deposits of UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse.
› Refer to the 31 December 2023 Pillar 3 Report, available under “Pillar 3 disclosures” at ubs.com/investors, for more information 
about the LCR

Too-big-to-fail liquidity requirements
The too-big-to-fail (TBTF) liquidity requirements communicated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority 
(FINMA) in the third quarter of 2023 became effective on 1 January 2024. The affected legal entities of the UBS Group 
are compliant with these requirements.
Net stable funding ratio
The NSFR framework is intended to limit overreliance on short-term wholesale funding, to encourage a better assessment 
of funding risk across all on- and off-balance sheet items and to promote funding stability. The NSFR has two 
components: available stable funding (ASF), as numerator, and required stable funding (RSF), as denominator. ASF is the 
portion of capital and liabilities expected to be available over the period of one year. RSF is a measure of the stable 
funding requirement of assets based on their maturity, encumbrance and other characteristics, as well as the potential 
for contingent calls on funding liquidity from off-balance sheet exposures. The BCBS NSFR regulatory framework requires 
a ratio of at least 100%.
As of 31 December 2023, the NSFR increased 4.9 percentage points to 124.7%, remaining above the prudential 
requirement communicated by FINMA.
Available stable funding increased by USD 365.0bn to USD 926.4bn, predominantly driven by the acquisition of the 
Credit Suisse Group, mainly reflecting debt issued, customer deposits and regulatory capital. The increase in UBS Group 
excluding Credit Suisse was predominantly driven by higher customer deposits and debt issued.
Required stable funding increased by USD 274.7bn to USD 743.2bn, substantially reflecting the acquisition of the Credit 
Suisse Group. This balance predominantly includes lending assets and, to a lesser extent, trading portfolio assets and 
derivative balances. Required stable funding in UBS Group excluding Credit Suisse increased, mainly driven by higher 
lending assets, including currency effects, and higher trading portfolio assets.

Balance sheet
Balance sheet assets
As of 31 December 2023, balance sheet assets totaled USD 1,717.2bn, an increase of USD 612.9bn compared with 
31 December 2022, which was mainly driven by the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, which contributed 
USD 604.1bn in June 2023.
Cash and balances at central banks increased by USD 144.7bn to USD 314.1bn. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse 
Group in June 2023 contributed USD 93.0bn, mainly in balances with the Swiss National Bank (the SNB) and the Federal 
Reserve. Excluding the effects of that acquisition, balances with central banks increased by USD 51.7bn during 2023, 
driven by inflows from higher customer deposits, lower lending and net new issuances of short-term debt and debt issued 
designated at fair value, as well as currency effects. These inflows were partly offset by repayment of funding from the 
SNB and other outflows.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Balance sheet and off-balance sheet 174
Lending assets increased by USD 259.0bn to USD 661.0bn, predominantly reflecting the acquisition of the Credit Suisse 
Group, which added USD 260.8bn in June 2023. Excluding the increase from the addition in June, Lending assets 
decreased by USD 1.8bn during 2023, mainly reflecting net new loan outflows of USD 37.0bn, partly offset by currency 
effects. Securities financing transactions at amortized cost increased by USD 31.2bn to USD 99.0bn, of which 
USD 26.2bn related to balances acquired from the Credit Suisse Group in June 2023. Excluding the effects of that 
acquisition, the increase mainly reflects net new excess cash reinvestment trades. Trading assets increased by USD 61.7bn 
to USD 169.6bn, including USD 56.2bn reflecting the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in June 2023. Excluding the 
additions from that acquisition, the increase mainly reflected higher inventory held to hedge client positions and marketdriven movements, partly offset by the wind-down of the Credit Suisse business in Non-Core and Legacy.
Derivatives and cash collateral receivables on derivative instruments increased by USD 41.1bn to USD 226.2bn. The 
increase related mainly to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, which added USD 83.0bn in June 2023, including 
USD 20.9bn of cash collateral receivables. Excluding the effects of that acquisition, balances decreased by USD 42bn, 
mainly in Derivatives & Solutions and Financing in the Investment Bank, predominantly reflecting decreases in foreign 
exchange contracts, where the contracts in place at the end of 2023 had lower fair values than the contracts in place at 
the end of 2022, as well as decreases in interest rate contracts, mainly reflecting valuation effects due to decreases in 
long-term interest rates. In addition, the unwinding of the Credit Suisse business in Non-core and Legacy contributed to 
the decrease.
Other financial assets measured at amortized cost increased by USD 12.2bn to USD 65.5bn, mostly related to the 
acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, which added USD 13.4bn, reflecting finance lease receivables, as well as cash 
collateral provided to exchanges and clearing houses to secure securities trading activity through those counterparties. 
Other financial assets measured at fair value increased by USD 44.3bn to USD 106.3bn. Excluding the effects of the 
acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, which added USD 54.2bn in June 2023, balances decreased by USD 9.9bn, mainly 
reflecting the wind-down of the Credit Suisse business in Non-core and Legacy, partly offset by higher securities financing 
transactions measured at fair value in Group Treasury. Non-financial assets increased by USD 15.3bn to USD 54.5bn, 
mainly driven by positions acquired from the Credit Suisse Group, which were USD 16.8bn as of the acquisition date and 
mainly included leased and owned properties and equipment, investments in associates, and prepaid expenses, as well 
as physical holdings of precious metals.

Asset encumbrance
The table below provides a breakdown of on- and off-balance sheet assets between encumbered assets, unencumbered 
assets and assets that cannot be pledged as collateral.
Assets are presented as Encumbered if they have been pledged as collateral against an existing liability or are otherwise 
not available for securing additional funding. Included within the latter category are assets protected under client asset 
segregation rules, financial assets for unit-linked investment contracts, and assets held in certain jurisdictions to comply 
with explicit minimum local asset maintenance requirements.
Assets that cannot be pledged as collateral represent assets that are not encumbered but by their nature are not 
considered available to secure funding or meet collateral needs.
All other assets are presented as Unencumbered. This category consists of cash and securities readily realizable in the 
normal course of business, which include our high-quality liquid assets and unencumbered positions in our trading 
portfolio. In addition, unencumbered assets include loans and advances to customers and amounts due from banks. 
Unencumbered assets that are considered to be available to secure funding at the legal entity level may be subject to 
restrictions that limit the total amount of assets available to the Group as a whole.

Balance sheet liabilities
Total liabilities as of 31 December 2023 were USD 1,630.6bn, an increase of USD 583.5bn compared with 31 December 
2022, which was mainly driven by the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
Short-term borrowings increased by USD 68.2bn to USD 109.5bn. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group added 
USD 112.9bn in June 2023, including USD 97.2bn of funding from the SNB. Excluding the effects of the addition of 
Credit Suisse balances, short-term borrowings decreased by USD 44.7bn, mainly driven by the repayment of USD 56.5bn 
of funding from the Swiss National Bank. This decrease was partly offset by net new issuances of commercial paper and 
certificates of deposit in Group Treasury, as well as an increase in funding obtained from the US Federal Home Loan 
Banks. Securities financing transactions at amortized cost increased by USD 10.2bn to USD 14.4bn, mainly driven by the 
acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, which added USD 11.9bn in June 2023.
Customer deposits increased by USD 266.9bn to USD 792.0bn. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group contributed 
USD 183.1bn in June 2023. Excluding the effects of that acquisition, the increase of USD 83.8bn was mainly due to 
currency effects of approximately USD 31.3bn and net inflows into fixed-term deposit products in Global Wealth 
Management and Personal & Corporate Banking, partly offset by continued shifts into money market funds and USgovernment securities.
Debt issued designated at fair value and long-term debt issued measured at amortized cost increased by USD 169.0bn 
to USD 327.6bn. The increase mainly related to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, which added USD 150.1bn 
to the Group. Excluding the effects of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, Debt issued designated at fair value 
and long-term debt issued measured at amortized cost increased by USD 18.9bn, mainly reflecting net new issuances of 
Debt issued designated at fair value in Derivatives & Solutions, as well as net new issuances of senior unsecured debt, 
including total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC)-eligible instruments, and loss-absorbing tier 1 capital instruments. 
In December 2023, we announced our intention to call one high-trigger loss-absorbing tier 1 capital instrument of 
USD 2.5bn, which was redeemed in January 2024.

Derivatives and cash collateral payables on derivative instruments increased by USD 42.4bn to USD 233.8bn, including 
USD 78.7bn recognized in June 2023 with the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, of which USD 10.9bn was cash 
collateral payables. Excluding that acquisition, balances decreased by USD 36.3bn, reflecting the same drivers as on the 
asset side.
Other financial liabilities measured at amortized cost increased by USD 11.3bn to USD 20.9bn. The balances of USD 8.0bn 
added with the acquisition of Credit Suisse Group in June 2023 mainly included accrued expenses and lease liabilities. 
Excluding the effects of that acquisition, balances increased mainly due to higher interest accruals. Non-financial liabilities 
increased by USD 14.1bn to USD 26.3bn. The increase mainly related to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, which 
added USD 13.8bn in June 2023, mainly representing provisions and contingent liabilities, compensation-related liabilities 
and deferred tax liabilities.
Equity
Equity attributable to shareholders increased by USD 29,232m to USD 86,108m as of 31 December 2023. 
The increase of USD 29,232m was mainly driven by total comprehensive income attributable to shareholders of 
USD 28,836m, reflecting net profit of USD 27,849m, which included the recognition of negative goodwill on the 
acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group of USD 27,748m, and other comprehensive income (OCI) of USD 986m. OCI mainly 
included OCI related to foreign currency translation of USD 1,456m, cash flow hedge OCI of USD 1,275m and negative 
OCI related to own credit on financial liabilities designated at fair value of USD 1,769m. In addition, deferred share-based 
compensation awards of USD 1,097m were expensed in the income statement, increasing share premium.
Net treasury share activity increased equity by USD 745m. This was mainly due to the consideration of USD 3,547m used 
to acquire the Credit Suisse Group, largely offset by share repurchases with an acquisition cost of USD 1,279m under 
our 2022 share repurchase program and purchases of USD 1,258m from the market to hedge our share delivery 
obligations related to employee share-based compensation awards. 
These increases were partly offset by distributions to shareholders of USD 1,679m, reflecting a dividend payment of 
USD 0.55 per share.
In the second quarter of 2023, we canceled 62,548,000 shares purchased under our 2021 share repurchase program, as 
approved by shareholders at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (the AGM). The cancellation of shares resulted in 
reclassifications within equity but had no net effect on our total equity attributable to shareholders.
At the 2023 AGM, the shareholders also approved the change of the share capital currency of UBS Group AG from the 
Swiss franc to the US dollar. As a result, the nominal value per share has changed from CHF 0.10 to USD 0.10, resulting 
in a reclassification between share capital and capital contribution reserve (presented as share premium in the 
consolidated financial statements). Total equity reported was not affected by this change.

Off-balance sheet
In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions where, pursuant to IFRS Accounting Standards, the maximum 
contractual exposure may not be recognized in whole or in part on our balance sheet. These transactions include 
derivative instruments, guarantees, loan commitments and similar arrangements.
When we incur an obligation or become entitled to an asset through these arrangements, we recognize them on the 
balance sheet. It should be noted that in certain instances the amount recognized on the balance sheet does not represent 
the full gain or loss potential inherent in such arrangements.
The following paragraphs provide more information about certain off-balance sheet arrangements. Additional offbalance sheet information is primarily provided in Notes 10, 11, 18, 20, 21h, 23 and 29 in the “Consolidated financial 
statements” section of this report and in the 31 December 2023 Pillar 3 Report, available under “Pillar 3 disclosures” at
ubs.com/investors.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Balance sheet and off-balance sheet 178
Guarantees, loan commitments and similar arrangements
In the normal course of business, we issue various forms of guarantees, commitments to extend credit, standby and other 
letters of credit to support our clients, forward starting transactions, note issuance facilities, and revolving underwriting 
facilities. With the exception of related premiums, generally these guarantees and similar obligations are kept as offbalance sheet items, unless a provision to cover probable losses or expected credit losses is required.
Guarantees represent irrevocable assurances that, subject to the satisfying of certain conditions, we will make payments 
if our clients fail to fulfill their obligations to third parties. As of 31 December 2023, the net exposure (i.e., gross values 
less sub-participations) from guarantees and similar instruments was USD 43.9bn, compared with USD 20.6bn as of 
31 December 2022. The increase of USD 23.3bn was mainly driven by the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group and an 
increase in sponsored repo clearing in Group Treasury. Fee income from issuing guarantees compared with total net fee 
and commission income is insignificant for both 2023 and 2022.
We also enter into commitments to extend credit in the form of credit lines available to secure the liquidity needs of 
clients. The majority of irrevocable loan commitments range in maturity from one month to three years. During 2023, 
Irrevocable loan commitments increased by USD 51.6bn to USD 91.6bn and Committed unconditionally revocable credit 
lines increased by USD 121.9bn to USD 163.3bn, with both predominantly driven by the acquisition of the Credit Suisse 
Group. Forward starting reverse repurchase agreements increased by USD 14.6bn to USD 18.4bn, mainly reflecting 
fluctuations in levels of business division activity in short-dated securities financing transactions.

1 Guarantees and irrevocable loan commitments are shown net of sub-participations. 2 Includes guarantees measured at fair value through profit or loss.
If customers fail to meet their obligations, our maximum exposure to credit risk is generally the contractual amount of 
these instruments. The risk is similar to the risk involved in extending loan facilities and is subject to the same risk 
management and control framework. In 2023, we recognized net credit loss expenses of USD 142m related to irrevocable 
loan commitments, guarantees and other credit facilities in the scope of expected credit loss measurement, compared 
with net credit loss releases of USD 3m in 2022. Provisions recognized for irrevocable loan commitments, guarantees and 
other credit facilities in the scope of expected credit loss measurement were USD 350m as of 31 December 2023, 
compared with USD 201m as of 31 December 2022.
› Refer to “Note 10 Financial assets at amortized cost and other positions in scope of expected credit loss measurement” and “Note 20 
Expected credit loss measurement” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report for more information about 
provisions for expected credit losses
For certain obligations, we enter into partial sub-participations to mitigate various risks from guarantees and irrevocable 
loan commitments. A sub-participation is an agreement by another party to take a share of the loss in the event that the 
obligation is not fulfilled by the obligor and, where applicable, to fund a part of the credit facility. We retain the 
contractual relationship with the obligor, and the sub-participant has only an indirect relationship. Generally, we only 
enter into sub-participation agreements with banks to which we ascribe a credit rating equal to or better than that of 
the obligor.
We also provide representations, warranties and indemnifications to third parties in the normal course of business.
Support provided to non-consolidated investment funds
In 2023, the Group did not provide material support, financial or otherwise, to unconsolidated investment funds when 
the Group was not contractually obligated to do so, nor does it currently have an intention to do so.
Clearing house and exchange memberships
We are a member of numerous securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses. In connection with some of 
these memberships, we may be required to pay a share of the financial obligations of another member who defaults, or 
we may be otherwise exposed to additional financial obligations. While the membership rules vary, obligations generally 
would arise only if the exchange or clearing house had exhausted its resources. We consider the probability of a material 
loss due to such obligations to be remote.
Deposit insurance
Swiss banking law and the deposit insurance system require Swiss banks and securities dealers to jointly guarantee an 
amount of up to CHF 8bn for privileged client deposits in the event that a Swiss bank or securities dealer becomes 
insolvent. As of 31 December 2023, FINMA estimates our share in the deposit insurance system to be CHF 1.8bn. This 
represents a contingent payment obligation and exposes us to additional risk. As of 31 December 2023, we considered 
the probability of a material loss from our obligations to be remote.
UBS is also subject to, or is a member of, other deposit protection schemes in other countries. However, no contingent 
payment obligation existed as of 31 December 2023 from any other material scheme.
Annual Report 2023 | Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet | Balance sheet and off-balance sheet 179
Material cash requirements
The Group’s material cash requirements as of 31 December 2023 are represented by the residual contractual maturities 
for non-derivative and non-trading financial liabilities included in the table presented in “Note 24b Maturity analysis of 
financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report. Included 
in the table are debt issued designated at fair value (USD 149.8bn) and debt issued measured at amortized cost 
(USD 279.3bn). The amounts represent estimated future interest and principal payments on an undiscounted basis.
In the normal course of business, we also issue or enter into various forms of guarantees, loan commitments and other 
similar arrangements that may result in an outflow of cash in the future. The maturity profile of these obligations, which 
are presented off-balance sheet, are included in “Note 24b Maturity analysis of financial liabilities on an undiscounted 
basis” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report. Refer to “Guarantees, loan commitments and 
similar arrangements” in this section for more information.
Cash flows
As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and often may bear little relation to our net earnings and net 
assets. Consequently, we believe that a traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful when evaluating our liquidity 
position than the liquidity, funding and capital management frameworks and measures described elsewhere in this 
section.

Refer to “Liquidity and funding management” in this section for more information
Cash and cash equivalents
As of 31 December 2023, cash and cash equivalents totaled USD 340.3bn, an increase of USD 145.0bn compared with 
31 December 2022, driven by net cash inflows from investing and operating activities and positive foreign exchange 
effects, largely reflecting the depreciation of the US dollar against the Swiss franc in 2023. These effects were partly 
offset by net cash outflows used in financing activities in amount of USD 58.3bn.
Operating activities
Net cash inflows from operating activities were USD 86.1bn in 2023, compared with USD 14.6bn in 2022. The net change 
in operating assets and liabilities of 88.3bn was mainly driven by a USD 52.8bn increase in customer deposits, a 
USD 27.9bn decrease in loans and advances to customers and a USD 9.9bn change in financial assets and liabilities at 
fair value not held for trading and other financial assets and liabilities. These effects were partly offset by smaller 
movements in other operating assets and liabilities and adjustments to remove the net impact of non-cash effects in the 
balance sheet, such as foreign currency effects. 
Investing activities
Investing activities resulted in a net cash inflow of USD 103.2bn in 2023, compared with a net outflow of USD 12.4bn 
in 2022, primarily reflecting the effect of cash acquired upon the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in the amount 
of USD 108.5bn, partly offset by outflows from purchases of debt securities measured at amortized cost of USD 3.8bn.
Financing activities
Financing activities resulted in a net cash outflow of USD 58.3bn in 2023, compared with an outflow of USD 9.1bn in 2022, 
mainly due to the repayment of USD 56.5bn of funding from the Swiss National Bank, net cash used to repurchase treasury 
shares of USD 2.8bn and a dividend distribution to shareholders of USD 1.7bn. These outflows were partly offset by net 
issuance proceeds from short-term debt measured at amortized cost of USD 3.2bn and from debt designated at fair value 
and long-term debt measured at amortized cost of USD 0.3bn.

Currency management
Strategy, objectives and governance
Group Treasury focuses on three main areas of currency risk management: (i) currency-matched funding and investment 
of non-US-dollar assets and liabilities; (ii) the sell-down of foreign currency IFRS Accounting Standards profits and losses; 
and (iii) selective hedging of anticipated non-US-dollar profits and losses to further mitigate the effect of structural 
imbalances in the balance sheet. Group Treasury also manages structural currency composition across three scopes: UBS 
Group AG consolidated, UBS AG consolidated and Credit Suisse AG consolidated.
Currency-matched funding and investment of non-US-dollar assets and liabilities
For monetary balance sheet items and other investments, as far as is practical and efficient, we follow the principle of 
matching the currencies of our assets and liabilities for funding purposes. This avoids profits and losses arising from the 
translation of non-US-dollar assets and liabilities.
UBS Group AG consolidated and UBS AG consolidated apply net investment hedge accounting to non-US-dollar core 
investments, while Credit Suisse AG consolidated applies it to its non-Swiss Franc core investments to balance the effect 
of foreign exchange movements on both common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and the CET1 capital ratio.
› Refer to “Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies” and “Note 26 Hedge accounting” in the “Consolidated financial 
statements” section of this report for more information
› Refer to “Capital management” in this section for more information about our active management of sensitivity to currency 
movements and the effect thereof on our key ratios
Sell-down of non-US-dollar reported profits and losses
Income statement items of group entities with a functional currency other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars 
at average exchange rates. To reduce earnings volatility on the translation of previously recognized earnings in foreign 
currencies, Group Treasury centralizes the profits and losses (under IFRS Accounting Standards) arising in UBS AG and its 
branches and sells or buys the profit or loss for US dollars on a monthly basis. UBS AG subsidiaries and Credit Suisse AG 
branches and subsidiaries follow a similar monthly sell-down process into their own functional currencies. The retained 
earnings in subsidiaries and branches with a functional currency other than the US dollar are integrated and managed as 
part of the UBS Group’s net investment hedge accounting program.
Hedging of anticipated non-US-dollar profits and losses
The Group Asset and Liability Committee may at any time instruct Group Treasury to execute hedges to protect 
anticipated future profits and losses in foreign currencies against possible adverse trends of foreign exchange rates. 
Although intended to hedge future earnings, these transactions are accounted for as open currency positions and subject 
to internal market risk limits for value-at-risk and stress loss limits.
Dividend distribution
UBS Group AG declares dividends in US dollars. Shareholders holding shares through SIX SIS AG will receive dividends in 
Swiss francs, based on a published exchange rate calculated up to five decimal places, on the day prior to the ex-dividend 
date. Shareholders holding shares through DTC or Computershare will be paid dividends in US dollars.

UBS Group AG shares
Audited | As of 31 December 2023, equity attributable to shareholders under IFRS Accounting Standards amounted to 
USD 86,108m, represented by 3,462,087,722 shares issued. Shares issued decreased by 62,548,000 shares in 2023 as the 
shares acquired under the 2021 share repurchase program after 18 February 2022 were canceled by means of a capital 
reduction, as approved by shareholders at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (the AGM).
In the second quarter of 2023, the share capital currency of UBS Group AG was changed from the Swiss franc to the US 
dollar, as approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM. As a result, the nominal value per share has changed from CHF 0.10 
to USD 0.10, resulting in a reclassification between share capital and capital contribution reserve (presented as share 
premium in the consolidated financial statements).

Each share carries one vote if entered into the share register as having the right to vote, and also entitles the holder to a 
proportionate share of distributed dividends. All shares are fully paid up. As the Articles of Association of UBS Group AG 
indicate, there are no other classes of shares and no preferential rights for shareholders. 

Holding of UBS Group AG shares 
Group Treasury holds UBS Group AG shares to hedge future share delivery obligations related to employee share-based 
compensation awards, and also holds shares purchased under share repurchase programs. As of 31 December 2023, we 
held a total of 253,233,437 treasury shares (31 December 2022: 416,909,010).
Our 2021 share repurchase program was concluded on 29 March 2022 with the purchase of an additional 87.7m shares 
in 2022 for an acquisition cost of USD 1,637m (CHF 1,516m). The 177.8m shares repurchased under this program from 
its inception until 18 February 2022 for a total acquisition cost of USD 3,022m (CHF 2,775m) were canceled by means 
of a capital reduction in 2022, as approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM. The remaining 62,548,000 shares 
purchased under the 2021 program were canceled by means of a capital reduction in 2023, as approved by shareholders 
at the 2023 AGM.
On 31 March 2022, we commenced a new, 2022 share repurchase program of up to USD 6bn. Shares acquired under 
this program totaled 298.5m as of 31 December 2023 for a total acquisition cost of USD 5,245m (CHF 5,010m). A total 
of 178m shares repurchased under this program and originally intended for cancellation purposes were repurposed for 
the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group and 176m shares were transferred to Credit Suisse Group shareholders in an 
exchange of shares as consideration for the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. The remaining 121m shares, with a 
total acquisition cost of USD 2,277m (CHF 2,138m), are intended to be canceled by means of a capital reduction, pending 
approval by the shareholders at a future AGM.
A new, two-year share repurchase program of up to USD 6bn was approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM. We have 
temporarily suspended repurchases under the share repurchase programs due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse 
Group, but we plan to repurchase up to USD 1bn of our shares in 2024, commencing after the completion of the merger 
of UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG.
Treasury shares held to hedge our share delivery obligations related to employee share-based compensation awards 
totaled 131m shares as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 119m). Share delivery obligations related to employee 
share-based compensation awards totaled 196m shares as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 178m) and are 
calculated on the basis of undistributed notional share awards, taking applicable performance conditions into account. 
Treasury shares held are delivered to employees at exercise or vesting. As of 31 December 2023, up to 122m 
UBS Group AG shares (31 December 2022: 122m) could have been issued out of conditional capital to satisfy share 
delivery obligations of any future employee share option programs or similar awards.

1 UBS has an active share repurchase program to buy back up to USD 6bn of its own shares over the two-year period started in March 2022 and ending at the latest on 29 March 2024. The share buybacks were 
transacted in Swiss francs on a separate trading line on the SIX Swiss Exchange. A new, two-year share repurchase program of up to USD 6bn was approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM. However, we have 
temporarily suspended repurchases under the share repurchase programs due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. 2 This table excludes purchases for the purpose of hedging derivatives linked to UBS Group 
AG shares and for market-making in UBS Group AG shares. The table also excludes UBS Group AG shares purchased by post-employment benefit funds for UBS employees, which are managed by a board of UBS 
management and employee representatives in accordance with Swiss law. UBS’s post-employment benefit funds purchased 509,075 UBS Group AG shares during the year and held 13,478,820 UBS Group AG shares 
as of 31 December 2023. 3 Based on the transaction date of the respective treasury share purchases.

Listing of UBS Group AG shares
UBS Group AG shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX). They are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange 
(the NYSE) as global registered shares. As such, they can be traded and transferred across applicable borders, without 
the need for conversion, with identical shares traded on different stock exchanges in different currencies.
During 2023, the average daily trading volume of UBS Group AG shares was 8.4m shares on SIX and 0.7m shares on the 
NYSE. SIX is expected to remain the main venue for determining the movement in our share price, because of the high 
volume traded on this exchange.
During the hours in which both SIX and the NYSE are simultaneously open for trading, price differences between these 
exchanges are likely to be arbitraged away by professional market-makers. Accordingly, the share price will typically be 
similar between the two exchanges when considering the prevailing US dollar / Swiss franc exchange rate. When SIX is 
closed for trading, globally traded volumes will typically be lower. However, the specialist firm making a market in 
UBS Group AG shares on the NYSE is required to facilitate sufficient liquidity and maintain an orderly market in 
UBS Group AG shares throughout normal NYSE trading hours.

Corporate governance
UBS Group AG is subject to, and complies with, all relevant Swiss legal and regulatory requirements regarding corporate 
governance, including the SIX Swiss Exchange’s Directive on Information relating to Corporate Governance (the SIX Swiss 
Exchange Corporate Governance Directive) and the standards established in the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate 
Governance. 
Following a revision of the Swiss Code of Obligations that entered into force on 1 January 2023, the correspondingly 
amended Articles of Association of UBS Group AG (the AoA) were approved by the Annual General Meeting (the AGM) 
on 5 April 2023. The key amendments of the AoA are amendment of the threshold to convene extraordinary general 
meetings, the introduction of the basis to hold hybrid and virtual general meetings, and changes in connection with the 
external mandates of the Board of Directors (the BoD) and the Group Executive Board (the GEB), as well as compensationrelated changes and clarifications with regards to publications and notices.
As a non-US company with shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE), UBS Group AG also complies with 
all relevant corporate governance standards applicable to foreign private issuers.
The Organization Regulations of UBS Group AG, adopted by the BoD based on Art. 716b of the Swiss Code of Obligations 
and Art. 25 and 27 of the AoA, constitute UBS Group AG’s primary corporate governance guidelines. 
› Refer to the Articles of Association of UBS Group AG and to the Organization Regulations of UBS Group AG, available at 
ubs.com/governance and ubs.com/ubs-ag-governance, for more information
› The SIX Swiss Exchange Corporate Governance Directive is available at ser-ag.com/content/dam/
serag/downloads/regulation/listing/directives/dcg-en.pdf, the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance at 
economiesuisse.ch/en/publications/swiss-code-best-practice-corporate-governance and the NYSE rules at 
nyseguide.srorules.com/listed-company-manual
Differences from corporate governance standards relevant to US-listed companies
The NYSE standards on corporate governance require foreign private issuers to disclose any significant ways in which their 
corporate governance practices differ from those that have to be followed by US companies. The key differences are 
discussed below.
Responsibility of the Audit Committee regarding independent auditors
Our Audit Committee is responsible for the compensation, retention and oversight of independent auditors. It assesses the 
performance and qualifications of external auditors and submits proposals for appointment, reappointment or removal of 
independent auditors to the BoD. As required by the Swiss Code of Obligations, the BoD submits its proposals for a 
shareholder vote at the AGM. Under NYSE standards audit committees are responsible for appointing independent auditors.
Discussion of risk assessment and risk management policies by the Risk Committee
As per the Organization Regulations of UBS Group AG, the Risk Committee, instead of the Audit Committee, as per 
NYSE standards, oversees our risk principles and risk capacity on behalf of the BoD. The Risk Committee is responsible 
for monitoring our adherence to those risk principles and monitoring whether business divisions and control units 
maintain appropriate systems of risk management and control.
Supervision of the internal audit function
Although under NYSE standards only audit committees supervise internal audit functions, the Chairman of the BoD (the 
Chairman) and the Audit Committee share the supervisory responsibility and authority with respect to the internal audit 
function.
Responsibility of the Compensation Committee for performance evaluations of senior management of UBS Group AG
In line with Swiss law, our Compensation Committee, together with the BoD, proposes for shareholder approval at the 
AGM the maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the BoD, the maximum aggregate amount of fixed 
compensation for the Group Executive Board (the GEB) and the aggregate amount of variable compensation for the GEB. 
The members of the Compensation Committee are elected by the AGM. Under NYSE standards it is the responsibility of 
compensation committees to evaluate senior management’s performance and to determine and approve, as a committee 
or together with the other independent directors, the compensation thereof.
Proxy statement reports of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee
NYSE standards require the aforementioned committees to submit their reports directly to shareholders. However, under 
Swiss law all reports to shareholders, including those from the aforementioned committees, are provided to and approved 
by the BoD, which has ultimate responsibility to the shareholders.
Shareholder votes on equity compensation plans
NYSE standards require shareholder approval for the establishing of and material revisions to all equity compensation 
plans. However, as per Swiss law, the BoD approves compensation plans. Shareholder approval is only mandatory if 
equity-based compensation plans require an increase in capital. No shareholder approval is required if shares for such 
plans are purchased in the market.

of 19 June 2015 (the FMIA), anyone who directly, indirectly or acting in concert with third parties, acquires or disposes 
of shares in a company listed in Switzerland or holds other purchase or sale positions relating to such shares, and, thereby,
directly, indirectly or in concert with third parties reaches, falls below or exceeds one of the following percentage 
thresholds: 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 331
⁄3, 50 or 662
⁄3% of the voting rights in such company, regardless of whether or not 
such rights may be exercised, must notify the company and the Swiss stock exchange on which such shares are listed. 
Nominee companies that cannot autonomously decide how voting rights are exercised are not required to notify the 
company and such stock exchange if they reach, exceed or fall below the aforementioned thresholds.
Shareholders subject to FMIA disclosure notifications
According to the mandatory FMIA disclosure notifications filed with UBS Group AG and SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX), as of 
31 December 2023, the following entities held more than 3% of the total voting rights of UBS Group AG: Norges Bank, 
Oslo, which disclosed a holding of 4.79% on 4 December 2023; BlackRock Inc., New York, which disclosed a holding of 
5.01% on 30 November 2023; and Artisan Partners Limited Partnership, Milwaukee, which disclosed a holding of 3.03% 
on 29 March 2023. 
In accordance with the FMIA, the aforementioned holdings are calculated in relation to the voting rights associated with 
the total share capital of UBS Group AG entered into the commercial register at the time of the respective disclosure 
notification. 
Information on disclosures under the FMIA is available at ser-ag.com/en/resources/notifications-marketparticipants/significant-shareholders.html. 
Cross-shareholdings
UBS Group AG has no cross-shareholdings where reciprocal ownership would be in excess of 5% of capital or voting 
rights with any other company.

Share capital structure
Ordinary share capital
On 5 April 2023, the AGM approved the conversion of the share capital currency of UBS Group AG from the Swiss franc 
to the US dollar. To obtain a Swiss franc nominal value per share equaling USD 0.10 after the conversion, the AGM also 
approved a CHF 25,896,416.16056 reduction of the ordinary share capital, and this reduction resulted in a corresponding 
allocation to the capital contribution reserve on UBS Group AG’s standalone financial statements. At the end of 2023, 
UBS Group AG had 3,462,087,722 issued shares with a nominal value of USD 0.10 each, equating to a share capital of 
USD 346,208,772.20. 
Under Swiss company law, shareholders must approve, in a general meeting of shareholders, any increase or reduction 
in the ordinary share capital, the creation of conditional share capital or the introduction of a capital band. In addition, 
under the Swiss Banking Act, shareholders of a Swiss top holding company of a financial group or of a Swiss bank must 
approve, in a general meeting of shareholders, the introduction of conversion capital or reserve capital.
In 2023, the shareholders of UBS Group AG were asked to approve a reduction of share capital by way of canceling 
62,548,000 registered shares repurchased under the 2021 share repurchase program. 
In 2023, the shareholders of UBS Group AG were not asked to approve the creation of conditional capital or the 
introduction of conversion capital, capital band or reserve capital. As of the date of this report, UBS Group AG has no 
conversion capital, capital band or reserve capital.
No shares were issued out of UBS Group AG’s existing conditional capital in 2023, as there were no employee options 
or stock appreciation rights outstanding. 
Following the permanent write down of Credit Suisse Group AG’s additional tier 1 (AT1) instruments in March 2023, 
UBS Group AG has issued AT1 instruments with terms that provide for an equity conversion feature (instead of the 
existing write-down feature) as soon as UBS Group AG has a minimum amount of conversion capital in place. In relation 
to AT1 instruments with equity conversion features, the BoD will propose at the 2024 AGM that the shareholders approve 
the introduction of conversion capital in a maximum amount equivalent to 700 million shares. 
› Refer to “Share information and earnings per share” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report for

At year-end 2023, UBS owned 253,233,437 UBS Group AG shares, which corresponded to 7.31% of the total share 
capital of UBS Group AG. At the same time, UBS had acquisition positions relating to 273,216,729 voting rights of UBS 
Group AG and disposal positions relating to 211,212,648 such rights, corresponding to 7.89% and 6.10% of the total 
voting rights of UBS Group AG, respectively. Of the disposal positions, 196,620,932 related to voting rights on shares 
deliverable in respect of employee awards. The calculation methodology for the acquisition and disposal positions is 
based on the Ordinance of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority on Financial Market Infrastructures and 
Market Conduct in Securities and Derivatives Trading, which states that all future potential share delivery obligations, 
irrespective of the contingent nature of the delivery, must be considered.
Employee share ownership
Employee share ownership is encouraged and made possible in a variety of ways. Our Equity Plus Plan is a voluntary plan 
that provides eligible employees with the opportunity to purchase UBS Group AG shares at market value and receive, at 
no additional cost, one notional UBS Group AG share for every three shares purchased. Additional shares vest after a 
maximum of three years, provided the employee remains employed by UBS and has retained the purchased shares 
throughout the holding period. The Equity Ownership Plan (the EOP) is a mandatory deferral plan for all employees that 
are subject to deferral requirements (regulatory-driven or total compensation greater than USD / CHF 300,000) but do 
not receive LTIP awards. EOP recipients receive a portion of their deferred performance award in notional shares (or 
notional funds for employees in Investment Areas within Asset Management). GEB members and most Managing 
Directors reporting to the GEB and their direct reports at MD level1
 receive the equity-based Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(the LTIP) instead of the EOP. Both the EOP and LTIP include employment conditions and malus conditions that allow the 
firm to reduce or fully forfeit unvested deferred awards under certain circumstances, pursuant to performance and 
harmful acts provisions. In addition, forfeiture is triggered in cases where employment has been terminated for cause. 
Underlining our emphasis on sustainable performance and risk management, and to support delivering on our ambitious 
integration goals and business / financial targets, LTIP awards will only vest if predetermined performance conditions are 
met.
On 31 December 2023, UBS employees held at least 7.4% of UBS shares outstanding (including approximately 5.36% 
in unvested deferred notional shares from our compensation programs). These figures are based on known shareholding 
information from employee participation plans, personal holdings with UBS and selected individual retirement plans. At 
the end of 2023, at least 25.2% of all employees held UBS shares through the firm’s employee share participation plans.

blackout periods. Such UBS employees are not permitted to trade UBS financial instruments in the period starting from 
the close of business in New York on the seventh business day of the final month of the financial quarter of UBS Group 
AG and ending on the day of the publication of the quarterly financial results.

Shares and participation certificates
UBS Group AG has a single class of shares, which are registered shares in the form of uncertificated securities (in the 
sense of the Swiss Code of Obligations). Each registered share has a nominal value of CHF 0.10 and carries one vote, 
subject to the restrictions set out under “Transferability, voting rights and nominee registration” below.
We have no participation certificates outstanding.
UBS Group AG shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange and also on the NYSE as global registered shares. As such, 
they can be traded and transferred across applicable borders, without the need for conversion, with identical shares 
traded on different stock exchanges in different currencies.

Distributions to shareholders
The decision to pay a dividend and the amount of any dividend depend on a variety of factors, including our profits, cash 
flow generation and capital ratios. 
At the 2024 AGM, the BoD is proposing to shareholders for approval a dividend of USD 0.70 per share for the 2023 
financial year. Shareholders whose shares are held through SIX SIS AG will receive dividends in Swiss francs, based on an 
exchange rate published on the day prior to the ex-dividend date. Shareholders holding shares through The Depository 
Trust Company in New York or Computershare will be paid dividends in US dollars. 
In compliance with Swiss tax law, 50% of the dividend will be paid out of retained earnings and the balance will be paid 
out of the capital contribution reserve. Dividends paid out of capital contribution reserves are not subject to Swiss 
withholding tax. The portion of the dividend paid out of retained earnings will be subject to a 35% Swiss withholding 
tax. For US federal income tax purposes, we expect that the dividend will be paid out of current or accumulated earnings 
and profits.
Provided that the proposed dividend distribution out of retained earnings and out of the capital contribution reserve will 
be approved at the AGM on 24 April 2024, the payment of USD 0.70 (or the Swiss franc equivalent) per share will be 
made on 3 May 2024 to holders of shares on the record date 2 May 2024. The shares will be traded ex-dividend as of 
30 April 2024 and, accordingly, the last day on which the shares may be traded with entitlement to receive the dividend 
will be 29 April 2024. 
In January 2023, the BoD announced a new two-year share repurchase program. At the 2023 AGM, the shareholders 
authorized the BoD to repurchase shares for cancellation purposes in an aggregate value of up to USD 6bn until the 
2025 AGM. Any shares repurchased under the program are intended to be canceled by way of capital reduction, which 
will be subject to shareholder approval at one or several subsequent AGMs. In the interim period, the acquisition and 
holding of such shares are not subject to the 10% threshold for UBS Group AG’s own shares within the meaning of Art. 
659 para 2 of the Swiss Code of Obligations.
Annual Report 2023 | Corporate governance and compensation | Corporate governance 191
Looking ahead, the 2022 share repurchase program will be concluded at the end of its two-year term by end of March 
2024, and the repurchased shares are intended to be canceled by means of a capital reduction, pending approval by the 
shareholders at a future AGM. In 2024, we plan to repurchase up to USD 1bn of our shares commencing after the 
completion of the merger of UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG under the new 2023 share repurchase program approved by 
the shareholders at the 2023 AGM. 
› Refer to “UBS shares” in the “Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet” section of this report for more information about 
the share repurchase programs
Transferability, voting rights and nominee registration
We do not apply any restrictions or limitations on the transferability of UBS Group AG shares. Voting rights may be 
exercised without any restrictions by shareholders entered into the UBS share register if they expressly render a declaration 
of beneficial ownership according to the provisions of the AoA.
We have special provisions for the registration of nominees. Nominees are entered in the UBS share register with voting 
rights up to a total of 5% of all issued UBS Group AG shares if they agree to disclose, upon our request, beneficial owners 
holding 0.3% or more of all issued UBS Group AG shares. An exception to the 5% voting limit rule is in place for securities 
clearing organizations, such as The Depository Trust Company in New York. 
› Refer to “Shareholders’ participation rights” in this section for more information
Convertible bonds and options
As of 31 December 2023, there were no conditional capital securities or convertible bonds outstanding requiring the 
issuance of new shares. However, as of the same date, AT1 instruments issued by UBS Group AG in an aggregate principal 
amount of USD 3.5bn were outstanding, and such instruments have terms that provide for an equity conversion feature 
(instead of the existing write-down feature) as soon as UBS Group AG has a minimum amount of conversion capital in 
place. 
› Refer to the “Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet” section of this report for more information about our outstanding 
capital instruments
As of 31 December 2023, there were no employee options or stock appreciation rights outstanding. Option-based 
compensation plans are sourced by issuing new shares out of UBS Group AG’s conditional capital. As of 31 December 
2023, UBS Group AG had USD 12,170,583 in conditional share capital available for the issuance of new shares for this 
purpose.
› Refer to “Conditional share capital” in this section for more information
› Refer to “Note 28 Employee benefits: variable compensation” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report for 
more information about outstanding options and stock appreciation rights
Shareholders’ participation rights
We are committed to shareholder participation in decision-making processes. Our online voting platform offers registered 
shareholders a convenient log-in and online voting process. Registered shareholders are sent personal invitations to the 
general meetings. Together with the invitation materials, they receive a personal one-time password and a QR code to 
easily log into the online voting platform, where they can enter their voting instructions or order an admission card for 
the general meeting. 
Shareholders who choose not to receive the comprehensive invitation materials are informed of upcoming general 
meetings by a short letter containing a personal one-time password, a QR code for online voting and a reference to 
ubs.com/agm, where all information for the upcoming meeting is available.
General meetings offer shareholders the opportunity to raise questions for the BoD, the GEB and internal and external 
auditors. 
Voting rights, restrictions and representation
We place no restrictions on share ownership and voting rights. However, pursuant to general principles formulated by 
the BoD, nominees, which normally represent a large number of individual shareholders and may hold an unlimited 
number of shares, have voting rights limited to a maximum of 5% of all issued UBS Group AG shares if they agree to 
disclose, upon our request, beneficial owners holding 0.3% or more of all issued UBS Group AG shares. This 5% limit 
has been implemented to avoid large shareholders being entered in the UBS share register via nominee companies so as 
to exercise influence without directly registering their shares with UBS. An exception to the 5% voting limit rule is in 
place for securities clearing organizations, such as The Depository Trust Company in New York.
Shareholders can exercise voting rights conferred by shares only if they are registered in our share register with voting 
rights. To register, shareholders must confirm that they have acquired UBS Group AG shares in their own name and for 
their own account. 
Annual Report 2023 | Corporate governance and compensation | Corporate governance 192
All shareholders registered with voting rights are entitled to participate in general meetings. If they do not wish to attend 
in person, they may issue instructions to support, reject or abstain for each individual item on the meeting agenda, either 
by giving instructions to an independent proxy in accordance with article 14 of the AoA or by granting a written power 
of attorney to a third person of their choice (which does not need to be a shareholder) to vote on their behalf. 
Alternatively, registered shareholders may issue their voting instructions to the independent proxy electronically through 
our online voting platform. Nominee companies normally submit the proxy material to the beneficial owners and forward 
the collected votes to the independent proxy.
› Refer to article 14 of the AoA, available at ubs.com/governance, for more information about the issuing of instructions to 
independent voting right representatives 
Statutory quorums
Motions are decided at a general meeting by a majority of the votes represented, excluding blank and invalid ballots. For 
the approval of certain specific issues, the Swiss Code of Obligations requires a positive vote from a two-thirds majority 
of the votes represented at the given general meeting and from a majority of the nominal value of shares represented 
thereat. Such issues include creating shares with privileged voting rights, introducing restrictions on the transferability of 
registered shares, creating conditional capital or introducing a capital band or reserve capital and restricting or excluding 
shareholders’ preemptive rights. 
The AoA also require a two-thirds majority of votes represented for approval of any change to their provisions regarding 
the number of BoD members, any decision to remove one-quarter or more of the BoD members and any modification to 
the provision establishing this qualified quorum.
Votes and elections are generally conducted electronically to ascertain the exact number of votes represented. Voting by 
a show of hands is possible if a clear majority is predictable. Shareholders representing at least 3% of the votes 
represented may request that a vote or election be carried out electronically or by written ballot. To allow shareholders 
to clearly express their views on all individual topics, each agenda item is separately put to a vote and BoD members are 
elected on a person-by-person basis.
Convocation of general meetings of shareholders
The AGM must be held within six months of the close of the financial year (i.e., 31 December). In 2024, the AGM will 
take place on 24 April.
Extraordinary general meetings (EGMs) may be convened whenever the BoD or the auditors consider it necessary. 
Shareholders individually or jointly representing at least 5% of the share capital may at any time, including during an 
AGM, require, by way of a written statement, that an EGM be convened to address a specific issue they put forward.
A personal invitation, including a detailed agenda, is made available to every registered shareholder at least 20 days 
ahead of each scheduled general meeting. The items on the agenda are also published in the Swiss Official Gazette of 
Commerce, as well as at ubs.com/agm.
Placing of items on the agenda
Pursuant to the AoA, shareholders individually or jointly representing shares with an aggregate minimum nominal value 
of USD 62,500 may submit requests for items to be placed on the agenda for consideration at the next general meeting 
of shareholders or for motions relating to agenda items to be included in the notice to convene the general meeting.
In January of each year, the invitation to submit such agenda items or motions relating to agenda items is published in 
the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce and at ubs.com/agm. Requests for motions relating to agenda items and items 
to be placed on the agenda must include the actual motions to be put forward, together with a short explanation. Such 
requests must be submitted to the BoD no later than the deadline published by UBS Group AG, including a statement 
from the depository bank confirming the number of shares held by the requesting shareholder(s) and that these shares 
are blocked from sale until the end of the general meeting of shareholders. The BoD formulates opinions on such requests 
from shareholders, which are published together with the motions from the BoD.
Registrations in the UBS share register
The UBS share register, where around 254,000 UBS Group AG shareholders are directly registered as of 28 March 2024, 
is an internal, non-public register subject to statutory confidentiality, secrecy, privacy and data protection regulations 
protecting registered shareholders. In general, third parties and shareholders have no inspection rights with regard to 
data related to other shareholders. Disclosure of such data is permitted only in specific and limited instances. In line with 
the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, the disclosure of personal data as defined thereunder is only allowed with the 
consent of the registered shareholder and in cases where there is an overriding private or public interest or if explicitly 
provided for by Swiss law. The Swiss Federal Act on Financial Market Infrastructures and Market Conduct in Securities 
and Derivatives Trading contains specific reporting duties, such as in relation to significant shareholders (refer to 
“Significant shareholders” in this section for more information). Disclosure may also be required or requested by a court 
of a competent jurisdiction, by any regulatory body that regulates the conduct of UBS Group AG or by other statutory 
provisions.
Annual Report 2023 | Corporate governance and compensation | Corporate governance 193
The general rules for entry into our Swiss share register with voting rights are described in article 5 of our AoA. The same 
rules apply to our US transfer agent that operates the US share register for all UBS Group AG shares in a custodian 
account in the US, where some 234,000 US shareholders are indirectly registered via nominee companies as of 28 March 
2024. In order to determine the voting rights of each shareholder, our share register generally closes two business days 
prior to a general meeting. Our independent proxy agent processes voting instructions from shareholders as long as 
technically possible, generally also until two business days before a general meeting. Such technical closure of our share 
register facilitates the determination of the actual voting rights of every shareholder that issued a voting instruction. 
Irrespective of this technical closure, shares that are registered in our share register are never immobilized and such 
closure does not affect the tradability of such shares at any time, irrespective of any issued voting instructions.
› Refer to article 5 of our AoA, available at ubs.com/governance, for more information about the general rules for entry into the 
UBS share register
Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors of UBS Group AG (the BoD), led by the Chairman, consists of between 6 and 12 members, as per 
our AoA. 
The BoD decides on the strategy of the Group, upon recommendation by the Group Chief Executive Officer (the Group 
CEO), and is responsible for the overall direction, supervision and control of the Group and its management. It is also 
responsible for supervising compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The BoD exercises oversight over UBS 
Group AG and its subsidiaries, and is responsible for establishing a clear Group governance framework to provide 
effective steering and supervision of the Group, taking into account the material risks to which UBS Group AG and its 
subsidiaries are exposed. The BoD has ultimate responsibility for the success of the Group and for delivering sustainable 
shareholder value within a framework of prudent and effective controls. It approves all financial statements and appoints 
and removes all GEB members. 
Members of the Board of Directors
At the AGM on 5 April 2023, Colm Kelleher, was re-elected as Chairman of the Board and Lukas Gähwiler, Jeremy 
Anderson, Claudia Böckstiegel, William C. Dudley, Patrick Firmenich, Fred Hu, Mark Hughes, Nathalie Rachou, Julie G. 
Richardson, Dieter Wemmer and Jeanette Wong were re-elected as members of the BoD. At that same AGM, Julie G. 
Richardson, Dieter Wemmer and Jeanette Wong were re-elected as members of the Compensation Committee. ADB 
Altorfer Duss & Beilstein AG was re-elected as independent proxy agent. Following their election, the BoD appointed 
Lukas Gähwiler as Vice Chairman and Jeremy Anderson as Senior Independent Director of UBS Group AG. On 12 January 
2024, the BoD announced that Dieter Wemmer would not stand for re-election at the forthcoming AGM, after serving 
on the BoD for eight years, and that Gail Kelly would be nominated for election to the BoD at the same AGM. She served 
as the Group CEO and Managing Director for two banks in Australia, St. George Bank (2002 to 2007) followed by 
Westpac Banking Corporation (2008 to 2015). Gail Kelly acted as Senior Global Advisor for UBS from 2016 to 2023.
Article 31 of our AoA limits the number of mandates that members of the BoD may hold outside UBS Group to four 
mandates in listed companies and five additional mandates in non-listed companies. Mandates in companies that are 
controlled by us or that control us are not subject to this limitation. In addition, members of the BoD may hold no more 
than 10 mandates at UBS’s request and 10 mandates in associations, charitable organizations, foundations, trusts, and 
employee welfare foundations without commercial purpose. As of 31 December 2023, no member of the BoD reached 
any of these thresholds. 
The following biographies provide information about the BoD members who were in office after the 2023 AGM and the 
Group Company Secretary. In addition to information on mandates, the biographies include information on memberships 
or other activities or functions, as required by the SIX Swiss Exchange Corporate Governance Directive.
No member of the BoD currently carries out operational management tasks within the Group. All members of the BoD 
are therefore non-executive members. Except for Lukas Gähwiler, no member of the BoD has carried out operational 
management tasks within the Group over the past three years.
As a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in 2023, to ensure compliance with our governance principles 
and to facilitate a smooth integration into UBS, Lukas Gähwiler was appointed chairman of the board of Credit Suisse 
AG, Jeremy Anderson was appointed vice chairman of that board and Mark Hughes a member of it.

Elections and terms of office
Shareholders annually elect each member of the BoD individually, as well as the Chairman and the members of the 
Compensation Committee, based on proposals from the BoD. 
As set out in the Organization Regulations, BoD members are normally expected to serve for at least three years. BoD 
members are limited to serving for a maximum of 10 consecutive terms of office; in exceptional circumstances, the BoD 
may extend that limit. 
› Refer to “Skills, expertise and training of the Board of Directors” in this section for more information
Organizational principles and structure
Following each AGM, the BoD meets to appoint one or more Vice Chairmen, a Senior Independent Director, the BoD 
committee members (other than the Compensation Committee members, who are elected by the shareholders) and the 
respective committee Chairpersons. At the same meeting, the BoD appoints the Group Company Secretary, who, 
pursuant to the Organization Regulations, acts as secretary to the BoD and its committees.
Pursuant to the AoA and the Organization Regulations, the BoD meets as often as business requires, but it must meet at 
least six times a year. The presence of either the Chairman, one of the Vice Chairmen or the Senior Independent Director, 
as well as the majority of the members of the BoD, is required to pass valid BoD resolutions. In 2023, a majority of 
meetings were held in person. During 2023, a total of 33 BoD meetings were held, 14 of which were attended by GEB 
members. The average participation in the BoD meetings was 99%. In addition to the BoD meetings attended by GEB 
members, the Group CEO regularly attended some of the meetings of the BoD without the participation of other GEB 
members. The meetings had an average duration of 87 minutes. 
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group led to a significant increase in the number of ad hoc calls and meetings. In the 
period leading up to the announcement, to support the BoD’s decision making, and afterwards, to provide oversight for 
the integration of Credit Suisse, 28 extra meetings or calls were held. In the second half of the year, the respective tasks 
were folded back into the standard meeting cycle. In 2023 the BoD held a total of 61 meetings, which lasted for 
approximately 100 hours.
The BoD held a two-day strategy workshop, which focused on the integration of Credit Suisse, included updates from 
each business division and region and focused on the planning for the first 90 days after the legal close of UBS’s 
acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. 
At the BoD meetings, each committee Chairperson provides the BoD with an update on current activities of his or her 
committee and important committee issues. We also continued with the coordination and exchange of information 
between UBS Group AG and its significant group entities. Joint meetings between the BoD of UBS Group AG and the 
boards of directors of the significant group entities, as well as between the respective chairs of the risk and audit 
committees, have been held. As in prior years, an annual workshop for non-executive board members of all significant 
group entities was held and included representatives from the Credit Suisse legal entities.

Performance assessment
In spring 2024, the BoD self-assessment was conducted in-house, with an in-depth questionnaire, and it confirmed that 
the BoD operated efficiently and effectively. Every third year, an external assessment of the effectiveness of the BoD is 
performed. The most recent external review was conducted in 2022 and concluded that the BoD and its committees 
operate effectively, in line with best practices, and meet the highest standards also in comparison with leading 
international peers. The next external review will take place in 2025. 
BoD committees
The committees listed below assist the BoD in fulfilling its responsibilities. These committees and their charters are 
described in our Organization Regulations, available at ubs.com/governance. The committees meet as often as their 
business requires, but no less than four times a year in the case of the Audit Committee, the Risk Committee and the 
Compensation Committee, and no less than twice a year in the case of the Corporate Culture and Responsibility 
Committee (the CCRC) and the Governance and Nominating Committee. Topics of common interest or affecting more 
than one committee are discussed at joint committee meetings. 
During 2023, a total of 10 joint committee meetings were held. The Audit Committee met four times with the Risk 
Committee and three times with the CCRC. The Risk Committee met twice with the CCRC and once with the 
Compensation Committee.
Audit Committee
Throughout 2023, the Audit Committee consisted of the same four independent BoD members. All Audit Committee 
members have accounting or related financial management expertise and, in compliance with the rules established 
pursuant to the 2002 US Sarbanes–Oxley Act, at least one member qualifies as a financial expert. The NYSE standards 
on corporate governance and Rule 10A-3 under the US Securities Exchange Act set more stringent independence 
requirements for members of audit committees than for the other members of the BoD. Throughout 2023, all members 
of the Audit Committee satisfied these requirements, in that they did not receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, 
advisory or compensatory fees from any member of the Group other than in their capacity as a BoD member, did not 
hold, directly or indirectly, UBS Group AG shares in excess of 5% of the outstanding capital and did not serve on the 
audit committees of more than two other public companies.
During 2023, the Audit Committee held 14 committee meetings, with a participation rate of 100%. The meetings had 
an average duration of approximately 120 minutes. Additional attendees included the Group CFO, the Group Controller, 
the Chief Accounting Officer, the Head Group Internal Audit (GIA) and the external auditors. The Chairman of the BoD, 
the Vice Chairman and the Group CEO attended most meetings. The Chairperson and the committee continued to 
maintain regular contact with core supervisory authorities.

The function of the Audit Committee is to support the BoD in fulfilling its oversight duty relating 
to financial reporting and internal controls over financial reporting, the effectiveness of the 
external and internal audit functions, and the effectiveness of whistleblowing procedures.
Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the financial 
statements, while the external auditors are responsible for auditing financial statements. The Audit 
Committee’s responsibility is one of oversight and review.

1 Additionally, the Risk Committee held two ad hoc calls. 2 Lukas Gähwiler became a member of this committee after the 2023 AGM; indicated are his attended and total meetings. 
Ad hoc committees 
The Special Committee and the Strategy Committee are two ad hoc committees, which have a standing composition and 
hold meetings as and when required. 
In 2023, the Special Committee was chaired by Jeremy Anderson, with Colm Kelleher, Lukas Gähwiler, Claudia 
Böckstiegel, Nathalie Rachou and Julie G. Richardson as its members. Its primary purpose is to oversee activities related 
to key litigation and investigation matters, review management’s respective proposals and provide to the BoD 
recommendations for decisions. Additional attendees included the Group CEO and the Group General Counsel. During 
2023, three meetings of the Special Committee were held. 
In 2023, the Strategy Committee was chaired by Colm Kelleher, with William C. Dudley, Fred Hu, Julie Richardson and 
Dieter Wemmer as its members. Lukas Gähwiler became a member of this committee after the 2023 AGM. The primary 
purpose of this committee is to support management and the BoD with regard to the assessment of strategic 
considerations and to prepare decisions on behalf of the BoD. During 2023, two meetings of the Strategy Committee 
were held early in the year in relation to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. The Group CEO and other members 
of the GEB and management participated in these meetings as required. 
Annual Report 2023 | Corporate governance and compensation | Corporate governance 205
Roles and responsibilities of the Chairman of the Board of Directors
At the 2023 AGM, Colm Kelleher was re-elected as the full-time Chairman of the BoD. The Chairman coordinates tasks 
within the BoD, calls BoD meetings and sets the meeting agendas. He presides over all general meetings of shareholders, 
chairs the Governance and Nominating Committee, as well as the CCRC, and works with the committee Chairpersons 
to coordinate the work of all BoD committees. Together with the Group CEO, the Chairman undertakes responsibility 
for UBS’s reputation, and is responsible for effective communication with shareholders and other stakeholders, including 
government officials, regulators and public organizations. This is in addition to establishing and maintaining close working 
relationships with the Group CEO and other GEB members, and providing advice and support when appropriate.
› Refer to “Employees” in the “How we create value for our stakeholders” section of this report for information about our Pillars, 
Principles and Behaviors
In 2023, the Chairman met regularly with core supervisory authorities of all major locations where UBS is active. Meetings 
with important supervisory authorities were scheduled on an ad hoc or needs-driven basis.
Roles and responsibilities of the Vice Chairmen and the Senior Independent Director
The BoD appoints one or more Vice Chairmen and a Senior Independent Director. If the BoD appoints more than one 
Vice Chairman, at least one of them must be independent. Both the Vice Chairman and the Senior Independent Director 
support the Chairman with regard to his responsibilities and authorities and provide him with advice. In conjunction with 
the Chairman and the Governance and Nominating Committee, they facilitate good Group-wide corporate governance, 
as well as balanced leadership and control within the Group, the BoD and the committees.
Lukas Gähwiler was appointed as Vice Chairman following the 2022 AGM. Jeremy Anderson was re-appointed the Senior 
Independent Director and has held that post since 2020. The Vice Chairman is required to lead meetings of the BoD in 
the temporary absence of the Chairman. Together with the Governance and Nominating Committee, either the Senior 
Independent Director or the Vice Chairman is tasked with the ongoing monitoring and the annual evaluation of the 
Chairman. The Vice Chairman also represents UBS on behalf of the Chairman in meetings with internal or external 
stakeholders. In particular, Lukas Gähwiler represents UBS across a broad range of associations and industry bodies in 
Switzerland. 
The Senior Independent Director enables and supports communication and the flow of information among the 
independent BoD members. At least twice a year, he organizes and leads a meeting of the independent BoD members 
without the participation of the Chairman. In 2023, two independent BoD meetings were held with an average 
participation rate of 95% and an average duration of approximately 105 minutes. The Senior Independent Director also 
relays to the Chairman any issues or concerns raised by the independent BoD members and acts as a point of contact for 
shareholders and stakeholders seeking discussions with an independent BoD member.
Important business connections of independent members of the Board of Directors
As a global financial services provider and a major Swiss bank, we enter into business relationships with many large 
companies, including some in which our BoD members have management or independent board responsibilities. The 
Governance and Nominating Committee determines in each instance whether the nature of the Group’s business 
relationship with such a company might compromise our BoD members’ capacity to express independent judgment.
Our Organization Regulations require three-quarters of the BoD members to be independent. For this purpose, 
independence is determined in accordance with FINMA Circular 2017/1 “Corporate governance – banks” and the NYSE 
rules. 
In 2023, our BoD met the standards of the Organization Regulations for the percentage of directors who are considered 
independent under the criteria described above. No current BoD member has either an employment contract or a 
significant business connection to UBS or any of its subsidiaries. No BoD member currently carries out operational 
management tasks within the Group. Except for the Vice Chairman, no BoD member has carried out operational 
management tasks within the Group over the past three years. 
All relationships and transactions with UBS Group AG’s independent BoD members are conducted in the ordinary course 
of business and are on the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated 
persons. All relationships and transactions with BoD members’ associated companies are conducted at arm’s length.

Annual Report 2023 | Corporate governance and compensation | Corporate governance 206
Checks and balances: the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Board
We operate under a strict dual board structure, as mandated by Swiss banking law. The separation of responsibilities 
between the BoD and the GEB is clearly defined in the Organization Regulations. The BoD decides on the strategy of the 
Group, upon recommendations by the Group CEO, and exercises ultimate supervision over management; whereas the 
GEB, headed by the Group CEO, has executive management responsibility. The functions of Chairman and Group CEO 
are assigned to two different people, leading to a separation of powers. This structure establishes checks and balances 
and preserves the institutional independence of the BoD from the executive management of the Group, for which 
responsibility is delegated to the GEB. No member of one board may simultaneously be a member of the other.
Supervision and control of the GEB remain with the BoD. The authorities and responsibilities of the two bodies are 
governed by the AoA and the Organization Regulations.
Skills, expertise and training of the Board of Directors
The BoD is well-diversified and composed of members with a broad spectrum of skills, educational backgrounds, 
experience, and expertise from a range of sectors that reflect the nature and scope of the firm’s business. The Governance 
and Nominating Committee maintains a competencies and experience matrix to identify gaps in the competencies and 
experiences considered most relevant to the BoD, taking into consideration the firm’s business exposure, risk profile, 
strategy and geographic reach. 
In recent years, the composition of the BoD has been systematically shaped along the identified requirements. The 
appointment of a new Chairman and Vice Chairman in 2022, as well as the nomination of Gail Kelly in January 2024, 
were important elements in this continuous process. We maintain and update a list of potential candidates for UBS Group 
AG.
Key competencies
– banking (wealth management, asset management, personal and corporate banking) and insurance
– investment banking, capital markets 
– finance, audit, accounting 
– risk management, compliance and legal 
– human resources management, including compensation
– technology, cybersecurity
– regulatory authority, central bank 
– environmental, social and governance (ESG)
Leadership experience
– experience as a CEO or chairperson
– executive board leadership experience (e.g., as CFO, chief risk officer or COO of a listed company)
The Governance and Nominating Committee reviews these categories and ratings annually to confirm that the BoD 
continues to possess the most relevant experience and competencies to perform its duties.
With regard to the composition of the BoD after the 2023 AGM, the BoD members thereof identified all of the target 
competencies as being their key competencies. Particularly strong levels of experience and expertise existed in these 
areas:
– financial services 
– risk management, compliance and legal 
– finance, audit, accounting
Furthermore, 10 of the 12 BoD members have held or currently hold chairperson, CEO or other executive board-level 
leadership positions.
Moreover, we consider the continuous education of our BoD members to be an important priority and support their 
attendance to various training sessions. In addition to a comprehensive induction program for new BoD members, 
continuous training and topical deep dives are part of the BoD agenda. 
Cybersecurity governance
Cybersecurity as one of the inherently highest and most rapidly evolving non-financial risks is a key focus for the BoD. It 
is primarily covered by the Risk Committee through a combination of (i) regular reporting as part of the monthly risk 
reports and quarterly technology risk updates, and (ii) dedicated deep-dives on specific cybersecurity topics, including 
summaries and assessments of actual cybersecurity incidents in the industry, assessments of the firm’s security posture 
and related continuous improvement measures. In addition, the BoD members receive periodic updates from the Group 
Chief Information Security Office on key cybersecurity threats and incidents across the globe and industries, and the Risk 
Committee regularly organizes education and training sessions, including cyber exercises, for all BoD members.

governance framework

Annual Report 2023 | Corporate governance and compensation | Corporate governance 207
Succession planning 
Succession planning is one of the key responsibilities of both the BoD and the GEB. Across all divisions and regions, an 
inclusive talent development and succession planning process is in place that aims to foster the personal development 
and Group-wide mobility of our employees. Although the recruiting process for BoD and GEB members takes into account 
a broad spectrum of factors, such as skills, backgrounds, experience and expertise, our approach with regard to diversity 
considerations does not constitute a diversity policy within the meaning of the EU Directive on Non-Financial Reporting, 
and Swiss law does not require UBS to maintain such a policy.
In 2022, the GEB launched several strategic initiatives with the close involvement of the BoD and with the aim of further 
strengthening internal succession planning at UBS. This included the early identification of talents and their systematic 
development, including international and cross-divisional rotations. The succession plans for the GEB and the 
management layers below it are managed under the lead of the Group CEO and are reviewed and approved by the BoD. 
Moreover in 2023, to cater to the challenges posed by the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, the composition of the 
GEB was complemented with new members. 
For the BoD, the Chairman leads a systematic succession planning process as illustrated in the chart below. Our strategy 
and the business environment constitute the main drivers in our succession planning process for new BoD members, as 
they define the key competencies required on the BoD. Taking the diversity and the tenure of the existing BoD into 
account, the Governance and Nominating Committee defines the recruiting profile for the search. Both external and 
internal sources contribute to identifying suitable candidates. The Chairman and the members of the Governance and 
Nominating Committee meet with potential candidates and, with the support of the full BoD, nominations are submitted 
to the AGM for approval. New BoD members follow an in-depth onboarding process designed to enable them to 
integrate efficiently and become effective in their new role. Due to this succession planning process, the composition of 
the BoD is in line with the demanding requirements of a leading global financial services firm. 
The smooth and effective succession at the GEB level and the appointments of internal talent as new GEB members 
demonstrates the strength of the succession planning at UBS. The BoD and the GEB remain committed to the continuous 
focus on developing a high-quality bench of succession candidates at all levels in the organization.
Annual Report 2023 | Corporate governance and compensation | Corporate governance 208
Information and control instruments with regard to the Group Executive Board
The BoD is kept informed of the GEB’s activities in various ways, including regular meetings between the Chairman, the 
Group CEO and GEB members. The Group CEO and other GEB members also participate in BoD meetings to update its 
members on all significant issues. The BoD receives regular comprehensive reports covering financial, capital, funding, 
liquidity, regulatory, compliance and legal developments, as well as performance against plan and forecasts for the 
remainder of the year. For important developments, BoD members are also updated by the GEB in between meetings. In 
addition, the Chairman receives the meeting material and minutes of the GEB meetings.
BoD members may request from other BoD or GEB members any information about matters concerning the Group that 
they require in order to fulfill their duties. When these requests are raised outside BoD meetings, such requests must go 
through the Group Company Secretary and be addressed to the Chairman. 
The BoD is supported in discharging its governance responsibilities by GIA, which independently assesses whether risk 
management, control and governance processes are designed and operating sustainably and effectively.
The Head GIA reports directly to the Chairman. In addition, GIA has a functional reporting line to the Audit Committee 
in accordance with its responsibilities as set forth in our Organization Regulations. The Audit Committee assesses the 
independence and performance of GIA and the effectiveness of both the Head GIA and GIA as an organization, approves 
GIA’s annual audit plan and objectives and monitors GIA’s discharge of these objectives. The committee is also in regular 
contact with the Head GIA. 
GIA issues quarterly reports that provide an overview of significant audit results and key issues, as well as themes and 
trends, based on results of individual audits, continuous risk assessment and issue assurance. The reports are provided to 
the Chairman, the members of the Audit and the Risk Committees, the GEB and other stakeholders. The Head GIA 
regularly updates the Chairman and the Audit Committee on GIA’s activities, processes, audit plan execution, resourcing 
requirements and other important developments. GIA issues an annual Activity Report, which is provided to the Chairman 
and the Audit Committee to support their assessment of GIA’s effectiveness.

Group Executive Board
The BoD delegates the management of the business to the Group Executive Board (the GEB). 
Responsibilities, authorities and organizational principles of the Group Executive Board
As of 31 December 2023, the GEB, under the leadership of the Group CEO, consisted of 16 members. It has executive 
management responsibility for the steering of the Group and its business, develops the strategies of the Group, business 
divisions and Group functions, and implements the BoD-approved strategies. The GEB is also the risk council of the 
Group, with overall responsibility for establishing and supervising the implementation of risk management and control 
principles, as well as for managing the risk profile of the Group, as determined by the BoD and the Risk Committee. 
In 2023, the GEB held a total of 57 meetings. 
› Refer to the Organization Regulations of UBS Group AG, available at ubs.com/governance, for more information about the 
authorities of the Group Executive Board
Changes to the Group Executive Board
On 29 March 2023, the BoD named Sergio P. Ermotti as its new Group CEO, effective 5 April 2023. The BoD made the 
decision in light of UBS’s new priorities following its planned acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Sergio P. Ermotti 
had been the Group CEO from 2011 to 2020. Ralph Hamers, who had succeeded Sergio P. Ermotti in 2020, agreed to 
step down and remained at UBS during a transition period to ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth 
handover. At the time of his re-appointment as Group CEO, Sergio P. Ermotti was Chairman of Swiss Re and remained 
in that post until his resignation therefrom on 30 April 2023 to facilitate an orderly transition at Swiss Re.
On 24 April 2023, UBS announced that Christian Bluhm had agreed to remain in his role as Group Chief Risk Officer and 
member of the GEB for the foreseeable future, considering the planned acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, therefore 
delaying the handover to Damian Vogel that was originally planned for 1 May 2023. 
On 9 May 2023, UBS Group AG announced a new operating model and changes to the GEB: CEO of Credit Suisse Group 
AG, Ulrich Körner, would join the GEB and Todd Tuckner would succeed Sarah Youngwood as Group CFO; both 
appointments came into effect at the close of the transaction on 12 June 2023. With immediate effect on 9 May 2023, 
Beatriz Martin Jimenez was named Head Non-core and Legacy and President UBS Europe, Middle East and Africa, 
Michelle Bereaux was named Group Integration Officer, and Stefan Seiler was appointed Head Group Human Resources 
& Group Corporate Services. 
On 24 January 2024, UBS announced that Suni Harford would step down, and Aleksandar Ivanovic was appointed 
President Asset Management effective 1 March 2024. It was also announced that Beatriz Martin Jimenez would take on 
the responsibility as GEB Lead for Sustainability and Impact from Suni Harford, effective 1 March 2024. 
As a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in 2023, and to ensure compliance with our governance principles 
and to facilitate a smooth integration into UBS, in June 2023, Michelle Bereaux and Stefan Seiler were elected as members 
of the board of Credit Suisse AG.
The biographies below provide information about the GEB members in office as of 31 December 2023. The biographies 
of Ralph Hamers and Sarah Youngwood can be found on pages 187 and 192 of the UBS Group AG Annual Report 2022, 
available under “Annual reporting” at ubs.com/investors. In addition to information on mandates, the biographies 
include memberships and other activities or functions, as required by the SIX Swiss Exchange Corporate Governance 
Directive.
In line with Swiss law, article 36 of our AoA limits the number of mandates that GEB members may hold outside UBS 
Group to one mandate in a listed company and five additional mandates in non-listed companies. Mandates in companies 
that are controlled by UBS or that control UBS are not subject to this limitation. In addition, GEB members may not hold 
more than 10 mandates at one time at the request of the company and more than eight mandates in associations, 
charitable organizations, foundations, trusts and employee welfare foundations without commercial purpose. On 
31 December 2023, no member of the GEB reached the aforementioned thresholds.
Responsibilities and authorities of the Asset and Liability Committee
The Asset and Liability Committee of UBS Group AG (the GALCO) is responsible for managing assets and liabilities in line 
with the strategy, risk appetite, regulatory commitments and the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders. The 
GALCO proposes the framework for capital management, capital allocation, and liquidity and funding risk, and proposes 
limits and indicators for the Group to the BoD for approval. It oversees the balance sheet management of the Group, its 
business divisions and Group functions. In 2023, the GALCO held 10 meetings.
Management contracts
We have not entered into management contracts with any companies or natural persons that do not belong to the 
Group.

Change of control and defense measures
Our Articles of Association (the AoA) do not provide any measures for delaying, deferring or preventing a change of 
control. 
Duty to make an offer
Pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Financial Market Infrastructures and Market Conduct in Securities and Derivatives 
Trading of 19 June 2015, anyone who has acquired (whether directly, indirectly or in concert with third parties) more 
than 331
⁄3% of all voting rights of a company listed in Switzerland, whether such rights are exercisable or not, is 
required to submit a takeover offer for all listed shares outstanding. We have not elected to change or opt out of 
this rule.
Clauses on change of control
Neither the terms regulating the BoD members’ mandate nor any employment contracts with GEB members or employees 
holding key functions within the Group contain change of control clauses.
All employment contracts with GEB members stipulate a notice period of six months. During the notice period, GEB 
members are entitled to their salaries and the continuation of existing employment benefits and may be eligible to be 
considered for a discretionary performance award based on their contribution during their tenure.
In case of a change of control, we may, at our discretion, accelerate the vesting of and / or relax applicable forfeiture 
provisions of employees’ awards.

Auditors 
Audit is an integral part of corporate governance. While safeguarding their independence, the external auditors closely 
coordinate their work with Group Internal Audit (GIA). The Audit Committee and, ultimately, the BoD supervises the 
effectiveness of audit work.
› Refer to “Board of Directors” in this section for more information about the Audit Committee
External independent auditors
The 2023 Annual General Meeting (the AGM) re-elected Ernst & Young Ltd (EY) as auditors for the Group for the 2023 
financial year. The audit of the Group encompasses the consolidated results of Credit Suisse AG and its subsidiaries from 
the date of its acquisition on 12 June 2023. EY assumes virtually all auditing functions according to laws, regulatory 
requests and the AoA. Robert Jacob is the EY partner in charge of the overall coordination of the UBS Group financial 
and regulatory audits and the co-signing partner of the financial audit. In 2020, Maurice McCormick became the lead 
audit partner for the financial statement audit and has an incumbency limit of five years. In 2021, Hannes Smit became 
the Lead Auditor to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) with an incumbency limit of seven years. 
Daniel Martin has been the co-signing partner for the FINMA audit since 2019, with an incumbency limit of seven years. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers AG served as auditors for Credit Suisse entities for the 2023 financial year. Following the 
election of auditors at the 2024 AGM, UBS Group intends to cause EY to be appointed as the auditors of Credit Suisse 
AG and its subsidiaries for the 2024 financial year.
During 2023, the Audit Committee held 14 meetings with the external auditors.
Review of UBS Group AG audit engagement 
Mazars has been appointed as auditors of UBS Europe SE, an indirect subsidiary of UBS Group AG, as EU rules require to 
rotate its external auditors in the 2024 financial year. In connection with this required change, and in consideration of 
governance best practices, the BoD considered whether it would propose to shareholders a rotation of the Group auditor 
concurrent with the change at UBS Europe SE. Under the direction of the Audit Committee, UBS conducted a formal 
review of the Group audit engagement including soliciting proposals from potential auditors. In early 2022, based on the 
results of this assessment, the BoD decided to retain EY as the Group’s external auditors.
Audit effectiveness assessment
The Audit Committee assesses the performance, effectiveness and independence of the external auditors on an annual 
basis. The assessment is generally based on interviews with senior management and survey feedback from stakeholders 
across the Group. Assessment criteria include quality of service delivery, quality and competence of the audit team, value 
added as part of the audit, insightfulness, and the overall relationship with EY. Based on its own analysis and the 
assessment results, including feedback received as part of the review of the Group audit engagement described above, 
the Audit Committee concluded that EY’s audit has been effective.

Special auditors for potential capital increases
At the AGM on 8 April 2021, BDO AG was reappointed as special auditors for a three-year term of office. Special auditors 
provide audit opinions in connection with potential capital increases independently from other auditors.
Services performed and fees
The Audit Committee oversees all services provided to UBS by the external auditors. For services requiring the approval 
from the Audit Committee, a preapproval may be granted either for a specific mandate or in the form of a blanket 
preapproval authorizing a limited and well-defined type and scope of services. The fees (including expenses) paid to EY 
are set forth in the table above. In addition, EY received USD 31m in 2023 (USD 35m in 2022) for services performed on 
behalf of our investment funds, many of which have independent fund boards or trustees.
Audit work includes all services necessary to perform the audit for the Group in accordance with applicable laws and 
generally accepted auditing standards, as well as other assurance services that conventionally only the auditor can 
provide. These include statutory and regulatory audits, attestation services and the review of documents to be filed with 
regulatory bodies. The additional services classified as audit in 2023 included several engagements for which EY was 
mandated at the request of FINMA.
Audit-related work consists of assurance and related services traditionally performed by auditors, such as attestation 
services related to financial reporting, internal control reviews and performance standard reviews, as well as consultation 
concerning financial accounting and reporting standards.
Tax work involves services performed by professional staff in EY’s tax division and includes tax compliance and tax 
consultation with respect to our own affairs.
“Other” services are permitted services, which include technical IT security control reviews and assessments.
Group Internal Audit
GIA performs the internal auditing role for the Group. It is an independent function that provides expertise and insights 
to confirm controls are functioning correctly and highlight where UBS needs to better manage current and emerging 
risks. In 2023, after the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, GIA operated with an average headcount of 1,009 fulltime equivalent employees, including Credit Suisse employees.
Annual Report 2023 | Corporate governance and compensation | Corporate governance 220
GIA supports the BoD in discharging its governance responsibilities by taking a dynamic approach to audit, issue assurance 
and risk assessment, drawing attention to key risks in order to drive action to prevent unexpected loss or damage to the 
firm’s reputation. To support the achievement of UBS’s objectives, GIA independently, objectively and systematically 
assesses the:
(i) soundness of the Group’s risk and control culture; 
(ii) reliability and integrity of financial and operational information, including whether activities are properly, accurately 
and completely recorded, and the quality of underlying data and models; and
(iii) design, operating effectiveness and sustainability of:
– processes to define strategy and risk appetite, as well as the overall adherence to the approved strategy;
– governance processes; 
– risk management, including whether risks are appropriately identified and managed; 
– internal controls, specifically whether they are commensurate with the risks taken;
– remediation activities; and
– processes to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, internal policies, and the Group’s constitutional 
documents and contracts.
Audit reports that include significant issues are provided to the Group CEO, relevant GEB members and other responsible 
management. The Chairman, the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the BoD are regularly informed of such 
issues. 
In addition, GIA provides independent assurance on the effective and sustainable remediation of control deficiencies 
within its mandate, taking a prudent and conservative risk-based approach and assessing at the issue level whether the 
root cause and the potential exposure for the firm have been holistically and sustainably addressed. GIA also cooperates 
closely with risk control functions and internal and external legal advisors on investigations into major control issues.
To ensure GIA’s independence from management, the Head GIA reports to the Chairman of the BoD and to the Audit 
Committee, which assesses annually whether GIA has sufficient resources to perform its function, as well as its

Financial disclosure principles 
We fully support transparency and consistent and informative disclosure. We aim to communicate our strategy and results 
in a manner that enables stakeholders to gain a good understanding of how our Group operates, what our growth 
prospects are, and the risks that our businesses and our strategy entail. We assess feedback from analysts and investors 
on a regular basis and, where appropriate, reflect this in our disclosures. To continue achieving these goals, we apply the 
following principles in our financial reporting and disclosure:
– transparency that enhances the understanding of economic drivers and builds trust and credibility;
– consistency within each reporting period and between reporting periods;
– simplicity that allows readers to gain a good understanding of the performance of our businesses;
– relevance, by focusing not only on what is required by regulation or statute but also on what is relevant to our 
stakeholders; and 
– best practice that leads to improved standards.
We regard the continuous improvement of our disclosures as an ongoing commitment.
Financial reporting policies
We report our Group’s results for each financial quarter, including a breakdown of results by business division and 
disclosures or key developments relating to risk management and control, capital, liquidity and funding management. 
Each quarter, we publish quarterly financial reports for UBS Group AG, on the same day as the earnings releases.
The consolidated financial statements of UBS Group AG and UBS AG are prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. 
› Refer to “Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report for 
more information about the basis of accounting
We are committed to maintaining the transparency of our reported results and allowing analysts and investors to make 
meaningful comparisons with prior periods. If there is a major reorganization of our business divisions or if changes to 
accounting standards or interpretations lead to a material change in the Group’s reported results, our results are restated 
for previous periods as required by applicable accounting standards. These restatements show how our results would 
have been reported on the new basis and provide clear explanations of all relevant changes.
US disclosure requirements
As a foreign private issuer, we must file reports and other information, including certain financial reports, with the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) under the US federal securities laws. 
An evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a–15e) under the US 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 has been carried out, under the supervision of management, including the Group CEO, 
the Group CFO and the Group Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Based on that evaluation, the Group CEO and 
the Group CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of 31 December 2023. No 
significant changes have been made to our internal controls or to other factors that could significantly affect these 
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation. Management has excluded Credit Suisse, which UBS acquired in 
2023, from the scope of its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, as permitted by SEC guidance for 
acquired businesses.

Julie G. Richardson
Chairperson of the
Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors
Dear Shareholders,
The Board of Directors (the BoD) and I wish to thank you for your support once again at last year’s Annual General 
Meeting (the AGM) and for sharing your views on our compensation practices over the past year.
Throughout 2023, the BoD Compensation Committee continued to oversee the compensation process, aiming to ensure 
that reward reflects performance, risk-taking is appropriate and employees’ interests are aligned with those of our 
stakeholders. As the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee, I am pleased to present our Compensation Report 
for 2023.
A cornerstone year in terms of integrating Credit Suisse while achieving underlying profitability
2023 was one of the most defining years in the firm’s long history with the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Our 
accomplishments and achievements in 2023 were extensive. Our strategy, focused on delivering outstanding client 
services, sustainable profitability, financial strength and sound risk management, supported the successful navigation 
through a period of significant change and uncertainty. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group further expands our 
market leading client franchise and creates significant value for our shareholders.
– We were called on to acquire the Credit Suisse Group and have subsequently stabilized their client franchise, risk 
management and operations. We have further grown our combined franchise through new client acquisition and 
share-of-wallet gains, as well as the continued success of our client retention and client win-back strategy. Clients 
have entrusted us with USD 77bn of net new assets since the closing of the acquisition and have relied on our advice 
in a challenging geopolitical environment. We have made significant progress with the integration, strengthening our 
position as a leading global wealth manager, including completing the acquisition within three months, making key 
management appointments and taking steps toward an integrated and unified bank.
– While focused on the intense work of integrating Credit Suisse, we achieved underlying profitability at Group level 
despite the challenging macroeconomic environment marked by global concerns about interest rates and economic 
growth. We stayed close to our clients, helping them to navigate uncertainties and maintaining their trust in our 
products and offerings.
– We have formulated our strategy and integration goals for the next three years and indicated what an even stronger 
UBS can sustainably deliver in the long term. While there is much to be done, we have set out the course to successfully 
deliver on our integration plans and have assembled the resources and talent to make that happen.
We are optimistic about our future as we build an even stronger version of the UBS that was called upon to stabilize the 
Swiss financial system in March 2023 and one that all of our key stakeholders can be proud of.
› Refer to the “Acquisition and integration of Credit Suisse” section of this report for further details about our integration efforts
Executing an integrated one firm approach to performance, promotion and compensation 
– We executed an integrated year-end process with all employees subject to one unified system leveraging the longstanding UBS approach to performance, promotion and compensation. This is a significant milestone for our 
combined firm, and is aimed at accelerating our cultural journey.
– In terms of aligning the cultures of the two firms, our performance management approach – with its focus on 
impact and outcomes, consideration of both objectives and behaviors (reflecting both the what and the how), 
emphasis on sustainable high performance, and the resulting link to compensation decisions – is paramount to 
employees understanding what matters most and working together to deliver the firm’s strategic and integration 
objectives.
– In line with our existing commitment to fair pay and diversity, equity and inclusion, we took great care to support 
fairness and equity across the organization, with a focus on like-for-like outcomes for comparable roles and 
performance across the Group.
– In light of the ongoing integration of Credit Suisse, we also considered the complexity of the transaction, as well 
as the need to retain key talent, support pay fairness across the entire organization and stabilize the franchise 
during the integration period via our compensation decisions. While many of the synergies of the transaction relate 
to rightsizing the overall headcount of the company, the upside potential of the transaction will not be realized if 
we cannot also retain the right talent throughout the organization during the transition and thereafter.

Key acquisition-related accomplishments
In 2023, we made tremendous progress with the integration of Credit Suisse. Following the announcement of the 
acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, we focused on stabilizing the client franchise, managing risks and bringing 
operational stability to Credit Suisse. Key accomplishments include the following.
– Closing the transaction in three months.
– Delivering an early repayment of the Public Liquidity Backstop and Emergency Liquidity Assistance Plus and returning 
the Loss Protection Agreement.
– Achieving around USD 4bn in exit rate gross cost savings (compared with full year 2022 for combined UBS and Credit 
Suisse), as we restructured our operations and continued to optimize our cost base by leveraging synergies between 
the combined entities.
– Accelerating the wind-down of Non-core and Legacy by reducing risk-weighted assets by USD 12bn since finalizing its 
perimeter in the second quarter of 2023, releasing over USD 1.5bn of common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital.
– Re-composing and augmenting the Group Executive Board (the GEB) to successfully support the integration.
Financial Performance
Our performance in 2023 reflected the costs from the integration of Credit Suisse, the challenging operating conditions 
for the financial industry, and the uncertainty and market volatility resulting from continued geopolitical tensions. On a 
consolidated basis, reported profit before tax was USD 28,739m, including USD 27,748m of negative goodwill related 
to the acquisition, as well as integration-related expenses of USD 4,478m, and negative goodwill related pull to par 
accretion and other purchase price allocation effects. On an underlying basis, pre-tax profit for the combined businesses 
was USD 3,963m.

division performance
Advisory vote | Corporate governance and compensation | Compensation 225
Commitment to return capital to shareholders
Capital strength is a key pillar of our strategy, and we remain committed to maintaining a balance sheet for all seasons. 
The year-end CET1 capital ratio was 14.4%, and the CET1 leverage ratio was 4.6%, both in excess of our guidance of 
~14% and >4.0%, respectively. For 2023, the Board of Directors plans to propose a dividend to UBS Group AG 
shareholders of USD 0.70 per share. We remain committed to progressive dividends and are accruing for a mid-teen 
percentage increase in the dividend per share for the 2024 financial year.
In 2023, we bought back USD 1.3bn of shares before we announced the acquisition, at which point we paused our share 
repurchases. In 2024, we expect to repurchase up to USD 1bn of shares, commencing after the merger of the UBS AG 
and Credit Suisse AG legal entities, which is expected before the end of the second quarter of the year. Our ambition is 
for share repurchases to exceed our pre-acquisition levels by 2026.
2023 Group performance award pool
Over the past years, our performance award pool has consistently reflected our pay-for-performance philosophy and our 
disciplined approach in managing compensation over business cycles and in alignment to shareholder interests. 
Accordingly, we carefully assessed the financial results and excluded both the positive and negative one-time financial 
impacts of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. 
The table below provides more information on the key factors we considered for the UBS sub-group and the Credit Suisse 
sub-group when determining the performance award pool. Overall, it was important to balance like-for-like pay 
outcomes for comparable roles and performance to support the long-term value creation of the integrated franchise.
2023 Group performance award pool development
UBS sub-group – Reflects our usual pay-for-performance approach beginning with the financial results for the UBS sub-group.
– In addition to financial business performance, we regularly consider individual business-related measures, risk and remediation 
activities as well as competitive market considerations.
Credit Suisse 
sub-group
– Given the extraordinary circumstances, we were not able to apply our usual process to determine the Credit Suisse pool. We 
considered other factors, such as the need to retain key talent to support realization of the value of our investment, support pay 
fairness across the entire organization and stabilize the franchise during the integration period.
– We also considered that 2022 compensation for the Credit Suisse Group reflected a significantly reduced variable compensation 
pool compared with 2021 awards including other variable compensation.
We further balanced our performance award pool decisions with specific retention awards delivered in both deferred 
cash and deferred equity. As in most merger situations, these retention awards were a necessary step to support the 
protection of the client franchise, risk management and operational stability. Furthermore, to support our client win-back 
strategy and promote client growth, we also introduced a client-acquisition and retention award for certain producers, 
which is fully deferred and the final value is linked to the retention of client assets. Retention efforts were targeted and 
limited to certain client roles and critical roles necessary to support operational stability. Overall, the amounts of 
USD 736m are modest by industry standards for an integration of this magnitude. These awards account for 3% of our 
total personnel expenses recognized in 2023.
The UBS compensation framework and approach provides competitive pay for performance, further supporting 
operational stability going forward. Our decisions continue to reflect our diligent approach to considering a balanced 
allocation of profit between shareholders and employees over the cycle, as well as supporting strong capital returns, 
including reflecting the appropriate risk awareness in our business decisions.
Based on the factors above, the 2023 group performance award pool was USD 4.5bn, a reduction of 14% compared 
with the pro forma aggregate 2022 pool of USD 5.3bn for the combined entities (which includes the UBS performance 
award pool, the Credit Suisse variable incentive compensation pool and other variable compensation awards related to 
the 2022 performance year). 
The GEB pool overall increased by 34% to CHF 108m, which reflected the changes in GEB composition to support the 
merger, including the addition of four GEB members. The GEB per capita performance award decreased by 6% compared 
with the previous year.
Separately, we are also grateful for certain members of the BoD who took on additional board roles in significant 
subsidiary entities. These nominations were critical to providing strong governance and oversight of the newly acquired 
subsidiaries, particularly prior to the merger of these legal entities with their UBS counterparts. This approach ensures 
parent company board representation that otherwise would not have existed and promotes governance in line with UBS 
Group AG’s governance principles.

Continuity of our overall compensation framework
Following a comprehensive annual review, we confirmed that our Total Reward Principles and overall compensation 
framework continue to be aligned with our purpose and remain relevant to the Group’s commitment to delivering longterm shareholder value. It is imperative that our pay approach equally recognizes and supports the economic and cultural 
integration of Credit Suisse to create long-term value for the combined firm.
Overall, the compensation framework for all employees, including the GEB, remains broadly unchanged. With respect to 
the equity component of our deferred compensation plan, we have historically granted the GEB equity with performance 
conditions and a payout that varies depending on the performance of the company (the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)), 
while other employees have received shares with time vest requirements only (the Equity Ownership Plan (EOP)). During 
the integration period, we have expanded the group that will receive LTIP (in replacement of EOP) to include Managing 
Directors (MDs) reporting to the GEB and their direct reports at MD level. This will further align the long-term focus of a 
broader group of senior leaders with shareholders while supporting appropriate risk taking and awareness.
Going forward, we will continue to monitor market practice and regulatory developments and, as part of our annual 
review, make any modifications required to ensure our Total Reward Principles and compensation framework remain 
aligned with the interests of our shareholders.
The 2024 Annual General Meeting
At the 2024 AGM on 24 April, we will seek your support on the following compensation-related items:
– the maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the BoD for the period from the 2024 AGM to the 2025 AGM;
– the retroactive incremental amount of compensation for the BoD for the period from the 2023 AGM to 2024 AGM
– the maximum aggregate amount of fixed compensation for the GEB for 2025;
– the aggregate amount of variable compensation for the GEB for 2023; and 
– shareholder endorsement in an advisory vote for this Compensation Report.
On behalf of the Compensation Committee and the BoD, I thank you again for your feedback and we respectfully ask 
for your continued support at the upcoming AGM.

2023 key compensation themes
The feedback that we seek from our shareholders about compensation-related topics is very important to us, as we are 
committed to maintaining a strong link between the interests of our employees and those of our shareholders. We 
continued engaging with shareholders during 2023 and received overall positive feedback about our 
compensation framework. The below summarizes key compensation themes for 2023 and provides answers to the 
questions we most frequently receive from shareholders.
Summary of 2023 key compensation themes / responses to frequently asked questions 
How did the failure of the Credit Suisse Group impact deferred compensation of Credit Suisse Group 
employees?
On 19 March 2023, we announced the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Until that date, the value of the 
outstanding deferred compensation of Credit Suisse Group employees had already been negatively impacted by the 
significant decline in the price of Credit Suisse Group shares.
Furthermore, on 23 May 2023, the Federal Department of Finance (the FDF) issued an order canceling or reducing the 
outstanding unvested variable remuneration for the top levels of management of the Credit Suisse Group. In addition, 
the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) ordered the cancellation of outstanding contingent capital 
awards (CCA) in line with the write-down of Credit Suisse additional tier 1 (AT1) debt.
The following charts provide an overview of the total change in the value of Credit Suisse deferred compensation awards 
in accordance with share price movements and the FDF- and FINMA-canceled amounts. 
– Approximately CHF 2.8bn (a decrease of 75% compared with the initial grant value) of deferred compensation was 
lost by Credit Suisse Group employees. After the cancellations, CHF 947m remained outstanding, including awards 
that continued to be at risk, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, and subject to malus or clawback 
provisions.
– Of the CHF 2.8bn mentioned above, approximately CHF 1.4bn (a decrease of 94% compared with the initial grant 
value) of deferred compensation was lost by Credit Suisse Group employees impacted by the FDF- and FINMA-related 
cancellations, leaving a remaining value of CHF 87m (including awards that continued to be at risk as described above).
Overall, these reductions of CHF 2.8bn in the value of deferred compensation demonstrate the impact of negative 
business developments, risk events and share price movements.
Advisory vote | Corporate governance and compensation | Compensation 228
What is the impact of the Federal Department of Finance order on UBS?
On 11 August 2023, UBS voluntarily terminated the CHF 9bn loss protection agreement (the LPA) and the public liquidity 
backstop (the PLB) with the Swiss National Bank of up to CHF 100bn, guaranteed by the Swiss government. After 
reviewing all assets covered by the LPA since the closing of the transaction involving the acquisition of the Credit Suisse 
Group in June 2023 and taking the appropriate fair value adjustments, UBS concluded that the LPA was no longer 
required. 
All loans under the PLB were fully repaid by the Credit Suisse Group as of the end of May 2023 and Credit Suisse AG 
fully repaid outstanding Emergency Liquidity Assistance Plus loans on 10 August 2023.
Due to the termination of the LPA and release of the guarantee, the implementation of the UBS-related FDF order was 
no longer required. Nevertheless, our analysis had confirmed that the key aspects related to the remuneration system 
requirements under the FDF order were already embedded in our Total Reward Principles and compensation framework. 
This relates in particular to consideration of both financial and non-financial performance, including risk considerations.
Why is UBS seeking retroactive approval for an incremental Board of Directors compensation amount of 
CHF 2.2m?
As a result of the integration of Credit Suisse, in 2023 we expanded the roles of certain members of the Board of Directors 
of UBS Group AG (the BoD) to take on additional responsibilities in the boards of directors of significant subsidiary 
entities. These nominations were and remain critical to providing strong governance and oversight of the subsidiaries, in 
a manner consistent and in compliance with UBS Group AG’s governance principles, as well as to facilitating the 
integration of Credit Suisse entities into UBS. As the integration progresses, we will continue to review the composition 
of the boards of directors of significant entities. Without these appointments, UBS would not have had parent company 
board representation on these significant subsidiary entities and would have had difficulty maintaining legally required 
independent roles across all entities.
– Lukas Gähwiler was appointed as chairman of Credit Suisse AG.
– Jeremy Anderson was nominated as vice chairman of Credit Suisse AG and chair of the audit committee of Credit 
Suisse AG and, in addition, appointed as a member of the board of directors of Credit Suisse International (UK).
– Mark Hughes was appointed as a member of the board of directors of Credit Suisse AG, a member of the risk 
committee of Credit Suisse AG and, effective 1 December 2023, chair of the risk committee of that board. In addition, 
Mr. Hughes was appointed as a member of the board of directors of UBS Americas Holding LLC.
Considering the significant increase in the scope, responsibility and complexity of their mandate, these three BoD 
members will be entitled to receive additional board fees aligned with other non-executive directors on the respective 
subsidiary entity boards. 
Neither the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group nor the appointments to subsidiary board roles were anticipated when 
the maximum amount for BoD fees of CHF 13m was submitted at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (the AGM). As a 
result, while the spend for the BoD of UBS Group AG is within the approved amount, at the 2024 AGM we will request 
that the shareholders approve a retroactive incremental amount of CHF 2.2m for the period from the 2023 AGM to the 
2024 AGM to support the additional subsidiary board fees amount that exceeds the original approval at the 2023 AGM. 
The payment of these subsidiary board fees is therefore subject to shareholder approval.
As a reminder, shareholders of UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG had approved at their respective 2023 AGM 
an aggregate amount for board of director compensation of combined total CHF 26m. The estimated total BoD spend 
in the period from the 2023 AGM to the 2024 AGM is CHF 18.1m, of which CHF 15.2m for the Board of Directors of 
UBS Group AG (as shown in the chart below) and the remaining amount for the board of directors of Credit Suisse Group 
AG (pre-merger close) and Credit Suisse AG (post-merger close). As a result, the overall BoD spend is CHF 7.9m lower 
compared with the combined approved aggregate amount.
Advisory vote | Corporate governance and compensation | Compensation 229
How did UBS adjust reported financial results to calculate the Group and GEB performance award pools as 
well as the LTIP 2020/21 valuation?
The Compensation Committee determined to use UBS sub-group results as the starting point but made adjustments to 
exclude both the positive and negative one-time financial impacts of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. The specific 
adjustments include the impact of gains on the transaction, which means the negative goodwill, or gain, of USD 27.7bn 
had no impact on the Group and GEB performance award pools or the 2020 LTIP achievement level. Other adjustments 
relate to factors such as integration- and acquisition-related costs, increased CET1 capital requirements, and the exclusion 
of certain unplanned one-off items that would otherwise not have occurred, including higher litigation costs. These 
cumulative negative adjustments from reported results reflect the rigorous internal review as well as the judgment of the 
Compensation Committee. We have applied these adjustments in our considerations of pay and performance across the 
Group, including for the GEB, and, as a net result, the achievement level of the 2020/21 LTIP is below the maximum of 
100%.
What is the impact of the integration on outstanding deferred compensation plans across both entities? 
After the acquisition, the outstanding deferred compensation of both UBS and Credit Suisse employees generally 
continues to vest according to the original plan delivery schedule and subject to applicable performance conditions. 
UBS conducted a detailed review of Credit Suisse’s deferred compensation plans and aligned the performance metrics to 
those of UBS deferred compensation plans where applicable. Furthermore, where applicable, share-based plans of Credit 
Suisse were converted reflecting the merger conversion rate, to align with the Credit Suisse shareholder experience.
This approach underlines our philosophy to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders. Furthermore, it 
demonstrates a consistent treatment of employees with outstanding deferred compensation awards and ultimately 
supports operational stability and the economic and cultural integration of Credit Suisse.
What retention activities have supported the integration of Credit Suisse into UBS?
Performance management and reward play an important part in supporting the economic and cultural integration of 
Credit Suisse into UBS. We have therefore reviewed our Total Reward Principles and confirmed that they remain fully 
aligned with our purpose and support our strategic objectives. In the short-to-medium term, they also enable UBS to 
drive the economic and cultural integration of Credit Suisse and the long-term value creation of the combined firm.
Furthermore, we have swiftly implemented an integrated performance and reward year-end process for the combined 
firm, which supports our sustainable high performance culture and reflects our well-established approach to pay for 
performance. The compensation decisions for all employees were governed by the same Total Reward Principles. This 
integrated approach supported a one-firm employee experience and our emphasis on like-for-like outcomes for 
comparable performance and roles.
To support operational stability, manage risks and protect the client franchise, we have deployed specific additional 
measures. Retention awards were delivered in both deferred cash and deferred equity awards. Furthermore, to support 
our client win-back strategy and promote client growth, we also introduced a client acquisition and retention award for 
certain producers, which is fully deferred and the final value is linked to the retention of client assets. Retention efforts 
were targeted and limited to certain client roles and critical roles necessary to support operational stability. Overall, the 
amounts of USD 736m are modest by industry standards for an integration of this magnitude. These retention awards 
account for 3% of our total personnel expenses recognized in 2023.
In addition, we provided indications of 2023 incentive levels to a number of Credit Suisse employees, primarily in clientfacing roles, to emphasize that their compensation going forward would reflect appropriate levels of pay for performance. 
The UBS compensation framework and approach provides competitive pay for performance, further supporting stability 
going forward. Beyond financial compensation-related measures, our merger-related activities included non-financial 
aspects, such as a broad-based communication approach with Credit Suisse employees.
How did UBS support employees during the integration process?
Supporting employee health and well-being remained a priority in 2023. Resources to support holistic well-being included 
a range of programs, benefits and workplace resources, along with a bespoke eLearning curriculum that aimed to help 
our employees manage their health, foster well-being, strengthen their resilience and support the sustainability of the 
organization. In the context of the integration of Credit Suisse, we expanded our offering to include guidelines and 
instructor-led sessions on managing organizational change, uncertainty and resilience.
In 2023, we announced that existing social plans or support during redundancy at UBS and Credit Suisse had been 
aligned globally (where applicable) to ensure that all employees were treated equally. 
As an example, employees in the Swiss labor market affected by the restructuring are entitled to a program with a key 
focus on redeployment within UBS, and we have significantly increased the budget for education and training. Outside 
of the Swiss labor market, we provide severance payments that are governed by location-specific severance policies. At 
a minimum, we offer severance terms which comply with the applicable local laws. In many locations, we may provide 
severance packages negotiated with our local social partners that go beyond these minimum legal requirements or offer 
additional time in order to find a new position. In certain locations, we may also offer redeployment support from our 
internal recruiters or via external outplacement firms for employees affected by redundancies.
Advisory vote | Corporate governance and compensation | Compensation 230
Did UBS change the compensation framework for 2023?
We are convinced that our compensation framework remains best-in-class for our industry. Therefore, it remained broadly 
unchanged for 2023. The compensation approach reflects a substantial deferral into equity- and debt-based vehicles that 
support alignment with our shareholders and debtholders. Furthermore, the vesting period over five years remains one 
of the longest in the industry, providing for long employment and performance conditions.
For 2023, we will award the equity-aligned portion of compensation as part of the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP, as a 
replacement for the EOP) for the GEB and Managing Directors (MDs) reporting to the GEB and their direct reports at MD 
level. These senior leaders receive the equity portion of their 2023 performance award in LTIP to support delivering on 
our ambitious integration goals and business / financial targets. This further mitigates the need for a distinct integration 
award typical for a transaction of this nature.
What has changed in the 2023 LTIP (awarded in 2024)?
We maintain our overall LTIP with the same two equally weighted performance metrics (reported RoCET1 and relative 
Total Shareholder Return (rTSR)) over a three-year performance period, while making adjustments to the performance 
range of the RoCET1 metric. 
For the 2023 LTIP award (granted in 2024), the reported RoCET1 metric reflects the impact of the acquisition and our 
ambitious integration objectives, as well as the communicated financial ambitions over the cycle. As a consequence, we 
continue to use the reported basis for our RoCET1 metric, as this also considers the underlying business results and 
integration costs. For the 2023 performance year, we awarded the LTIP at a value of 50% of the maximum, to further 
align the maximum opportunity with the stretching nature of our financial ambitions.
The maximum reported RoCET1 of 10% corresponds with a 100% payout aligned with our stretch target. In contrast, 
the minimum reported RoCET1 of 5% corresponds with a 33% payout aligned with sustainable results in the context of 
the integration. Below the threshold of 5% reported RoCET1, the award is subject to full forfeiture.
The unchanged rTSR performance range of ±25 percentage points of UBS TSR compared with a peer group index TSR 
continues to demonstrate our ambition of delivering attractive relative returns to shareholders. The peer group consists 
of all listed Global Systemically Important Banks, which were independently defined by the Financial Stability Board in 
2023, and reflects companies with a comparable risk profile and impact on the global economy.
During the integration period, we have expanded the group that will receive LTIP to include Managing Directors (MDs) 
reporting to the GEB and their direct reports at MD level. We will continue to review the LTIP design, including the 
RoCET1 performance range, in consideration of our integration progress and financial ambitions.
What is the achievement level of the LTIP granted in 2021 for 2020 performance?
The deferred portion of the performance award granted in 2021 (for the 2020 financial performance year) to members 
of the GEB and selected senior management was in part delivered through the LTIP award. The three-year performance 
period concluded at the end of 2023, with the 2020 LTIP achieving 92.55% of the maximum opportunity (of up to 
100%). 
As explained above, the Compensation Committee made certain adjustments to the financial results used to determine 
the 2020 LTIP achievement level. As noted, if the Compensation Committee had not made these adjustments but had 
applied reported UBS Group AG financial results, the achievement level would have been 100%.
We believe alignment of our senior leadership with our shareholders is important for long-term success. Our LTIP is 
designed to support alignment of compensation with the execution of our strategy, financial performance and long-term 
growth.

Say-on-pay
Say-on-pay votes at the AGM
In line with the Swiss Code of Obligations, we seek binding shareholder approval for the aggregate compensation 
awarded to the Group Executive Board (the GEB) and the Board of Directors (the BoD). Prospective approval of the fixed 
compensation of the BoD and GEB provides the firm and its governing bodies with the certainty needed to operate 
effectively. Retrospective approval of the GEB’s variable compensation aligns their compensation with performance and 
contribution.
The table below outlines our compensation proposals, including supporting rationales, that we plan to submit to the 
2024 Annual General Meeting (the AGM) for binding votes, in line with the Swiss Code of Obligations and our Articles 
of Association.
These binding votes on compensation and the advisory vote on our Compensation Report reflect our commitment to 
shareholders having their say on pay.

Approved GEB fixed compensation and BoD compensation
At the 2022 AGM, the shareholders approved a maximum aggregate fixed compensation amount of CHF 33.0m for GEB 
members for the 2023 performance year. This budget reflects base salaries, role-based allowances in response to EU 
Capital Requirements Directive V, and estimated standard contributions to retirement benefit plans, as well as 
other benefits. The aggregate fixed compensation paid in 2023 to GEB members was below the approved amount for 
2023.
At the 2023 AGM, the shareholders approved a maximum aggregate amount of compensation of CHF 13.0m for the 
members of the BoD for the period from the 2023 AGM to the 2024 AGM. At the 2024 AGM, we will ask shareholders 
to exceptionally approve a retroactive incremental amount of CHF 2.2m of BoD compensation for the period from the 
2023 AGM to the 2024 AGM as outlined below. 

Compensation-related proposals for binding and advisory votes at the 2024 AGM 
Item Approved at the 2023 
AGM
BoD proposals for the 
2024 AGM
Rationale
GEB variable 
compensation
Shareholders approved 
CHF 81,100,000 for the 
2022 financial year1,2,3 
(vote “for”: 87.1%)
The BoD proposes an 
aggregate amount of 
variable compensation of 
CHF 108,286,300 for the 
members of the GEB for 
the 2023 financial year.
In 2023, we added four GEB members to successfully support the integration. The 
GEB performance award pool takes into account the changes in GEB composition 
and reflects the significant progress in the integration, including bringing 
operational stability to Credit Suisse after the announcement of the acquisition. It 
also reflects that the Group achieved underlying profitability following the closing 
of the acquisition and maintained the Group’s strong capital position. On a per 
capita basis, the GEB performance award pool decreased by 6%.
GEB fixed 
compensation
Shareholders approved 
CHF 33,000,000 for the 
2024 financial year1,2,3
(vote “for”: 89.3%)
The BoD proposes a 
maximum aggregate 
amount of fixed 
compensation of 
CHF 33,000,000 for the 
members of the GEB for 
the 2025 financial year.
The proposed amount is unchanged compared with last year despite the increase 
in the number of GEB members in 2023. It further reflects unchanged base salaries 
for the Group CEO and other GEB members.
Besides the base salaries, the amount also includes estimated standard contributions 
to retirement benefit plans, as well as other benefits. The proposed amount provides 
flexibility in light of potential changes of GEB composition or roles, competitive 
considerations as well as other factors (e.g., changes in FX rates or benefits).
n. a. The BoD proposes an 
incremental amount of 
compensation of 
CHF 2,200,000 for the 
members of the BoD for 
the period from the 2023 
AGM to the 2024 AGM.
As a result of the integration of Credit Suisse, in 2023 we expanded the roles of 
certain members of the Board of Directors of UBS Group AG to take on additional 
responsibilities in the boards of directors of significant subsidiary entities. These 
nominations are critical to providing strong governance and oversight of the 
subsidiaries, in a manner consistent and in compliance with UBS Group AG’s 
governance principles, as well as to facilitating the integration of Credit Suisse 
entities into UBS.
Neither the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group nor the appointments to 
subsidiary board roles were anticipated when the maximum amount for BoD fees 
of CHF 13m was submitted at the 2023 AGM. As a result, while the spend for the 
BoD of UBS Group AG is within the approved amount, we propose that 
shareholders approve a retroactive incremental amount of CHF 2.2m for the period 
from the 2023 AGM to the 2024 AGM to support the additional subsidiary board 
fees amount that exceeds the original approval at the 2023 AGM.
As a reminder, shareholders of UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG had 
approved at their respective 2023 AGM an aggregate amount for board of director 
compensation of combined total CHF 26m. The estimated total BoD spend in the 
period from the 2023 AGM to the 2024 AGM is CHF 18.1m, of which CHF 15.2m 
for the Board of Directors of UBS Group AG and the remaining amount for the 
board of directors of Credit Suisse Group AG (pre-merger close) and Credit Suisse 
AG (post-merger close). As a result, the overall BoD spend is CHF 7.9m lower 
compared with the combined approved aggregate amount.
BoD 
compensation
Shareholders approved 
CHF 13,000,000 for the 
period from the 2023 
AGM to the 2024 
AGM1,2,4
(vote “for”: 88.0%)
The BoD proposes a 
maximum aggregate 
amount of compensation 
of CHF 16,500,000 for the 
members of the BoD for 
the period from the 2024 
AGM to the 2025 AGM.
The proposed amount reflects all BoD fees, including the total compensation of the 
Chairman and the Vice Chairman role, as well as subsidiary fees of certain UBS 
Group AG members for their mandates in significant subsidiary entities. The overall 
amount is higher compared with the previous period which reflects the fees to 
certain BoD members for their continued critical roles in the board of directors of 
significant subsidiary entities. It also includes a higher fee for the Chairman to reflect 
the significantly increased scope, responsibility and complexity following the 
acquisition of Credit Suisse. The fees for other BoD members including the Vice 
Chairman remain unchanged.
Advisory vote 
on the 
Compensation 
Report
Shareholders approved the 
UBS Group AG 
Compensation Report 
2022 in an advisory vote 
(vote “for”: 85.6%)
The BoD proposes that the 
UBS Group AG 
Compensation Report 
2023 be ratified in an 
advisory vote.
Our Total Reward Principles and overall compensation framework continue to be 
aligned with our purpose and remain relevant to the Group’s commitment to 
delivering long-term shareholder value. It is imperative that our pay approach 
equally recognizes and supports the economic and cultural integration of Credit 
Suisse to create long-term value for the combined firm. Overall, the compensation 
framework for all employees, including the GEB, remains broadly unchanged and 
our decisions continue to reflect our diligent approach to considering a balanced 
allocation of profit between shareholders and employees over the cycle, as well as 
supporting strong capital returns, including reflecting the appropriate risk 
awareness in our business decisions.

in “Group Executive Board” in the “Corporate governance” section of this report, 16 GEB members were in office on 31 December 2023 and twelve GEB members were in office on 31 December 2022. 4 Twelve BoD 
members were in office on 31 December 2023 and on 31 December 2022.

Compensation philosophy and governance
Our compensation philosophy
Total Reward Principles
Our Total Reward Principles provide a strong link to our strategic imperatives and encourage employees to live our strong 
and inclusive culture that is grounded in our three keys to success: our Pillars, Principles and Behaviors. These guiding 
principles underpin our approach to compensation and define our compensation framework. Following a comprehensive 
review in 2023, we concluded that our Total Reward Principles and compensation framework are well aligned with our 
purpose and support our strategic imperatives. This aims to ensure that the interests of our employees are aligned with 
those of our clients and other stakeholders. In the short-to-medium term, they also enable UBS to drive the economic 
and cultural integration of Credit Suisse and the long-term value creation of the combined firm.
Therefore, our compensation approach supports our capital strength and risk management and provides for simplification 
and efficiency. It encourages employees to focus on client centricity, connectivity and sustainable impact in everything 
we do. Moreover, we reward behaviors that help build and protect the firm’s reputation, specifically Accountability with 
integrity, Collaboration and Innovation. Compensation for each employee is based on individual, team, business division 
and Group performance, within the context of the markets in which we operate.
Total Reward Principles
Our Total Reward Principles apply to all employees globally but vary in certain locations according to local legal 
requirements, regulations and practices. The table below provides a summary of our Total Reward Principles.
Support our purpose and strategy Our compensation approach supports the firm’s purpose and strategy, fosters engagement among 
employees and aligns their long-term interests with those of clients and stakeholders.
Attract, retain and connect a diverse, 
talented workforce
We embrace a culture of diversity, equity and inclusiveness. Pay at UBS is fair, reflects equal treatment and 
is competitive. In this way, our investment in a connected workforce supports the sustainability of the 
organization.
Apply a pay-for-performance approach to 
promote development and our ways of 
working
The setting of clear objectives, as well as a thorough evaluation of what was achieved and how it was 
achieved, combined with effective communication, promotes clarity, accountability and establishes a 
strong link between pay and performance. This approach emphasizes our Behaviors, which are 
Accountability with integrity, Collaboration and Innovation.
Reinforce sustainable growth and support 
long-term value creation
Compensation is appropriately balanced between fixed and variable elements and delivered over an 
adequate period to support our growth ambitions and sustainable performance.
Support risk awareness and appropriate 
risk-taking
Our compensation structure encourages employees to have a focus on risk management and behave 
consistently with the firm’s risk framework and appetite, thereby anticipating and managing risks 
effectively to protect our capital and reputation.
Our Total Reward approach
At UBS, we apply a holistic Total Reward approach, generally consisting of fixed compensation (base salary and rolebased allowances, if applicable), performance awards, pension contributions and benefits. Our Total Reward approach is 
structured to support sustainable results and growth ambitions.
For employees whose total compensation exceeds certain levels, performance awards are delivered in a combination of 
cash, deferred contingent capital awards and deferred share-based awards.
A substantial portion of performance awards is deferred and vests over a five-year period (or longer for certain regulated 
employees). This deferral approach supports alignment of employee and investor interests, our capital base and the 
creation of sustainable shareholder value.

Compensation governance
Board of Directors and Compensation Committee
The Board of Directors (the BoD) is ultimately responsible for approving the compensation strategy and principles 
proposed by the Compensation Committee, which determines compensation-related matters in line with the principles 
set forth in the Articles of Association (the AoA).
As determined in the AoA and the firm’s Organization Regulations, the Compensation Committee supports the BoD with 
its duties to set guidelines on compensation and benefits, to oversee implementation thereof, to approve certain 
compensation and to scrutinize executive performance. The Compensation Committee consists of independent BoD 
members, who are elected annually by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (the AGM), and is responsible for 
governance and oversight of our compensation process and practices. This includes the alignment between pay and 
performance, and ensuring that the compensation framework supports appropriate risk awareness and management, as 
well as appropriate risk-taking. In 2023, to additionally support the connection between the Compensation Committee 
and the Risk Committee, the Compensation Committee Chairperson was also a member of the Risk Committee.
Annually, and on behalf of the BoD, the Compensation Committee:
– reviews our Total Reward Principles;
– approves key features of the compensation framework and plans for the non-independent BoD members and 
members of the Group Executive Board (the GEB);
– reviews performance award funding throughout the year and proposes, upon proposal of the Group CEO, the final 
annual Group performance award pool to the BoD for approval;
– upon proposal of the Group CEO, reviews the performance framework for the other GEB members;
– upon proposal of the Group CEO, proposes the performance assessments and the individual total compensation for 
the other GEB members for approval by the BoD;
– upon proposal of the Chairman, for the Group CEO, proposes the financial and non-financial performance targets and 
objectives, the performance assessment and the total compensation for approval by the BoD;
– approves the total compensation for the Chairman and the non-independent BoD members;
– upon proposal of the Chairman, proposes the remuneration / fee framework for independent BoD members for 
approval by the BoD; 
– upon proposal of the Chairman and the Group CEO, approves the remuneration / fee frameworks for external 
supervisory board members of Significant Group Entities and is informed of remuneration / fee frameworks for external 
supervisory board members of Significant Regional Entities;
– proposes to the BoD for approval the annual compensation report and approves other material public disclosures on 
UBS compensation matters; and
– proposes to the BoD, for approval by the AGM, the maximum aggregate amounts of BoD compensation and GEB 
fixed compensation and the aggregate amount of variable compensation for the GEB.
The Compensation Committee is required to meet at least four times each year. All meetings in 2023 were held in the 
presence of the Chairman, the respective Group CEOs and external advisors. In addition, three ad hoc calls took place, 
most of which were attended by the Chairman and by external advisors. Individuals, including the Chairman and the 
Group CEO, are not permitted to attend a meeting or participate in a discussion on their own performance and 
compensation.
After the meetings, the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee reports to the BoD on the Compensation 
Committee’s activities and discussions and, if necessary, submits proposals for approval by the full BoD. Compensation 
Committee meeting minutes are also sent to all members of the BoD. On 31 December 2023, the members of the 
Compensation Committee were Julie G. Richardson (Chairperson), Dieter Wemmer and Jeanette Wong.

External advisors
The Compensation Committee may retain external advisors to support it in fulfilling its duties. In 2023, HCM International 
Ltd. (HCM) provided independent advice on compensation matters. HCM holds no other mandates with UBS. 
Additionally, Willis Towers Watson provided the Compensation Committee with data on market trends and pay levels. 
Various subsidiaries of Willis Towers Watson provide similar information to UBS’s human resources department in relation 
to compensation for employees, including advisory services and secondments to UBS on benefits and year-end 
compensation activities. Willis Towers Watson holds no other compensation-related mandates with UBS.
The Risk Committee’s role in compensation
The Risk Committee, a committee of the BoD, works closely with the Compensation Committee with the goal of ensuring 
that our compensation framework appropriately reflects risk awareness and management, and supports appropriate risktaking. It supervises and sets appropriate risk management and risk control principles and is regularly briefed on how risk 
is factored into the compensation process. It also monitors the involvement of Group Risk Control and Compliance and 
Operational Risk in compensation and reviews risk-related aspects of the compensation process.

Environmental, social and governance considerations 
Environmental, social and governance objectives in the compensation process
Our compensation determination process considers environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives in objective 
setting, performance award pool funding, performance evaluation and individual compensation decisions.
ESG-related objectives have been embedded in our Pillars and Principles since they were established in 2011. In 2021, 
we introduced explicit sustainability objectives in the non-financial goal category of the Group CEO and GEB performance 
scorecards. In 2023, we further enhanced the GEB performance scorecard framework by establishing separate 
Environmental & Sustainability and People & Governance categories. The objectives in these categories are linked to our 
sustainability priorities, and their progress is measured via robust quantitative metrics and qualitative criteria. The table 
below provides an overview of our metrics and progress achieved in 2023, including climate-related goals under the 
priority “Planet.” Sustainability objectives are assessed for each GEB member on an individual basis, directly impacting 
their respective performance assessments and compensation decisions.
The determination of the Group performance award pool funding also takes into account ESG factors. Aside from 
financial performance, an assessment of progress is made against objectives linked to our focus areas of Planet, People 
(including progress made against our diversity aspirations) and Partnerships, alongside other key non-financial 
considerations. Therefore, ESG is taken into consideration when the Compensation Committee assesses performance 
and compensation of each GEB member. Additionally, the assessment impacts the overall performance award pool for 
the Group.
Going forward, we will continue to review and refine the role of ESG considerations in our performance and 
compensation framework, to ensure they remain aligned to our strategic priorities and the sustainable growth of 
shareholder value.

Fair and equitable pay
Pay equity and equal opportunity are fundamental to achieving our purpose. The diversity of our employees in terms of 
experiences, perspectives and backgrounds is critical to our success. Factors such as gender, race, ethnicity or part-time 
status should not impact opportunities available to our employees.
Fair and consistent pay practices are designed to ensure that employees are appropriately rewarded for their contribution. 
We pay for performance, and we take pay equity seriously. We have embedded clear commitments in our global 
compensation policies and practices. We regularly conduct internal reviews and independent external audits on pay 
equity, and our statistical analyses show a differential between men and women in similar roles across our major locations 
of less than 1%. 
In 2020, we completed an equal pay analysis in Switzerland, as required by the Swiss Federal Act on Gender Equality. 
The results confirmed that we are fully compliant with Swiss equal pay standards. Beginning in 2020, UBS was certified 
(through 2023) by the EQUAL-SALARY Foundation for our HR practices, including compensation, in Switzerland, the US, 
UK, the Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, covering more than two-thirds of our global employee population. All of our HR 
policies are global, and we apply the same standards across all locations. Furthermore, we review our approach and 
policies annually to support our continuous improvement. In 2023, we fully integrated former Credit Suisse Group 
employees into all of our fair pay practices and continued to monitor and improve our pay equity position in our leading 
countries.
We also aim to ensure that all employees are paid at least a living wage. We regularly assess employees’ salaries against 
local living wages, using benchmarks defined by the Fair Wage Network. Excluding our US financial advisor staff (as their 
compensation is primarily based on a formulaic approach), our analysis in 2023 showed that employees’ salaries were at 
or above the respective benchmarks.

Our aspirations and progress
Following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, our exposure increased accordingly, so we reviewed our aspirations. 
Amendments that arose from this review process were considered by the Group Executive Board and the UBS Group 
Board of Directors’ Corporate Culture and Responsibility Committee. This table reflects the overall outcomes of this 
process with more detailed information provided in the UBS Group Sustainability Report 2023.

activities to our targets, it is important to note that progress towards our targets may not be linear and that the realization of our own targets and aspirations is dependent on various factors which are outside of our 
direct influence. We will continue to adjust our approach in line with external developments and evolving best practices for the financial sector and climate science. Refer to the Supplement to the UBS Group 
Sustainability Report 2023, available under “Annual reporting” at ubs.com/investors, for more information about parts of the value chain within sectors covered by metrics and targets. Metrics are based on gross 
exposure, which includes total loans and advances to customers, fair value loans and guarantees, and irrevocable loan commitments. Exclusions from the scope of analysis primarily include financial services, credit

trajectories. The PP are a framework for assessing and disclosing, on an annual basis, the climate alignment of in-scope ship finance portfolios to the ambition of the International Maritime Organization (the IMO), 
including its 2023 Revised GHG Strategy for GHG emissions from international shipping to decrease to net zero by or around 2050 (compared with 2008 levels). 4 Refer to the “Environment” section of the UBS 
Group Sustainability Report 2023, available under “Annual reporting” at ubs.com/investors, for further information. The inherent one-year time lag between the as-of date of our lending exposure and the as-of date 
of emissions can be explained by two factors: corporations disclose their emissions in annual reporting only a few months after the end of a financial year; and specialized third-party data providers take up to nine 
months to collect disclosed data and make it available to data users. Consequently, the baselines for our decarbonization targets are calculated on year-end 2021 lending exposure and 2020 emissions data. Our 
2022 emissions actuals are based on year-end 2022 lending exposure and 2021 emissions data. For asset financing (e.g., real estate, shipping) there is no time lag, and exposure and emissions actuals refer to the 
same year. 5 The 20% alignment goal amounted to USD 235bn at the time of pre-acquisition Asset Management’s commitment in 2021. By 2030, the weighted average carbon intensity of funds is to be 50% 
below the carbon intensity of the respective 2019 benchmark. 6 Scope 2 emissions are market-based emissions. The remaining scope 1 and 2 emissions may be in excess of the approximately 5–10% residuals 
required for net zero (per the definition of a “net-zero target” by the ESRS E1 Climate Change per delegated act, adopted on 31 July 2023), which is our ambition for 2050. In 2024, we will be reviewing our 2025 
scope 1 and 2 target for achievability for the combined organization and alignment with latest guidance. 7 In 2024, we may review our targets for GHG key vendors for the combined organization and alignment 
with latest guidance. Our GHG key vendors are those vendors that collectively account for more than 50% of our estimated vendor GHG emissions. 8 Figures provided for the UBS Optimus network of foundations 
are based on unaudited management accounts and information available as of January 2024. Audited financial statements for UBS Optimus network of foundations entities are produced and available per local

Cautionary note: We have developed methodologies that we use to set our climate-related targets and identify climate-related risks and which underly the metrics that are disclosed in this report. Standard-setting 
organizations and regulators continue to provide new or revised guidance and standards, as well as new or enhanced regulatory requirements for climate disclosures. Our disclosed metrics are based upon data available 
to us, including estimates and approximations where actual or specific data is not available. We intend to update our disclosures to comply with new guidance and regulatory requirements as they become applicable 
to UBS. Such updates may result in revisions to our disclosed metrics, our methodologies and related disclosures, which may be substantial, as well as changes to the metrics we disclose.

Build a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace
Increasing our gender and ethnic diversity is a strategic priority. We want to support and enable more women to build 
long and satisfying careers with UBS, and we are committed to increasing the representation of women at senior levels. 
Equally, investing in attracting, supporting and advancing our ethnically diverse employees is a key focus for the firm. We 
take a multi-pronged approach, examining the process, culture and organization design elements around hiring, 
promoting and retaining women and ethnic minority background employees at all levels, and senior management are 
accountable for driving change. 
Efforts towards progressing our aspirations are considered in the determination of the annual performance award pool 
and included in the sustainability objectives under “People and Governance” and “Environmental and Sustainability” for 
the GEB, as outlined in the table above.

Performance award pool funding
Our compensation philosophy focuses on balancing performance with appropriate risk-taking, retaining talented 
employees and shareholder returns. Our overall performance award pool funding percentage decreases as financial 
performance increases. In years of strong financial performance, this prevents excessive compensation and results in an 
increased proportion of profit before performance awards being available for distribution to shareholders or growing the 
Group’s capital. In years where performance declines, the performance award pool will generally decrease; however, the 
funding percentage may increase.
Advisory vote | Corporate governance and compensation | Compensation 239
Our performance award pool funding framework is based on Group and business division performance, including 
achievements against defined performance measures. For the avoidance of doubt, we have excluded the positive and 
negative financial impacts generated by the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group (such as the negative goodwill of 
USD 27.7bn) from consideration in our performance award pool determination process. In assessing performance, we also 
consider relative performance versus peers, market competitiveness of our pay position, as well as progress against our 
strategic and integration objectives, including returns, risk-weighted assets and cost efficiency. The Risk and Compliance 
functions support our holistic reflection and consideration of the financial and non-financial impact (including reputation) 
of risk matters. We further consider the firm’s risk profile and culture, the extent to which operational risks and audit issues 
have been identified and resolved, and the success of risk reduction initiatives including accountability for significant events. 
The funding for Group functions is linked to overall Group performance and also reflects factors such as headcount and 
workforce location. For each functional area, quantitative and qualitative assessments evaluate service quality, risk 
management and financial achievements. 
Our decisions regarding the total Group performance award pool also balance consideration of financial performance 
with a range of factors, including DE&I and other ESG metrics, the impact of litigation, regulatory costs, the effect of 
changes in financial accounting standards, capital returns and relative total shareholder return.
In 2023, in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, we have also considered the complexity of the transaction 
as well as the need to retain key talent and stabilize the franchise during the integration period. Furthermore, and in line 
with our existing commitment to fair pay and diversity, equity and inclusion, we took great care to support fairness and 
equity across the organization, with a focus on like-for-like outcomes for comparable roles and performance across the 
Group. Overall, this further supports our sustainable high performance culture and reflects our well-established approach 
to pay for performance. As the integration progresses, we may consider further adjustments in the future to support 
near-term targets and progress toward the completion of the integration.
Before making its final proposal to the BoD, the Compensation Committee considers the Group CEO’s proposals and can 
apply a positive or negative adjustment to the performance award pool.

Compensation for GEB members
GEB compensation framework
In 2023, the Compensation Committee reviewed the GEB compensation framework and concluded that it remains well 
suited to support the alignment of compensation with the execution of our strategy, sustainable performance and the 
delivery of our integration goals. The chart below illustrates the compensation elements, pay mix and key features for 
GEB members. Of the annual performance award, 20% is paid in the form of cash and 80% is deferred over a period of 
five years,1
 with 50% of the annual performance awards granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP) and 30% 
under the Deferred Contingent Capital Plan (the DCCP).

Pay-for-performance safeguards for GEB members
Performance 
award caps
– Cap on the total GEB performance award pool (2.5% of profit before tax)1
– Caps on individual performance awards (for the Group CEO capped at five times the annual fixed compensation rate and at seven times 
for the other GEB members). Going forward, the GEB, including the Group CEO, will be subject to a cap of seven times their annual fixed 
compensation rate.
– Cap of 20% of performance award in cash
Delivery and 
deferral
– 80% of performance awards are at risk of forfeiture
– Long-term deferral over five years (or longer for certain regulated GEB members)
– Alignment with shareholders (through the LTIP) and bondholders (through the DCCP)
– Final payout of equity-based LTIP award (50% of performance award) subject to absolute and relative performance conditions (threeyear performance period)
Contract
terms
– No severance terms
– Notice period between six and twelve months
Other 
safeguards
– Share ownership requirements
– No hedging allowed
– GEB variable compensation subject to clawback in line with US regulatory requirements
1 The Compensation Committee may consider adjustments to profit for items that are not reflective of underlying performance including integration items.
Effective 2 October 2023, we have implemented a clawback policy for current and former GEB members based on the 
US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirement for listed companies on US national securities exchanges / 
associations. This clawback policy is applied if UBS is required to prepare an accounting restatement of financial 
statements due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements. In that event, UBS would consider 
recovering the amount of variable compensation that exceeds the amount that would have been determined based on 
the restated financial statements (the final amount will be determined at the discretion of the Compensation Committee).
GEB share ownership requirements
To align the interests of GEB members with those of our shareholders and to demonstrate personal commitment to the 
firm, we require all GEB members including the Group CEO to hold a substantial number of UBS shares. GEB members 
must reach their minimum shareholding requirements within five years from their appointment and retain it throughout 
their tenure. The total number of UBS shares held by a GEB member consists of any vested or unvested shares, including 
privately held shares. At the end of 2023, all GEB members met their share ownership requirements, except for those 
appointed within the last three years, who still have time to build up and meet the required share ownership.
As of 31 December 2023, our GEB members held shares with an aggregate value of approximately USD 388m. 
Share ownership requirements
Group CEO min. 1,000,000 shares
Other GEB members min. 500,000 shares
Must be built up within five years from their appointment and retained throughout 
their tenure
GEB base salary and role-based allowance
Each GEB member receives a fixed base salary, which is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee. The 2023 
annual base salary for the Group CEO role was CHF 2.5m and has remained unchanged since 2011. The other GEB 
members each received a base salary of CHF 1.5m (or local currency equivalent), also unchanged since 2011.
Regarding the fixed compensation of the former members of the Credit Suisse Executive Board (the ExB), after the 
acquisition and considering the change in roles of former ExB members, we have reduced their fixed compensation 
following their contractual notice period to align with UBS fixed compensation levels for below Group Executive Board 
(GEB) employees. For the former CEO of Credit Suisse Group AG, who became a GEB member after the acquisition, the 
fixed compensation was also reduced to align with UBS fixed compensation levels for other GEB members.
Over the course of 2023, two GEB members held a UK Senior Management Function (an SMF) role for one of our UK 
entities and one GEB member was identified as a UK-regulated Material Risk Taker (an MRT). In addition to base salary, 
a role-based allowance was part of their fixed compensation.
At the Annual General Meeting (the AGM), the shareholders are asked to approve the maximum aggregate amount of 
fixed compensation for GEB members for the following financial year. 
› Refer to the “Supplemental information” section of this report for more information about MRTs and SMFs

Advisory vote | Corporate governance and compensation | Compensation 242
Caps on the GEB performance award pool
The size of the GEB performance award pool may not exceed 2.5% of the Group’s profit before tax. This limits the overall 
GEB compensation based on the firm’s profitability. For 2023, the total GEB performance award pool was CHF 108.3m 
and below the 2.5% cap, when applying profit before tax on an adjusted basis to exclude both the positive and negative 
one-time financial impacts of the Credit Suisse acquisition (as explained in the 2023 key compensation themes section 
of this report). These adjustments from reported results reflect the rigorous internal review as well as the judgment of 
the Compensation Committee.
In line with the individual compensation caps on the proportion of fixed pay to variable pay for all GEB members 
(introduced in 2013), the Group CEO’s granted performance award (at communicated value) is capped at five times his 
annual fixed compensation rate. Granted performance awards (at communicated value) of other GEB members are 
capped at seven times their annual fixed compensation rate. For 2023, performance awards (at communicated value) 
granted to all GEB members including the Group CEO were, on average, 3.8 times their fixed compensation (in Swiss 
franc terms, excluding one-time replacement awards, benefits and contributions to retirement plans). Going forward, 
the GEB, including the Group CEO, will be subject to a cap of seven times their annual fixed compensation rate.
› Refer to “Performance award pool funding” in the “Compensation philosophy and governance” section of this report for more 
information
GEB employment contracts
GEB members’ employment contracts do not include severance terms and are subject to a notice period of between six 
and twelve months. A GEB member leaving UBS before the end of a performance year may be considered for a 
performance award. Such awards are subject to approval by the BoD, and ultimately by the shareholders at the AGM.
Benchmarking for GEB members
When recommending performance awards for the Group CEO and the other GEB members, the Compensation 
Committee reviews the respective total compensation for each role against a financial industry peer group. The peer 
group is selected based on comparability of their size, business mix, geographic presence and the extent to which they 
compete with us for talent. The Compensation Committee considers our peers’ strategies, practices and pay levels, as 
well as their regulatory environment; it also periodically reviews other firms’ pay levels or practices, including both 
financial and non-financial sector peers, as applicable. The total compensation for a GEB member’s specific role considers 
the compensation paid by our peers for a comparable role and performance within the context of our organizational 
profile. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews and approves the peer group composition.
The table below presents the composition of our peer group as approved by the Compensation Committee for the 2023 
performance year.

GEB performance assessments
We assess each GEB member’s performance against a set of Group financial targets, non-financial objectives and 
Behaviors. For 2023, we revised the non-financial objectives to increase focus on the integration. Specifically, we updated 
and consolidated the categories to focus on delivering integration- and strategy-related initiatives, client centricity, risk 
and regulatory, environmental and sustainability, and people- and governance-related objectives. This approach 
continues to foster a focus on GEB priorities, including delivering the integration objectives and the success of the Group, 
and promotes strong individual accountability.
The Compensation Committee exercises its judgment with respect to the performance achieved relative to the prior year, 
our strategic plan and our competitors, and considers the Group CEO’s proposals. The Compensation Committee’s 
proposals are subject to approval by the BoD.
The Compensation Committee, and then the full BoD, follows a similar process for the Group CEO, except that the 
proposal comes from the Chairman of the BoD.

Performance assessment for the Group CEO
Sergio Ermotti joined UBS on 1 April 2023 and took on accountability as Group CEO on 5 April 2023. The Board of Directors 
(the BoD) recognizes Mr. Ermotti’s excellent performance in a defining year in UBS’s history and strong progress in delivering 
on integration priorities. He was instrumental in quickly stabilizing the client franchise, managing risks, and bringing 
operational stability to Credit Suisse after the announcement of the acquisition. He successfully led the closing of the 
transaction in three months, the early repayment of the Public Liquidity Backstop and Emergency Liquidity Assistance Plus 
and the termination of the Loss Protection Agreement. His vision, drive and ambition for this transaction have resulted in 
an ambitious integration plan. Throughout the year, Mr. Ermotti was an extremely effective ambassador internally and 
externally for the combined firm and the significant value we can deliver in the future for all our stakeholders.
While the 2023 financial results were impacted by the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, we achieved underlying 
profitability following the closing of the acquisition and maintained the Group’s strong capital position with both the CET1 
capital ratio and the CET1 leverage ratio in excess of our guidance. Our capital strength enabled us to buy back USD 1.3bn 
of shares in 2023 and to propose to the shareholders a dividend of USD 0.70 per share, a 27% increase year-on-year.
The BoD also acknowledges that Mr. Ermotti was a role model in promoting client centricity. He personally remained 
engaged with clients and focused the organization on serving clients and putting them at the heart of everything we do. 
This resulted in strong momentum with our clients as evidenced by positive net new money and net new deposits across 
Global Wealth Management and Personal & Corporate Banking since the closing of the acquisition in 2023.
Further, Mr. Ermotti set a clear tone from the top on risk culture and risk management. He demonstrated a strong 
oversight on risk remediation items including addressing those resulting from the integration, challenged appropriately 
and kept the Group focused on adhering to our well-established risk management and control principles.
Mr. Ermotti swiftly and successfully re-composed the Group Executive Board (the GEB) to effectively manage the 
ambitious integration targets. He also took decisive action to stabilize the organization on the people side and to focus 
on maintaining operational stability, protecting the client franchise and managing risks. In addition, Mr. Ermotti made it 
a priority to drive cultural aspects into the combined organization by personally championing the Three Keys culture 
program. He also continued to successfully progress on the Group’s sustainability strategy with its key focus areas Planet 
(including net zero commitments), People (including progress on diversity, equity and inclusion ambitions) and 
Partnerships.
As explained above, the Compensation Committee made certain adjustments to the financial results used to determine 
the Group CEO performance award for 2023. If the Compensation Committee had not made these adjustments but had 
applied reported UBS Group AG financial results, i.e., including all acquisition-related effects, the achievement level for 
the Group PBT and RoCET1 performance measures would have been 100% and the weighted assessment score across 
all financial performance measures would have been higher. This would not have been representative of the achievements 
versus the targets defined for the 2023 performance year prior to the acquisition.
The table below illustrates the assessment criteria used to evaluate the achievements of Mr. Ermotti in 2023.

who are also MRTs or SMFs, the cash portion includes blocked shares. 4 LTIP awards for performance year 2023 were awarded at a value of 50.00% of maximum which reflects our best estimate of the value of the 
award. The maximum number of shares is determined by dividing the awarded amount by the estimated value of the award at grant, divided by CHF 24.435 or USD 27.936, the average closing price of UBS shares 
over the last ten trading days leading up to and including the award date in February. 5 The amounts reflect the amount of the notional additional tier 1 (AT1) capital instrument excluding future notional interest.

and CHF 841,402, respectively, are for the highest-paid GEB member (excluding replacement awards). The legally required employees’ social security contributions are included in the amounts shown in the table 
above, as appropriate. 7 The 2022 total compensation of Sarah Youngwood, the former Group CFO, including both the one-time replacement awards of her compensation forfeited upon joining UBS as well as her 
compensation for the 2022 performance year, amounts to a total of CHF 13,475,863 (which makes her the highest paid executive for 2022 including replacement awards). 8 As stated in “Group Executive Board” 
in the “Corporate governance” section of this report, 16 GEB members were in office on 31 December 2023 and twelve GEB members were in office on 31 December 2022. 9 Includes compensation paid under

Total realized compensation for the Group CEO
The realized compensation for the Group CEO reflects the total amount paid out in the year. It includes the base salary, 
cash performance award payments, and all deferred performance awards vested in the year. As such, realized pay is the 
natural culmination of awards granted and approved by shareholders in previous years.
To illustrate the effect of our long-term deferral approach, which has been in place since 2012, we disclose the annual 
realized compensation of Mr. Ermotti, including a comparison with his total awarded compensation.

Group compensation
Compensation elements for all employees
All elements of pay are considered when making our compensation decisions. We regularly review our principles and 
compensation framework in order to remain competitive and aligned with stakeholders’ interests. In 2023, our 
compensation framework remained broadly unchanged. We will continue to review our approach to salaries and 
performance awards, considering market developments, our performance and our commitment to deliver sustainable 
returns to shareholders.
Base salary and role-based allowance
Employees’ fixed compensation (e.g., base salary) reflects their level of skill, role and experience, as well as local market 
practice. Base salaries are usually paid monthly or fortnightly, in line with local market practice. We offer competitive 
base salaries that reflect location, function and role. Salary increases generally consider promotions, skill set, performance 
and overall responsibility.
In addition to base salary, and as part of fixed compensation, some employees may receive a role-based allowance. This 
allowance is a shift in the compensation mix between fixed and variable compensation, not an increase in total 
compensation. It reflects the market value of a specific role and is fixed, non-forfeitable compensation. Unlike salary, a 
role-based allowance is paid only if the employee is in a specific role. Similar to previous years, 2023 role-based allowances 
consisted of a cash portion and, where applicable, a blocked UBS share award.
Pensions and benefits
We provide access to a range of benefit plans, such as retirement benefits and health insurance, aiming to provide 
financial protection in case of significant life events, and support our employees’ well-being and diverse needs. Retirement 
and other benefits are set in the context of local market practice and regularly reviewed for competitiveness. 
Pension plan rules in any one location are generally the same for all employees in similar circumstances, including GEB 
members and other management. Under the Switzerland Pension Fund rules of UBS legal entities, there are no enhanced 
or supplementary pension contributions for the GEB. The CEO of Credit Suisse AG, who became a GEB member after 
the legal close of the acquisition, participates in the Switzerland Pension Fund for Credit Suisse legal entities.
Performance award
Most of our employees are eligible for an annual performance award. The level of this award, where applicable, generally 
depends on the firm’s overall performance, the employee’s business division, team and individual performance, and 
behavior, reflecting their overall contribution to the firm’s results. These awards are in line with applicable local 
employment conditions and at the discretion of the firm.
In addition to the firm’s Pillars and Principles, Behaviors related to Accountability with integrity, Collaboration and 
Innovation are part of the performance management approach. Therefore, when assessing performance, we consider 
not only what was achieved but also how it was achieved.
Our deferred compensation plans
Underlining our emphasis on sustainable performance and risk management, and our focus on achieving our growth 
ambitions, we deliver part of our employees’ annual variable compensation through deferred compensation plans. We 
believe that our approach, with a single incentive decision and mandatory deferral framework, is transparent and well 
suited to implementing our compensation philosophy and delivering sustainable performance. This aligns the interests of 
our employees and shareholders and appropriately links compensation to longer-term sustainable performance. 
Our mandatory deferral approach applies to all employees with regulatory-driven deferral requirements or total 
compensation greater than USD / CHF 300,000. Certain regulated employees, such as Senior Management Functions 
(SMFs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), are subject to additional requirements (e.g., more stringent deferral requirements 
and additional blocking periods). In addition, SMFs and MRTs receive 50% of their cash portion in the form of immediately 
vested shares, which are blocked for 12 months after grant. 
The deferred amount increases at higher marginal rates in line with the value of the performance award. The effective 
deferral rate therefore depends on the amount of the performance award and the amount of total compensation.
We believe our deferral regime has one of the longest vesting periods in the industry. The weighted average deferral 
period for non-regulated employees is 4.4 years for GEB members, 3.8 years for MDs receiving LTIP and 3.5 years for 
other employees. Additionally, from time to time, we may utilize alternative deferred compensation arrangements to 
remain competitive in specific business areas.
Advisory vote | Corporate governance and compensation | Compensation 249
To further promote sustainable performance, all of our deferred compensation plans include employment conditions and 
malus conditions. These enable the firm to reduce or fully forfeit unvested deferred awards under certain circumstances, 
pursuant to performance and harmful acts provisions. In addition, forfeiture is triggered in cases where employment has 
been terminated for cause.
Upon vesting of the notional share awards, we fulfill our share delivery obligations by delivering treasury shares purchased 
in the market.

Long-Term Incentive Plan
The Long-Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP) granted for 2023 performance is a mandatory deferral plan for GEB members 
and Managing Directors (MDs) reporting to the GEB and their direct reports at MD level.1
 These senior leaders receive 
the equity portion of their 2023 performance award in LTIP to support delivering on our ambitious integration goals and 
business / financial targets. This further mitigates the need for a distinct integration award typical for a transaction of this 
nature. For the 2023 performance year, we awarded the LTIP to 18 GEB members and 940 MDs in office during 2023, 
at a value of 50.0% of the maximum, to further align the maximum opportunity with the stretching nature of our 
financial ambitions. 
The performance metrics of the share-based LTIP awards are average reported return on CET1 capital (RoCET1) and 
relative total shareholder return (rTSR) over a three-year performance period starting on 1 January in the year of grant. 
Performance outcomes and actual payout levels will be disclosed at the end of the performance period.
The three-year average reported RoCET1 metric (50% weighting) with a performance range of 5% to 10% reflects the 
impact of the acquisition and our ambitious integration objectives, as well as the communicated financial ambitions over 
the cycle:
– the maximum reported RoCET1 of 10% corresponds with a 100% payout aligned with our stretch target;
– the minimum reported RoCET1 of 5% corresponds with a 33% payout aligned with sustainable results in the context 
of the integration; and
– the linear payout between the threshold and maximum levels supports our focus on delivering sustainable performance 
without encouraging excessive risk-taking. 
The rTSR performance metric (50% weighting) over the three-year period further aligns the interests of employees with 
those of shareholders. This metric compares the total shareholder return (the TSR) of UBS with the TSR of an index 
consisting of listed Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs):
– the maximum payout outcome is reached when rTSR is 25 percentage points or more above the index, to mitigate the 
potential for excessive risk-taking; 
– there is zero payout if rTSR is 25 percentage points or more below the index; and
– the linear payout between the threshold and maximum levels further supports appropriate risk-taking
This G-SIBs index is independently determined by the Financial Stability Board (excluding the UBS Group), our index 
includes all publicly traded G-SIBs and reflects companies with a comparable risk profile and impact on the global 
economy. The index is equally weighted, calculated in Swiss francs and maintained by an independent index provider, so 
as to ensure independence of the TSR calculation.

the end of the three-year performance period will vest in three equal installments in each of the three years following 
the performance period for GEB members (i.e., years 3, 4 and 5 after grant) and will cliff-vest for other award recipients 
after the performance period (i.e., year three after grant), although longer deferral periods may apply for regulated GEB 
and other regulated employees.

Performance achievement of the 2020 LTIP granted in 2021
The 2020 LTIP was granted in 2021 (for 2020 performance) at a fair value of 65.9% of a maximum of 100%. The final 
performance achieved is 92.55% of a maximum of 100%. This achievement reflects the outcome of the two equally 
weighted performance metrics, RoCET1 and rTSR, both measured over the three-year performance period from 1 January 
2021 to 31 December 2023. The achievement level of this 2020 LTIP award (granted in 2021) applies to 13 current GEB 
members and 68 other plan participants.
We achieved a three-year average RoCET1 performance of 15.3% against the performance range of 6% to 18%, and 
an rTSR performance of +75.36 percentage points versus the index of listed G-SIBs. 
As explained above, the Compensation Committee made certain adjustments to the financial results used to determine 
the 2020 LTIP achievement level. As noted, if the Compensation Committee had not made these adjustments but had 
applied reported UBS Group AG financial results, i.e., including all acquisition-related effects, the achievement level for 
the RoCET1 metric would have been 100%.
For GEB members, the first of the three equal installments of the 2020 LTIP vests on 28 March 2024 and the second and 
third installments will vest in March 2025 and 2026; while for selected senior management, the 2020 LTIP cliff vests on 
28 March 2024 (later dates may apply for regulated employees). 
Advisory vote | Corporate governance and compensation | Compensation 251
Equity Ownership Plan / Fund Ownership Plan
The Equity Ownership Plan (the EOP) is the deferred compensation plan for employees that are subject to deferral 
requirements but do not receive LTIP awards. For the 2023 performance year, we granted EOP awards to 4,661 
employees. 
Delivering sustainable results is a key objective for UBS. Our EOP creates a direct link with shareholder returns as a notional 
equity award and has no upward leverage. This approach promotes growth and sustainable performance. EOP awards 
generally vest over three years. 
In place of EOP, employees in investment areas within Asset Management receive some or all of their EOP in the form of 
notional funds (the Fund Ownership Plan (the FOP), previously named AM EOP) to align their compensation more closely 
with industry standards. This plan is generally delivered in cash and vests over three years.
› Refer to “Vesting of outstanding awards granted in prior years subject to performance metrics and thresholds” in the 
“Supplemental information” section of this report for more information
Deferred Contingent Capital Plan
The Deferred Contingent Capital Plan (the DCCP) is a key component of our compensation framework and supports 
alignment of the interests of our senior employees with those of our stakeholders.
All employees subject to deferral requirements receive DCCP awards. For the 2023 performance year, we granted DCCP 
awards to 5,562 employees.
The DCCP is consistent with many of the features of the loss-absorbing bonds that we issue to investors and may be paid 
at vesting in cash or, at the discretion of the firm, as a perpetual, marketable additional tier 1 (AT1) capital instrument. 
Employees can elect to have their DCCP awards denominated in Swiss francs or US dollars.
DCCP awards vest in full after five years (longer deferral periods may apply for regulated employees). DCCP awards bear 
notional interest paid annually (except as limited by regulation for MRTs), subject to review and confirmation by the 
Compensation Committee. The notional interest rate for grants in 2024 was 4.6% for awards denominated in Swiss 
francs and 8.3% for awards denominated in US dollars. These interest rates are based on the current market rates for 
similar AT1 capital instruments issued by the UBS Group.
Awards are forfeited if a viability event occurs (i.e., if FINMA notifies the firm that the DCCP awards must be written 
down to mitigate the risk of an insolvency, bankruptcy or failure of UBS) or if the firm receives a commitment of 
extraordinary support from the public sector that is necessary to prevent such an event. DCCP awards are also written 
down for GEB members if the Group’s CET1 capital ratio falls below 10% and for all other employees if it falls below 7%.
In addition, GEB members forfeit 20% of DCCP awards for each loss-making year during the vesting period. This means 
100% of the award is subject to risk of forfeiture. The forfeiture features of DCCP create a strong alignment with our 
debt holders and support the sustainability of the firm.
Over the last five years, USD 1.97bn of DCCP awards have been issued, contributing to the Group’s total loss-absorbing 
capacity (TLAC). Therefore, DCCP awards not only support competitive pay but also provide a loss absorption buffer that 
protects the firm’s capital position. The following table illustrates the contribution of the DCCP to our AT1 capital and 
the effect on our TLAC ratio.

Other variable compensation components
To support hiring and retention, particularly at senior levels, we may offer other compensation components, such as:
– retention payments to key employees to induce them to stay, particularly during critical periods for the firm, such as a 
sale or wind-down of a business;
– on a limited basis, guarantees that may be required to attract individuals with certain skills and experience, these 
awards are fixed incentives subject to our standard deferral rules and limited to the first full year of employment;
– awards granted to employees hired late in the year to replace performance awards that they would have earned at 
their previous employer but have foregone by joining UBS, these awards are generally structured with the same level 
of deferral as for employees at a similar level at UBS; and
– in exceptional cases, sign-on awards may be offered to candidates to increase the chances of them accepting our 
offer.
These other variable compensation components are subject to a comprehensive governance process, which may involve 
the Compensation Committee, depending on the amount or type of such payments.
To support operational stability, manage risks and protect the client franchise, we have deployed specific additional 
measures. Retention awards were delivered in both deferred cash and deferred equity awards. Furthermore, to support 
our client win-back strategy and promote client growth, we also introduced a client acquisition and retention award for 
certain producers, which is fully deferred and the final value is linked to the retention of client assets. Retention efforts 
were targeted and limited to certain client roles and critical roles necessary to support operational stability. Overall, the 
amounts of USD 736m are modest by industry standards for an integration of this magnitude. These retention awards 
account for 3% of our total personnel expenses recognized in 2023.
Employees outside of the GEB that are made redundant may receive severance payments. Our severance terms comply 
with the applicable local laws (legally obligated severance). In certain locations, we may provide severance packages that 
are negotiated with our local social partners and may go beyond the applicable minimum legal requirements (standard 
severance). Such payments are governed by location-specific severance policies. In addition, we may make severance 
payments that exceed legally obligated or standard severance payments where we believe these are aligned with market 
practice and appropriate under the circumstances (supplemental severance). GEB members do not receive severance 
payments.
Replacement awards and forfeitures
In line with industry practice, our compensation framework and plans include provisions generally requiring reduction / 
forfeiture of a terminated employee’s unvested or deferred awards. In particular, these provisions apply if the terminated 
employee joins another financial services organization and / or violates restrictive covenants, such as solicitation of clients 
or employees. 
Conversely, to attract external top talent, market practice dictates that we consider replacing their forfeited compensation 
from their prior employer. In select situations and based on careful consideration, we replace the lost compensation of 
senior hires. The replacement awards are subject to UBS’s harmful acts provisions. Their value is subject to independent 
review as part of the “Report of the statutory auditor on the compensation report” to support the like-for-like nature of 
the replacement and to confirm that these awards do not represent sign-on payments (i.e., there are no “golden hellos”).
Based on a thorough review of available documentation, we aim to mirror the type, conditions and timing of the forfeited 
compensation, based on actual facts and circumstances. Replacement awards can include cash payments and / or 
deferred awards, including EOP share awards and DCCP awards. Where payments are made in cash, there is typically a 
clawback period if the employee leaves UBS voluntarily within 12 months of the start of employment. The replacement 
awards do not exceed the commercial or fair value of the compensation actually forfeited by the individual and, in case 
of GEB members, are disclosed transparently. The total 2023 forfeitures of USD 1,903m of previously awarded deferred 
compensation offset the 2023 total sign-on payments, replacement payments and guarantees of USD 216m.

Employee share ownership
According to available records on employee shareholdings, including unvested deferred compensation, as of 
31 December 2023, employees held at least USD 7.9bn of UBS shares (of which approximately USD 5.3bn were 
unvested), representing approximately 7.4% of our total shares issued.
The Equity Plus Plan is our employee share purchase program. It allows employees at Executive Director level and below 
to voluntarily invest up to 30% of their base salary and / or regular commission payments to purchase UBS shares. In 
addition (where offered), eligible employees can invest up to 35% of their performance award under the program. 
Participation in the program is capped at USD / CHF 20,000 annually. Eligible employees may purchase UBS shares at 
market price and receive one additional share for every three shares purchased through the program. Additional shares 
vest after a maximum of three years, provided the employee remains employed by UBS and has retained the purchased 
shares throughout the holding period.

Compensation for US financial advisors in Global Wealth Management
In line with market practice for US wealth management businesses, the compensation for US financial advisors in Global 
Wealth Management consists of cash compensation and deferred compensation awards, determined using a formulaic 
approach based on production.
The monthly cash compensation is determined using an overall percentage rate for each financial advisor. It reflects a 
percentage of the compensable production that each financial advisor generates during that month. Compensable 
production is generally based on transaction revenue and investment advisory fees and may reflect further adjustments. 
The percentage rate generally varies based on the level of the production and firm tenure, supporting growth and 
alignment with the investment strategy and goals of our clients.
Financial advisors may also be granted annual deferred compensation. These amounts generally vest over a six-year 
period. The annual deferred compensation amount reflects their overall percentage rate and production, as previously 
outlined.
Cash compensation and deferred compensation awards may be reduced for, among other things, errors, negligence or 
carelessness, or failure to comply with the firm’s rules, standards, practices and / or policies, and / or applicable laws and 
regulations.
Financial advisors may also participate in additional programs to support promoting and developing their business or 
supporting the transition of client relationships where appropriate.

The performance award pool, which includes performance-based variable awards for 2023, was USD 4.5bn, reflecting 
an increase of 38% compared with 2022 (or a reduction of 14% compared with the pro forma aggregate 2022 pool of 
USD 5.3bn for the combined entities, which includes the UBS performance award pool, the Credit Suisse variable 
incentive compensation pool and other variable compensation awards related to the 2022 performance year). 
Performance award expenses for 2023 increased to USD 4.0bn, mainly reflecting increased performance award expenses 
accrued in the performance year as a result of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. The “Performance award pool 
and expenses” table below compares the performance award pool with performance award expenses.

Compensation for the Board of Directors
Chairman of the BoD
Under the leadership of the Chairman, Colm Kelleher, the BoD determines, among other things, the strategy for the 
Group, based on recommendations by the Group CEO, exercises ultimate supervision over management and appoints all 
GEB members.
The Chairman leads all general meetings and BoD meetings and works with the committee Chairpersons to coordinate 
the work of all BoD committees. Together with the Group CEO, the Chairman is responsible for effective communication 
with shareholders and stakeholders, including clients, government officials, regulators and public organizations. The 
Chairman works closely with the Group CEO and other GEB members, providing advice and support when appropriate, 
and continues to strengthen and promote our culture through the three keys to success: our Pillars, Principles and 
Behaviors.
As an independent director, the Chairman’s total compensation for the period from Annual General Meeting (AGM) to 
AGM consists of a fixed fee without any variable component, which is delivered 50% in cash and 50% in shares (blocked 
for four years). For the current period, from the 2023 AGM to the 2024 AGM, his fixed fee was CHF 4.7m and consisted 
of a cash payment of CHF 2.35m and a share component of CHF 2.35m, consisting of 96,173 UBS shares at CHF 24.435 
per share. The share component aligns the Chairman’s pay with the Group’s long-term performance. The Chairman does 
not receive performance awards, severance payments or pension contributions in addition to his fixed fee, but, given the 
full-time nature of his role, he is eligible for employee conditions on UBS products and services. Effective from the 2024 
AGM, we will increase the Chairman’s annual fixed fee to CHF 5.5m, to reflect the significantly increased scope, 
responsibility and complexity following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
› Refer to “Board of Directors” in the “Corporate governance” section of this report for more information about the responsibilities 
of the Chairman
Vice Chairman of the BoD
As the Vice Chairman of the BoD, Lukas Gähwiler leads the BoD in the absence of the Chairman and, together with the 
Senior Independent Director, he also supports the Chairman in all aspects of corporate governance and oversight across 
the Group. In particular, he represents UBS across a broad range of associations and industry bodies in Switzerland. In 
2023, Lukas Gähwiler took on additional responsibilities as the chairman of the board of Credit Suisse AG, a subsidiary 
of UBS Group AG. This nomination is critical to provide strong governance and oversight of the subsidiary, in a manner 
consistent and in compliance with UBS Group AG governance principles, and also to facilitate the integration of Credit 
Suisse AG into UBS. 
The Vice Chairman’s total compensation for his services in the UBS Group AG Board for the period from AGM to AGM 
consists of a fixed fee without any variable component, which is delivered 50% in cash and 50% in shares (blocked for 
four years). For the current period, from the 2023 AGM to the 2024 AGM, his fixed fee was CHF 1.5m, excluding benefits 
and pension fund contributions. The fixed fee consisted of a cash payment of CHF 0.75m and a share component of 
CHF 0.75m, consisting of 30,693 UBS shares at CHF 24.435 per share. 
As a non-independent director, Mr. Gähwiler is entitled to pension fund contributions. Including these, his total reward 
for his service as Vice Chairman for the current period was CHF 1,881,368.
Serving in a subsidiary board is a substantial increase in the scope, responsibility and complexity of his mandate and was 
urgently required to support the merger. Therefore, Mr. Gähwiler will be entitled to receive an additional board member 
fee aligned with his role as Chairman of Credit Suisse AG and with other non-executive directors on the respective 
subsidiary entities. The payment of this subsidiary board fee is subject to shareholder approval as part of an incremental 
amount at the 2024 AGM.
The Vice Chairman’s fee for his services in the Credit Suisse AG board for the period from AGM to AGM consists of a 
fixed fee without any variable component, which is delivered 100% in cash. For the current period, from the 2023 AGM 
to the 2024 AGM, his total reward for his services as chairman in the Credit Suisse AG board was CHF 1,000,000.
The Vice Chairman is not eligible for performance awards, severance terms or supplementary contributions to pension 
plans. The pension contributions and benefits for the Vice Chairman, in his capacity as non-independent director, are 
consistent with all UBS employees and aligned with local market practice.
› Refer to “Board of Directors” in the “Corporate governance” section of this report for more information about the responsibilities 
of the Vice Chairman

Advisory vote | Corporate governance and compensation | Compensation 256
Other BoD members
BoD members, except the Chairman and Vice Chairman, receive fixed fees for their services on the BoD and its 
committees. These fees are unchanged from the last AGM-to-AGM period. BoD members do not receive performance 
awards, severance payments, benefits or pension contributions (the benefit eligibility of the Chairman and that of the 
Vice Chairman are described above).
BoD members other than the Chairman and the Vice Chairman must use a minimum of 50% of their fees to purchase 
UBS shares, which are blocked for four years, and they may elect to use up to 100% of their fees to purchase blocked 
UBS shares. The number of shares is calculated based on the average closing price of the 10 trading days leading up to 
and including the grant date.
In 2023, in order to facilitate the integration of Credit Suisse into UBS, two independent BoD members served on the 
boards of directors of subsidiaries. UBS Group AG Board members who have additional roles on the boards of significant 
subsidiary entities receive respective fees for the significant increase in the scope, responsibility and complexity of their 
mandates. These fees are aligned with other non-executive directors of the respective subsidiary entities. The payment 
of these subsidiary board fees is subject to shareholder approval as part of an incremental amount at the 2024 AGM. 
The total remuneration of other UBS Group AG members, including fees from subsidiaries, is summarized in the 
“Remuneration details and additional information for BoD members” table below.
At each AGM, shareholders are invited to approve the aggregate amount of BoD remuneration, including the 
compensation for the Chairman and Vice Chairman, which applies until the next AGM. The chart and the tables below 
provide details on the fee structure for the BoD members.
Approval governance for BoD compensation
The Chairperson of the Compensation Committee proposes and the Compensation Committee approves the 
compensation of the Chairman and that of the Vice Chairman annually for the upcoming AGM-to-AGM period, taking 
into consideration fee or compensation levels for comparable roles based on our core financial industry peers and other 
relevant leading Swiss companies included in the Swiss Market Index.
The fee structure for the other BoD members is reviewed annually based on the Chairman’s proposal to the 
Compensation Committee, which in turn submits a proposal to the BoD for approval. In our regular review of the BoD 
fee structure, we concluded that our overall approach for BoD member compensation remains appropriate and thus 
unchanged.

Regulated staff
Key Risk Takers
Key Risk Takers (KRTs) are defined as those employees that, by the nature of their roles, have been determined to 
materially set, commit or control significant amounts of the firm’s resources and / or exert significant influence over its 
risk profile. This includes employees working in front-office roles, logistics and control functions. Identifying KRTs globally 
is part of our risk control framework and an important element in ensuring we incentivize only appropriate risk-taking. 
For 2023, in addition to GEB members, 1,038 employees were classified as KRTs throughout the UBS Group globally, 
including all employees with a total compensation exceeding USD / CHF 2.5m (Highly Paid Employees), who may not 
have been identified as KRTs during the performance year. Compared with 2022, the increase in the number of KRTs 
has been driven by the inclusion of Credit Suisse employees in the identification process.
In line with regulatory requirements, the performance of employees identified as KRTs during the performance year is 
evaluated by the control functions. In addition, KRTs’ performance awards are subject to a mandatory deferral rate of at 
least 50%, regardless of whether the deferral threshold has been met (excluding KRTs with de minimis performance 
awards below a predetermined threshold where standard deferral rates apply). Consistent with all other employees, the 
deferred portion of a KRT’s compensation is also subject to forfeiture or reduction if the KRT commits harmful acts.

reinvestments. 2 Refer to “Note 27 Employee benefits: variable compensation” in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report for more information. 3 GEB members and KRTs who are also 
MRTs do not receive dividend and interest payments. Accordingly, the amounts for the EOP / LTIP reflect the fair value of the non-dividend-bearing awards and for the DCCP the fair value of the granted non-interestbearing awards. 4 Where applicable, amounts are translated into US dollars at the performance award currency exchange rate. LTIP values reflect the fair value awarded at grant. 5 Takes into account the ex post

in the 2023 financial year for GEB members and KRTs.
Ex post adjustments occur after an award has been granted. Explicit adjustments occur when we adjust compensation 
by forfeiting deferred awards. Implicit adjustments are unrelated to any action taken by the firm and occur as a result of 
price movements that affect the value of an award.

1 For notional share awards (excluding Credit Suisse legacy plan awards), ex post explicit adjustments are calculated as units forfeited during the year, valued at the share price on 31 December 2023 (USD 30.9) for 
2023 (which may differ from the expense recognized in the income statement in accordance with IFRS). The 2022 data is valued using the share price on 31 December 2022 (USD 18.67). For LTIP, the forfeited units 
reflect the fair value awarded at grant. For the notional funds awarded to employees in investment areas within Asset Management under the FOP, this represents the forfeiture credits recognized in 2023 and 2022. 
For DCCP, the fair value at grant of the forfeited awards during the year is reflected. Credit Suisse legacy plan awards (including Credit Suisse notional fund awards) are calculated using value at grant and include the 
explicit adjustments resulting from the cancellation and reduction order issued by the Federal Department of Finance (FDF) of Switzerland. The 2022 data excludes Credit Suisse legacy award forfeitures. All values 
shown exclude DCCP interest and CCA coupon forfeitures. 2 Ex post implicit adjustments for UBS shares are calculated based on the difference between the weighted average grant date fair value and the share 
price at year-end while Credit Suisse legacy plans are calculated based on comparing the value at 31 December 2023 to the value at 31 December 2022. The amount for UBS notional funds is calculated using the 
mark-to-market change during 2023 and 2022. The 2022 data excludes implicit adjustments related to the Credit Suisse legacy awards. For the GEB members who were appointed to the GEB during 2023, awards 
have been fully reflected in the GEB categories.

Material Risk Takers
For relevant EU- or UK-regulated entities, we identify individuals who are deemed to be Material Risk Takers (MRTs) based 
on sectorial and / or local regulatory requirements, including the respective EU Commission Delegated Regulation, the 
fifth iteration of the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD V) and equivalent UK requirements, as applicable. This group 
consists of senior management, risk takers, selected staff in control or support functions and certain highly compensated 
employees. For 2023, UBS identified 1,321 MRTs in relation to its relevant EU or UK entities. The increase in the number 
of MRTs compared with last year has been driven by the MRT population identified in relation to Credit Suisse legal 
entities.
Subject to individual or legal-entity level proportionality considerations, variable compensation awarded to MRTs is subject 
to additional deferral and other requirements. For CRD-relevant entities, these include a minimum deferral rate of 40% or 
60% (depending on role / variable compensation level) on performance awards and delivery of at least 50% of any upfront 
performance award in UBS shares that are vested but blocked for 12 months after grant. Deferred awards granted to MRTs 
under UBS’s deferred compensation plans for their performance in 2023 are subject to 6- or 12-month blocking periods 
post vesting and do not pay out dividends or interest during the deferral period.
Additionally, MRTs are subject to a maximum ratio between fixed and variable pay. Across EU locations, the maximum 
variable to fixed compensation ratio is set to 200%, based on approval through relevant shareholder votes. 
For UK-regulated MRTs, the maximum ratio was set by UBS taking into account the business activities and prudential and 
conduct risks of the relevant legal entities. In addition, the maximum ratios were set considering the scenario that the 
relevant legal entities might exceed their financial objectives.
The maximum ratio for all UK-regulated MRTs was approved by the compensation committees of the relevant entities in 
December 2023.
For up to seven years after grant, performance awards granted to MRTs are subject to clawback provisions, which allow 
the firm to claim repayment of both the upfront and the vested deferred element of any performance award if an 
individual is found to have contributed substantially to significant financial losses for the Group or corporate structure in 
scope, a material downward restatement of disclosed results, or engaged in misconduct and / or failed to take expected 
actions, thus contributing to significant reputational harm.
LTIP awards granted to UK MRTs and SMFs are subject to an additional non-financial conduct-related metric as required 
by UK regulation.
UK Senior Managers and Certification Regime
The Senior Managers and Certification Regime (the SMCR) of the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial 
Conduct Authority requires that individuals with specified responsibilities, performing certain significant functions and / 
or those in certain other identified categories be designated as SMFs.
Subject to de minimis and other compensation-related considerations, variable compensation awards made to SMFs must 
comply with specific requirements, including longer deferral, blocking and clawback periods. The deferral period for SMFs 
is seven years, with the deferred performance awards vesting no faster than pro rata from years 3 to 7, except those that 
have total compensation below GBP 500,000 and variable incentive accounting for less than 33% of total compensation, 
for whom a five-year deferral period (instead of a seven-year period) applies. Such awards are also subject to a 12-month 
blocking period post vesting. The clawback policy for SMFs permits clawback for up to 10 years from the date of 
performance award grants (applicable if an individual is subject to an investigation at the end of the initial seven-year 
clawback period). All SMFs are also MRTs and, as such, subject to the same prohibitions on dividend and interest payments.
Control functions and Group Internal Audit
Our control functions must be independent in order to monitor risk effectively. Therefore, their compensation is 
determined separately from the revenue areas that they oversee, supervise or monitor. Their performance award pool is 
based not on the performance of these businesses, but on the performance of the Group as a whole. We also consider 
other factors, such as how effectively the function has performed and our market position. Decisions on individual 
compensation for the senior managers of the control functions are made by the function heads and approved by the 
Group CEO. Decisions on individual compensation for the members of Group Internal Audit (GIA) are made by the Head 
GIA and approved by the Chairman. Following a proposal by the Chairman, total compensation for the Head GIA is 
approved by the Compensation Committee.

2023 Group personnel expenses
The number of personnel employed as of 31 December 2023 increased by 40,241 to 112,842 (full-time equivalents) 
compared with 31 December 2022.
The table below shows our total personnel expenses for 2023, including salaries, pension expenses, social security 
contributions, variable compensation and other personnel costs. Variable compensation includes cash performance 
awards paid in 2024 for the 2023 performance year, amortization of unvested deferred awards granted in previous years 
and the cost of deferred awards granted to employees that are eligible for retirement in the context of the compensation 
framework at the date of grant.
The performance award pool reflects the value of performance awards granted relating to the 2023 performance year, 
including awards that are paid out immediately and those that are deferred. To determine our variable compensation 
expenses, the following adjustments are required in order to reconcile the performance award pool to the expenses 
recognized in the Group’s Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards:
– a reduction for expenses deferred to future periods (amortization of unvested awards granted in 2024 for the 2023 
performance year) and accounting adjustments; and 
– an addition for the 2023 amortization of unvested deferred awards granted in prior years.
As a large part of compensation consists of deferred awards, the amortization of unvested deferred awards granted in 
prior years forms a significant part of the IFRS Accounting Standards expenses in both 2023 and 2024. The expenses 
related to prior performance years and total expenses recognized in 2023 include deferred compensation granted under 
Credit Suisse Group compensation plans in previous years, which have to be expensed from 2023 onward due to the 
integration of Credit Suisse into UBS.

Vesting of outstanding awards granted in prior years subject to performance metrics and thresholds
The tables below show the extent to which the performance metrics and thresholds for awards granted in prior years 
have been met and the related vesting in 2024.

Performance metrics Performance achievement1 Vesting
Return on common equity tier 1 capital 
(RoCET1) and relative Total Shareholder

The overall achievement level is 98% of 
the maximum opportunity (of up to 
100%), based on outcomes for rTSR 
(weighted 50%) and RoCET1 (weighted 
50%).
– For GEB, the first and second installments vested in 2023 and 
2024, respectively, and the remaining tranche will vest in 2025 
accordingly. As outlined in our 2019 Compensation Report, up to 
CHF 7.3m, or 30%, of the 2019 LTIP awards at grant for GEB 
members active in March 2017 continues to be at risk and directly 
linked to the final resolution of the French cross-border matter. 
– For other select senior management, the full award vested in 
2023.
1 As disclosed in our Compensation Report 2019, LTIP awards for the 2019 performance year were awarded at a value of 62.25% of maximum, which reflected our best estimate of the fair value of the award. The 
maximum number of shares was determined by dividing the awarded amount by the fair value of the award at the date of grant, divided by CHF 12.919 or USD 13.141, the average closing price of UBS shares over 
the last ten trading days leading up to and including the grant date.

tranches will vest in 2025 and 2026 accordingly.
– For other select senior management, the full award will vest in 
2024.
1 As disclosed in our Compensation Report 2020, LTIP awards for the 2020 performance year were awarded at a value of 65.90% of maximum, which reflected our best estimate of the fair value of the award. The 
maximum number of shares was determined by dividing the awarded amount by the fair value of the award at the date of grant, divided by CHF 13.89 or USD 15.411, the average closing price of UBS shares over 
the last ten trading days leading up to and including the grant date.

Advisory vote | Corporate governance and compensation | Compensation 269
Provisions of the Articles of Association related to compensation
Swiss say-on-pay provisions give shareholders of companies listed in Switzerland significant influence over board and 
management compensation. At UBS, this is achieved by means of an annual binding say-on-pay vote in accordance with 
the following provisions of the AoA.
Say on pay 
In line with article 43 of the AoA, the General Meeting approves proposals from the BoD in relation to:
a) the maximum aggregate amount of compensation of the BoD for the period until the next AGM;
b) the maximum aggregate amount of fixed compensation of the GEB for the following financial year; and
c) the aggregate amount of variable compensation of the GEB for the preceding financial year.
The BoD may submit for approval by the General Meeting deviating or additional proposals relating to the same or 
different periods. If the General Meeting does not approve a proposal from the BoD, the BoD will determine, taking into 
account all relevant factors, the respective (maximum) aggregate amount or (maximum) partial amounts and submit the 
amount(s) so determined for approval by the General Meeting. UBS Group AG or companies controlled by it may pay or 
grant compensation prior to approval by the General Meeting, subject to subsequent approval.
Principles of compensation
In line with articles 45 and 46 of the AoA, compensation of the members of the BoD includes base remuneration and 
may include other compensation elements and benefits. Compensation of the members of the BoD is intended to 
recognize the responsibility and governance nature of their role, to attract and retain qualified individuals, and to ensure 
alignment with shareholders’ interests. 
Compensation of the members of the GEB includes fixed and variable compensation elements. Fixed compensation 
includes the base salary and may include other compensation elements and benefits. Variable compensation elements 
are governed by financial and non-financial performance measures that take into account the performance of UBS Group 
AG and / or parts thereof, targets in relation to the market, other companies or comparable benchmarks, short- and 
long-term strategic objectives, and / or individual targets. The BoD or, where delegated to it, the Compensation 
Committee, determines the respective performance measures, the overall and individual performance targets, and their 
achievement. The BoD or, where delegated to it, the Compensation Committee, aims to ensure alignment with 
sustainable performance and appropriate risk-taking through adequate deferrals, forfeiture conditions, caps on 
compensation, harmful acts provisions and similar means with regard to parts of or all of the compensation. Parts of 
variable compensation are subject to a multi-year vesting period.
Additional amount for GEB members appointed after the vote on the aggregate amount of compensation by the AGM
In line with article 46 of the AoA of UBS Group AG, if the maximum aggregate amount of compensation already approved 
by the General Meeting is not sufficient to also cover the compensation of a person that becomes a member of or is 
being promoted within the GEB after the General Meeting has approved the compensation, UBS Group AG, or companies 
controlled by it, is authorized to pay or grant each such GEB member a supplementary amount during the compensation 
period(s) already approved. The aggregate pool for such supplementary amounts per compensation period cannot exceed 
40% of the average of total annual compensation paid or granted to the GEB during the previous three years.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting
Management’s responsibility for internal control over financial reporting
The Board of Directors and management of UBS Group AG (UBS) are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting. UBS’s internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance 
with IFRS Accounting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). UBS’s internal control 
over financial reporting include those policies and procedures that:
UBS’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
– pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and 
dispositions of assets;
– provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation and fair presentation 
of financial statements, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of UBS management; and
– provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition 
of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate 
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023
UBS management has assessed the effectiveness of UBS’s internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023 
based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of 
31 December 2023, UBS’s internal controls over financial reporting were effective. Management has excluded Credit Suisse, 
which UBS acquired in 2023, from the scope of its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, as permitted by 
SEC guidance for acquired businesses. The total assets of Credit Suisse as of 31 December 2023 represented approximately 
34% of UBS total assets as of such date, and revenues associated with Credit Suisse for the period from acquisition to 
31 December 2023 represented approximately 19% of UBS revenues for the year ended 31 December 2023. 
Credit Suisse material weaknesses
A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that 
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a registrant’s financial statements will not be prevented 
or detected on a timely basis.
Prior to the acquisition by UBS, Credit Suisse Group AG and Credit Suisse AG had each identified certain material 
weaknesses in their internal controls over financial reporting, as a result of which they had concluded that, as of 
31 December 2022, Credit Suisse Group’s and Credit Suisse AG’s internal controls over financial reporting were not 
effective and, for the same reasons, had reached the same conclusion regarding the situation as of 31 December 2021. 
The material weaknesses identified related to the failure to design and maintain an effective risk assessment process to 
identify and analyze the risk of material misstatements in Credit Suisse financial statements and the failure to design and 
maintain effective monitoring activities relating to (i) providing sufficient management oversight over the internal control 
evaluation process to support the company’s internal control objectives; (ii) involving appropriate and sufficient 
management resources to support the risk assessment and monitoring objectives; and (iii) assessing and communicating 
the severity of deficiencies in a timely manner to those parties responsible for taking corrective action. These material 
weaknesses contributed to an additional material weakness, as the Credit Suisse Group management did not design and 
maintain effective controls over the classification and presentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows under US 
GAAP. Specifically, certain control activities over the completeness and the classification and presentation of non-cash 
items in the consolidated statement of cash flows were not performed on a timely basis or at the appropriate level of 
precision. This material weakness resulted in the revisions to Credit Suisse Group’s consolidated financial statements for 
the three years ended 31 December 2021, as disclosed in its 2021 Annual Report.

integration of Credit Suisse” section of this report for additional information about the material weaknesses at Credit Suisse
The effectiveness of UBS’s internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023 has been audited by Ernst & 
Young Ltd, UBS’s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their Report of the independent registered 
public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the 
effectiveness of UBS’s internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2023.

Ordinary share capital
As of 31 December 2023, UBS Group AG had 3,462,087,722 issued shares (31 December 2022: 3,524,635,722 shares). 
In the second quarter of 2023, the share capital currency of UBS Group AG was changed from the Swiss franc to the 
US dollar, as approved by shareholders at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (the AGM). As a result, the nominal value 
per share has changed from CHF 0.10 to USD 0.10, resulting in a reclassification between share capital and capital 
contribution reserve (presented as share premium in the consolidated financial statements) and leading to a share capital 
of USD 346,208,772.20. Shares issued decreased by 62,548,000 shares and share capital decreased by USD 7m in 2023, 
as the shares acquired under the 2021 share repurchase program were canceled by means of a capital reduction, as 
approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM.
Conditional share capital
As of 31 December 2023, the following conditional share capital was available to the Board of Directors (the BoD) of 
UBS Group AG.

of USD 0.10 each, to be issued through the voluntary or mandatory exercise of conversion rights and / or warrants 
granted in connection with the issuance of bonds or similar financial instruments by UBS Group AG or another member 
of the Group on national or international capital markets. This conditional capital allowance was approved at the 
Extraordinary General Meeting (the EGM) held on 26 November 2014, having originally been approved at the AGM 
of UBS AG on 14 April 2010. The BoD has not made use of such allowance.
– A maximum of USD 12,170,583 represented by 121,705,830 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of 
USD 0.10 each, to be issued upon exercise of employee options and stock appreciation rights issued to employees and 
members of the management and of the BoD of UBS Group AG and its subsidiaries. This conditional capital allowance 
was approved by the shareholders at the same EGM in 2014.

capital.

Share repurchase programs
In February 2021, UBS initiated a share repurchase program of up to CHF 4bn which concluded on 29 March 2022. A 
total of 177,787,273 shares repurchased under this program for a total acquisition cost of USD 3,022m (CHF 2,775m) 
were canceled by means of a capital reduction in 2022, as approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM. Remaining 
62,548,000 shares purchased under the 2021 program for a total acquisition cost of USD 1,115m (CHF 1,035m) were 
canceled by means of a capital reduction in the second quarter of 2023, as approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM.
In March 2022, UBS commenced a new two-year share repurchase program of up to USD 6bn. Under this program, UBS 
repurchased 64.6m shares in 2023 for a total acquisition cost of USD 1,300m (CHF 1,202m). A total of 178m shares 
repurchased under the 2022 program and originally intended for cancellation purposes were repurposed for the 
acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group and 176m shares were transferred to Credit Suisse Group shareholders in an 
exchange of shares as consideration for the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. UBS also intends to cancel the 
remaining shares purchased under the 2022 program by means of a capital reduction, pending approval by shareholders 
at a future AGM.
A new, two-year share repurchase program of up to USD 6bn was approved by shareholders at the 2023 AGM. However, 
repurchases under the share repurchase programs were temporarily suspended due to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse 
Group.

Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
a) Material accounting policies
This Note describes the material accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
(the Financial Statements) of UBS Group AG and its subsidiaries (UBS or the Group). On 21 March 2024, the Financial 
Statements were authorized for issue by the UBS Group AG Board of Directors (the BoD). 
Basis of accounting
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (the IASB), and are presented in US dollars.
Disclosures marked as audited in the “Risk, capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet” section of this report form 
an integral part of the Financial Statements. These disclosures relate to requirements under IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures, and IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, and are not repeated in this section. 
The accounting policies described in this Note have been applied consistently in all years presented unless otherwise 
stated in Note 1b. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
Preparation of these Financial Statements under IFRS Accounting Standards requires management to apply judgment and make estimates and assumptions that 
affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and may involve significant uncertainty at the 
time they are made. Such estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information. UBS regularly reassesses such estimates and assumptions, which 
encompass historical experience, expectations of the future and other pertinent factors, to determine their continuing relevance based on current conditions, 
updating them as necessary. Changes in those estimates and assumptions may have a significant effect on the Financial Statements. Furthermore, actual results 
may differ significantly from UBS’s estimates, which could result in significant losses to the Group, beyond what was anticipated or provided for. 
The following areas contain estimation uncertainty or require critical judgment and have a significant effect on amounts recognized in the Financial 
Statements:
– provisional amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group (refer to item 1 in this Note and 
to Note 2);
– expected credit loss measurement (refer to item 2g in this Note and to Note 20);
– fair value measurement (refer to item 2f in this Note and to Note 21);
– income taxes (refer to item 6 in this Note and to Note 9);
– provisions and contingent liabilities (refer to item 10 in this Note and to Note 18);
– post-employment benefit plans (refer to item 5 in this Note and to Note 27);
– goodwill (refer to item 9 in this Note and to Note 13); and
– consolidation of structured entities (refer to item 1 in this Note and to Note 29). 
1) Consolidation and business combinations
Consolidation
The Financial Statements include the financial statements of the parent company (UBS Group AG) and its subsidiaries, 
presented as a single economic entity; intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. UBS consolidates 
all entities that it controls, including structured entities (SEs), which is the case when it has: (i) power over the relevant 
activities of the entity; (ii) exposure to the entity‘s variable returns; and (iii) the ability to use its power to affect its own 
returns.
Consideration is given to all facts and circumstances to determine whether the Group has power over another entity, 
i.e., the current ability to direct the relevant activities of an entity when decisions about those activities need to be made. 
Subsidiaries, including SEs, are consolidated from the date when control is gained and deconsolidated from the date 
when control ceases. Control, or the lack thereof, is reassessed if facts and circumstances indicate that there is a change 
to one or more elements required to establish that control is present.
› Refer to Note 29 for more information
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
Each individual entity is assessed for consolidation in line with the aforementioned consolidation principles. The assessment of control can be complex and 
requires the use of significant judgment, in particular in determining whether UBS has power over the entity. As the nature and extent of UBS’s involvement 
is unique for each entity, there is no uniform consolidation outcome by entity. Certain entities within a class may be consolidated while others may not. 
When carrying out the consolidation assessment, judgment is exercised considering all the relevant facts and circumstances, including the nature and activities 
of the investee, as well as the substance of voting and similar rights. 
› Refer to Note 29 for more information
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 293
Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, as prescribed by IFRS 3, Business Combinations. 
Under this method, any excess of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable net assets acquired over the fair value 
of the consideration transferred results in negative goodwill that is recognized in the income statement on the date of 
the acquisition, with transaction costs expensed as incurred. Provisional amounts of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities 
assumed and purchase consideration determined as of the acquisition date may be subject to adjustments within a 
maximum of one year from the acquisition date (referred to in this report as measurement period adjustments). 
The amount of non-controlling interests, if any, is measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the 
acquiree’s identifiable net assets. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
When complete information about all relevant facts and circumstances of the acquisition date is not practically available to UBS at the time when the initial 
acquisition accounting was applied in the period of acquisition, the amounts that form part of the business combination accounting are considered provisional 
and subject to further measurement period adjustments if new information about facts and circumstances existing on the date of the acquisition is obtained 
within one year from the acquisition date. In addition, the use of valuation techniques, modeling assumptions and estimates of unobservable market inputs 
in determining fair values require significant judgment and could affect the provisional amounts of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and 
purchase consideration, thereby affecting the resulting goodwill / negative goodwill arising from the business combination. 
› Refer to Note 2 for more information relating to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group
2) Financial instruments
a. Recognition
UBS generally recognizes financial instruments when it becomes a party to contractual provisions of an instrument.
However, UBS does not recognize assets received in transfers that do not qualify for derecognition by the transferor 
(applying derecognition principles under IFRS Accounting Standards as described in item 2e below). UBS applies 
settlement date accounting to all standard purchases and sales of non-derivative financial instruments. 
UBS may act in a fiduciary capacity, which results in it holding or placing assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement 
benefit plans and other institutions. Unless these items meet the definition of an asset and the recognition criteria are 
satisfied, they are not recognized on UBS’s balance sheet and the related income is excluded from the Financial 
Statements. 
Client cash balances associated with derivatives clearing and execution services are not recognized on the balance sheet 
if, through contractual agreement, regulation or practice, UBS neither obtains benefits from nor controls such cash 
balances.
b. Classification, measurement and presentation
Financial assets 
Where the contractual terms of a debt instrument result in cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest 
(SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding, the debt instrument is classified as measured at amortized cost if it is held 
within a business model that has an objective of holding financial assets to collect contractual cash flows, or at fair value 
through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) if it is held within a business model with the objective of both collecting 
contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. 
All other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), including those held for trading or 
those managed on a fair value basis, except for derivatives designated in certain hedge accounting relationships (refer to 
item 2j in this Note for more information). 
Business model assessment and contractual cash flow characteristics 
UBS determines the nature of a business model by considering the way financial assets are managed to achieve a 
particular business objective at the time an asset is recognized. 
In assessing whether contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Group considers whether the contractual terms of the financial 
asset contain a term that could change the timing or amount of contractual cash flows arising over the life of the 
instrument. This assessment includes contractual cash flows that may vary due to environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) triggers.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 294
Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Financial liabilities 
Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost 
Debt issued measured at amortized cost includes contingent capital instruments issued prior to November 2023 that 
contain contractual provisions under which the principal amounts would be written down upon either a specified 
common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio breach or a determination by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) 
that a viability event has occurred. Such contractual provisions are not derivatives, as the underlying is deemed to be a 
non-financial variable specific to a party to the contract. Issuances after November 2023 include a contractual equity 
conversion feature with the same triggers, i.e., a CET1 ratio breach or FINMA viability event. When the debt is issued in 
US dollars, these conversion features are classified as equity and are accounted for in Share premium separately from the 
amortized cost debt host.
When the legal bail-in mechanism for write-down or conversion into equity does not form part of the contractual terms 
of issued debt instruments, it does not affect the accounting classification of these instruments as debt or equity.
If a debt were to be written down or converted into equity in a future period, it would be partially or fully derecognized, 
with the difference between its carrying amount and the fair value of any equity issued recognized in the income 
statement. 
Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss 
UBS designates certain issued debt instruments as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, on the basis that 
such financial instruments include embedded derivatives that are not closely related and which significantly impact the 
cash flows of the instrument and / or are managed on a fair value basis (refer to the table below for more information). 
Financial instruments including embedded derivatives arise predominantly from the issuance of certain structured debt 
instruments. 
Measurement and presentation 
After initial recognition, UBS classifies, measures and presents its financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IFRS 9, 
as described in the table below. 
Classification, measurement and presentation of financial assets 
Financial assets classification Significant items included Measurement and presentation
Measured at 
amortized cost
This classification includes:
– cash and balances at central banks;
– amounts due from banks;
– receivables from securities financing transactions;
– cash collateral receivables on derivative 
instruments;
– residential and commercial mortgages;
– corporate loans;
– secured loans, including Lombard loans, and 
unsecured loans;
– loans to financial advisors; and
– debt securities held as high-quality liquid assets 
(HQLA). 
Measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method less allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) 
(refer to items 2d and 2g in this Note for more information).
The following items are recognized in the income 
statement:
– interest income, which is accounted for in accordance 
with item 2d in this Note;
– ECL and reversals; and
– foreign exchange (FX) translation gains and losses.
When a financial asset at amortized cost is derecognized, 
the gain or loss is recognized in the income statement.
For amounts arising from settlement of certain derivatives, 
see below in this table. 
Measured at 
FVOCI 
Debt 
instruments 
measured at 
FVOCI
This classification primarily includes debt securities 
held as HQLA.
Measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses 
reported in Other comprehensive income, net of applicable 
income taxes, until such investments are derecognized. 
Upon derecognition, any accumulated balances in Other 
comprehensive income are reclassified to the income 
statement and reported within Other income.
The following items, which are determined on the same 
basis as for financial assets measured at amortized cost, are 
recognized in the income statement:
– interest income, which is accounted for in accordance 
with item 2d in this Note;
– ECL and reversals; and
– FX translation gains and losses.

Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Classification, measurement and presentation of financial assets
Financial assets classification Significant items included Measurement and presentation
Held for 
trading
Financial assets held for trading include:
– all derivatives with a positive replacement value, except 
those that are designated and effective hedging 
instruments; and
– other financial assets acquired principally for the 
purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term, or 
that are part of a portfolio of identified financial 
instruments that are managed together and for which 
there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of shortterm profit taking. Included in this category are debt 
instruments (including those in the form of securities, 
money market paper, and traded corporate and bank 
loans) and equity instruments. 
Measured at 
FVTPL
Mandatorily 
measured at 
FVTPL – Other
Financial assets mandatorily measured at FVTPL that are 
not held for trading include: 
– certain structured instruments, certain commercial 
loans, and receivables from securities financing 
transactions that are managed on a fair value basis; 
– loans managed on a fair value basis, including those 
hedged with credit derivatives;
– certain debt securities held as HQLA and managed on a 
fair value basis; 
– certain investment fund holdings and assets held to 
hedge delivery obligations related to cash-settled 
employee compensation plans; 
– brokerage receivables, for which contractual cash flows 
do not meet the SPPI criterion because the aggregate 
balance is accounted for as a single unit of account, 
with interest being calculated on the individual 
components;
– auction rate securities, for which contractual cash flows 
do not meet the SPPI criterion because interest may be 
reset at rates that contain leverage;
– equity instruments; and
– assets held under unit-linked investment contracts.
Measured at fair value, with changes recognized in the 
income statement.
Derivative assets (including derivatives that are designated 
and effective hedging instruments) are generally 
presented as Derivative financial instruments, except those 
exchange-traded derivatives (ETD) and over-the-counter 
(OTC)-cleared derivatives that are legally settled on a daily 
basis or economically net settled on a daily basis, which 
are presented within Cash collateral receivables on 
derivative instruments.
Changes in fair value, initial transaction costs, dividends 
and gains and losses arising on disposal or redemption are 
recognized in Other net income from financial 
instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
except interest income on instruments other than 
derivatives (refer to item 2d in this Note), interest on 
derivatives designated as hedging instruments in hedges 
of interest rate risk and forward points on certain shortand long-duration FX contracts acting as economic 
hedges, which are reported in Net interest income. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are 
designated and effective hedging instruments are 
presented either in the income statement or Other 
comprehensive income, depending on the type of hedge 
relationship (refer to item 2j in this Note for more 
information).

Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Classification, measurement and presentation of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities classification Significant items included Measurement and presentation
Measured at amortized cost This classification includes:
– demand and time deposits; 
– retail savings / deposits;
– sweep deposits;
– payables from securities financing transactions; 
– non-structured debt issued; 
– subordinated debt; 
– commercial paper and certificates of deposit; and
– cash collateral payables on derivative instruments.
Measured at amortized cost using the effective interest 
method.
When a financial liability at amortized cost is 
derecognized, the gain or loss is recognized in the income 
statement. 
Interest income generated from client deposits 
derecognized pursuant to certain deposit sweep programs 
is presented within Net interest income from financial 
instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss 
and other.
Held for trading Financial liabilities held for trading include:
– all derivatives with a negative replacement value 
(including certain loan commitments), except those 
that are designated and effective hedging 
instruments; and
– obligations to deliver financial instruments, such as 
debt and equity instruments, that UBS has sold to 
third parties but does not own (short positions).
Measured at 
FVTPL
Designated at 
FVTPL
Financial liabilities designated at FVTPL include:
– issued hybrid debt instruments, primarily equitylinked, credit-linked and rates-linked bonds or notes;
– issued debt instruments managed on a fair value 
basis;
– certain payables from securities financing 
transactions;
– amounts due under unit-linked investment contracts, 
the cash flows of which are linked to financial assets 
measured at FVTPL and eliminate an accounting 
mismatch; and
– brokerage payables, which arise in conjunction with 
brokerage receivables and are measured at FVTPL to 
achieve measurement consistency.
Measurement and presentation of financial liabilities 
classified at FVTPL follow the same principles as for 
financial assets classified at FVTPL, except that the amount 
of change in the fair value of a financial liability 
designated at FVTPL that is attributable to changes in 
UBS’s own credit risk is presented in Other comprehensive 
income directly within Retained earnings and is never 
reclassified to the income statement.
Derivative liabilities (including derivatives that are 
designated and effective hedging instruments) are 
generally presented as Derivative financial instruments, 
except those exchange-traded and OTC-cleared 
derivatives that are legally settled on a daily basis or 
economically net settled on a daily basis, which are 
presented within Cash collateral payables on derivative 
instruments.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 297
Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
c. Loan commitments and financial guarantees
Loan commitments are arrangements to provide credit under defined terms and conditions. Irrevocable loan 
commitments are classified as: (i) derivative loan commitments measured at fair value through profit or loss; (ii) loan 
commitments designated at fair value through profit or loss; or (iii) loan commitments not measured at fair value. 
Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require UBS to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for an 
incurred loss because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a specified 
debt instrument.
d. Interest income and expense
Interest income and expense are recognized in the income statement based on the effective interest method. When 
calculating the effective interest rate (the EIR) for financial instruments (other than credit-impaired financial instruments), 
UBS estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the instrument, but not expected credit losses, with 
the EIR applied to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or the amortized cost of a financial liability. However, 
when a financial asset becomes credit impaired after initial recognition, interest income is determined by applying the 
EIR to the amortized cost of the instrument, which represents the gross carrying amount adjusted for any credit loss 
allowance. 
Upfront fees, including fees on loan commitments not measured at fair value where a loan is expected to be issued, and 
direct costs are included within the initial measurement of a financial instrument measured at amortized cost or FVOCI 
and recognized over the expected life of the instrument as part of its EIR.
Fees related to loan commitments where no loan is expected to be issued, as well as loan syndication fees where UBS 
does not retain a portion of the syndicated loan or where UBS does retain a portion of the syndicated loan at the same 
effective yield for comparable risk as other participants, are included in Net fee and commission income and either 
recognized over the life of the commitment or when syndication occurs. 
› Refer to item 3 in this Note for more information
Interest income on financial assets, excluding derivatives, is included in interest income when positive and in interest 
expense when negative. Similarly, interest expense on financial liabilities, excluding derivatives, is included in interest 
expense, except when interest rates are negative, in which case it is included in interest income. 
› Refer to item 2b in this Note and Note 4 for more information
e. Derecognition 
Financial assets
UBS derecognizes a transferred financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, if the purchaser has obtained substantially 
all the risks and rewards of the asset or a significant part of the risks and rewards combined with a practical ability to sell 
or pledge the asset. 
Where financial assets have been pledged as collateral or in similar arrangements, they are considered to have been 
transferred if the counterparty has received the contractual rights to the cash flows of the pledged assets, as may be 
evidenced by, for example, the counterparty’s right to sell or repledge the assets. In transfers where control over the 
financial asset is retained, UBS continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement, determined 
by the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset following the transfer. 
› Refer to Note 23 for more information 
Financial liabilities
UBS derecognizes a financial liability when it is extinguished, i.e., when the obligation specified in the contract is 
discharged, canceled or expires. When an existing financial liability is exchanged for a new one from the same lender on 
substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, the original liability is 
derecognized and a new liability recognized with any difference in the respective carrying amounts recorded in the 
income statement. 
Certain OTC derivative contracts and most exchange-traded futures and option contracts cleared through central clearing 
counterparties and exchanges are considered to be settled on a daily basis, as the payment or receipt of a variation 
margin on a daily basis represents a legal or economic settlement, which results in derecognition of the associated 
derivatives.
› Refer to Note 22 for more information 
f. Fair value of financial instruments
UBS accounts for a significant portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is the price on the measurement 
date that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants in the principal market, or in the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market. 
› Refer to Note 21 for more information
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 298
Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The use of valuation techniques, modeling assumptions and estimates of unobservable market inputs in the fair valuation of financial instruments requires 
significant judgment and could affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Valuation techniques that rely more heavily on 
unobservable inputs and sophisticated models inherently require a higher level of judgment and may require adjustment to reflect factors that market 
participants would consider in estimating fair value, such as close-out costs, which are presented in Note 21d. 
UBS‘s governance framework over fair value measurement is described in Note 21b, and UBS provides a sensitivity analysis of the estimated effects arising 
from changing significant unobservable inputs in Level 3 financial instruments to reasonably possible alternative assumptions in Note 21f.

Refer to Note 21 for more information
g. Allowances and provisions for expected credit losses
ECL are recognized for financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets measured at FVOCI, fee and lease 
receivables, financial guarantees, and loan commitments not measured at fair value. ECL are also recognized on the 
undrawn portion of committed unconditionally revocable credit lines, which include UBS’s credit card limits and master 
credit facilities, as UBS is exposed to credit risk because the borrower has the ability to draw down funds before UBS can 
take credit risk mitigation actions.
Recognition of expected credit losses 
ECL are recognized on the following basis.
– Stage 1 instruments: Maximum 12-month ECL are recognized from initial recognition, reflecting the portion of lifetime 
ECL that would result if a default occurs in the 12 months after the reporting date, weighted by the risk of a default 
occurring. 
– Stage 2 instruments: Lifetime ECL are recognized if a significant increase in credit risk (an SICR) is observed subsequent 
to the instrument’s initial recognition, reflecting lifetime cash shortfalls that would result from all possible default 
events over the expected life of a financial instrument, weighted by the risk of a default occurring. When an SICR is 
no longer observed, the instrument will move back to stage 1.
– Stage 3 instruments: Lifetime ECL are always recognized for credit-impaired financial instruments, as determined by 
the occurrence of one or more loss events, by estimating expected cash flows based on a chosen recovery strategy. 
Credit-impaired exposures may include positions for which no allowance has been recognized, for example because 
they are expected to be fully recoverable through collateral held.
– Changes in lifetime ECL since initial recognition are also recognized for assets that are purchased credit impaired (PCI). 
PCI financial instruments include those that are purchased at a deep discount or newly originated with a defaulted 
counterparty; they remain a separate category until derecognition. 
Consistent with the requirements of IFRS 3 and IFRS 9, immediately after the application of the acquisition method to 
the business combination, acquired financial instruments carried at amortized cost or FVOCI that are not deemed credit 
impaired are classified as stage 1 financial instruments and a maximum 12-month ECL is recognized, resulting in a 
carrying amount of the respective financial instruments below their acquisition-date fair value. 
All or part of a financial asset is written off if it is deemed uncollectible or forgiven. Write-offs reduce the principal amount 
of a claim and are charged against related allowances for credit losses. Recoveries, in part or in full, of amounts previously 
written off are generally credited to Credit loss expense / (release). 
ECL are recognized in the income statement in Credit loss expense / (release). A corresponding ECL allowance is reported 
as a decrease in the carrying amount of financial assets measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. For financial 
assets that are measured at FVOCI, the carrying amount is not reduced, but an accumulated amount is recognized in 
Other comprehensive income. For off-balance sheet financial instruments and other credit lines, provisions for ECL are 
presented in Provisions.
Default and credit impairment
UBS applies a single definition of default for credit risk management purposes, regulatory reporting and ECL, with a 
counterparty classified as defaulted based on quantitative and qualitative criteria.

Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 299
Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Measurement of expected credit losses
IFRS 9 ECL reflect an unbiased, probability-weighted estimate based on loss expectations resulting from default events. 
The method used to calculate ECL applies the following principal factors: probability of default (PD), loss given default 
(LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). Parameters are generally determined on an individual financial asset level. Based 
on the materiality of the portfolio, for credit card exposures and personal account overdrafts in Switzerland, a portfolio 
approach is applied that derives an average PD and LGD for the entire portfolio. PDs and LGDs used in the ECL calculation 
are point-in-time(PIT)-based for key portfolios and consider both current conditions and expected cyclical changes. For 
material portfolios, PDs and LGDs are determined for different scenarios, whereas EAD projections are treated as scenario 
independent.
For the purpose of determining the ECL-relevant parameters, UBS leverages its Basel III advanced internal ratings-based 
(A-IRB) models that are also used in determining expected loss (EL) and risk-weighted assets under the Basel III framework 
and Pillar 2 stress loss models. Adjustments have been made to these models and IFRS 9-related models have been 
developed that consider the complexity, structure and risk profile of relevant portfolios and take account of the fact that 
PDs and LGDs used in the ECL calculation are PIT-based, as opposed to the corresponding Basel III through-the-cycle 
(TTC) parameters. All models that are relevant for measuring expected credit losses are subject to UBS’s model validation 
and oversight processes. 
Probability of default: PD represents the probability of a default over a specified time period. A 12-month PD represents 
the probability of default determined for the next 12 months and a lifetime PD represents the probability of default over 
the remaining lifetime of the instrument. PIT PDs are derived from TTC PDs and scenario forecasts. The modeling is region, 
industry and client segment specific and considers both macroeconomic scenario dependencies and client-idiosyncratic 
information.
Exposure at default: EAD represents an estimate of the exposure to credit risk at the time of a potential default occurring, 
considering expected repayments, interest payments and accruals, discounted at the EIR. Future drawdowns on facilities 
are considered through a credit conversion factor (a CCF) that is reflective of historical drawdown and default patterns 
and the characteristics of the respective portfolios.
Loss given default: LGD represents an estimate of the loss at the time of a potential default occurring, taking into account 
expected future cash flows from collateral and other credit enhancements, or expected payouts from bankruptcy 
proceedings for unsecured claims and, where applicable, time to realization of collateral and the seniority of claims. LGD is 
commonly expressed as a percentage of EAD.
Estimation of expected credit losses
Number of scenarios and estimation of scenario weights
Determination of probability-weighted ECL requires evaluating a range of diverse and relevant future economic conditions, 
especially with a view to modeling the non-linear effect of assumptions about macroeconomic factors on the estimate. 
To accommodate this requirement, UBS uses different economic scenarios in the ECL calculation. Each scenario is 
represented by a specific scenario narrative, which is relevant considering the exposure of key portfolios to economic 
risks, and for which a set of consistent macroeconomic variables is determined. The estimation of the appropriate weights 
for these scenarios is predominantly judgment based. The assessment is based on a holistic review of the prevailing 
economic or political conditions, which may exhibit different levels of uncertainty. It takes into account the impact of 
changes in the nature and severity of the underlying scenario narratives and the projected economic variables. 
The determined weights constitute the probabilities that the respective set of macroeconomic conditions will occur and 
not that the chosen particular narratives with the related macroeconomic variables will materialize.
Macroeconomic and other factors
The range of macroeconomic, market and other factors that is modeled as part of the scenario determination is wide, 
and historical information is used to support the identification of the key factors. As the forecast horizon increases, the 
availability of information decreases, requiring an increase in judgment. For cycle-sensitive PD and LGD determination 
purposes, UBS projects the relevant economic factors for a period of three years before reverting, over a specified period, 
to cycle-neutral PD and LGD for longer-term projections. 
Factors relevant for ECL calculation vary by type of exposure. Regional and client-segment characteristics are generally 
taken into account, with specific focus on Switzerland and the US, considering UBS’s key ECL-relevant portfolios.
For UBS, the following forward-looking macroeconomic variables represent the most relevant factors for ECL calculation: 
– gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates, given their significant effect on borrowers’ performance; 
– unemployment rates, given their significant effect on private clients’ ability to meet contractual obligations; 
– house price indices, given their significant effect on mortgage collateral valuations; 
– interest rates, given their significant effect on counterparties’ abilities to service debt; 
– consumer price indices, given their overall relevance for companies’ performance, private clients’ purchasing power 
and economic stability; and
– equity indices, given that they are an important factor in UBS’s corporate rating tools.

Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Scenario generation, review process and governance
A team of economists, which is part of Group Risk Control, develops the forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions 
with involvement from a broad range of experts.
The scenarios, their weights and the key macroeconomic and other factors are subject to a critical assessment by the 
IFRS 9 Scenario Sounding Sessions and ECL Management Forum, which include senior management from Group Risk 
and Group Finance. Important aspects for the review include whether there may be particular credit risk concerns that 
may not be capable of being addressed systematically and require post-model adjustments for stage allocation and ECL 
allowance. 
The Group Model Governance Committee (the GMGC), as the highest authority under UBS’s model governance 
framework, ratifies the decisions taken by the ECL Management Forum. 
› Refer to Note 20 for more information
ECL measurement period 
The period for which lifetime ECL are determined is based on the maximum contractual period that UBS is exposed to 
credit risk, taking into account contractual extension, termination and prepayment options. For irrevocable loan 
commitments and financial guarantee contracts, the measurement period represents the maximum contractual period 
for which UBS has an obligation to extend credit.
Additionally, some financial instruments include both an on-demand loan and a revocable undrawn commitment, where 
the contractual cancellation right does not limit UBS’s exposure to credit risk to the contractual notice period, as the 
client has the ability to draw down funds before UBS can take risk-mitigating actions. In such cases UBS is required to 
estimate the period over which it is exposed to credit risk. This applies to UBS’s credit card limits, which do not have a 
defined contractual maturity date, are callable on demand and where the drawn and undrawn components are managed 
as one exposure. The exposure arising from UBS’s credit card limits is not significant and is managed at a portfolio level, 
with credit actions triggered when balances are past due. An ECL measurement period of seven years is applied for credit 
card limits, capped at 12 months for stage 1 balances, as a proxy for the period that UBS is exposed to credit risk.
Customary master credit agreements in the Swiss corporate market also include on-demand loans and revocable undrawn 
commitments. For smaller commercial facilities, a risk-based monitoring (RbM) approach is in place that highlights 
negative trends as risk events, at an individual facility level, based on a combination of continuously updated risk 
indicators. The risk events trigger additional credit reviews by a risk officer, enabling informed credit decisions to be 
taken. Larger corporate facilities are not subject to RbM, but are reviewed at least annually through a formal credit review. 
UBS has assessed these credit risk management practices and considers both the RbM approach and formal credit reviews 
as substantive credit reviews resulting in a re-origination of the given facility. Following this, a 12-month measurement 
period from the reporting date is used for both types of facilities as an appropriate proxy of the period over which UBS 
is exposed to credit risk, with 12 months also used as a look-back period for assessing an SICR, always from the respective 
reporting date.
Significant increase in credit risk 
Financial instruments subject to ECL are monitored on an ongoing basis. To determine whether the recognition of a 
maximum 12-month ECL continues to be appropriate, an assessment is made as to whether an SICR has occurred 
since initial recognition of the financial instrument, applying both quantitative and qualitative factors. 
Primarily, UBS assesses changes in an instrument’s risk of default on a quantitative basis by comparing the annualized 
forward-looking and scenario-weighted lifetime PD of an instrument determined at two different dates: 
– at the reporting date; and 
– at inception of the instrument.
If, based on UBS’s quantitative modeling, an increase exceeds a set threshold, an SICR is deemed to have occurred and 
the instrument is transferred to stage 2 with lifetime ECL recognized.
The threshold applied varies depending on the original credit quality of the borrower, with a higher SICR threshold set 
for those instruments with a low PD at inception. The SICR assessment based on PD changes is made at an individual 
financial asset level. A high-level overview of the SICR trigger, which is a multiple of the annualized remaining lifetime 
PIT PD expressed in rating downgrades, is provided in the “SICR thresholds” table below. The actual SICR thresholds 
applied are defined on a more granular level by interpolating between the values shown in the table.

Irrespective of the SICR assessment based on default probabilities, credit risk is generally deemed to have significantly 
increased for an instrument if contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. For certain less material portfolios, 
specifically the Swiss credit card portfolio, the 30-day past due criterion is used as the primary indicator of an SICR. Where 
instruments are transferred to stage 2 due to the 30-day past due criterion, a minimum period of six months is applied 
before a transfer back to stage 1 can be triggered, where applicable. For instruments in Personal & Corporate Banking 
and Global Wealth Management Region Switzerland that are between 90 and 180 days past due but have not been 
reclassified to stage 3, a one-year period is applied before a transfer back to stage 1 can be triggered.
Additionally, based on individual counterparty-specific indicators, external market indicators of credit risk or general 
economic conditions, counterparties may be moved to a watch list, which is used as a secondary qualitative indicator for 
an SICR. Exception management is further applied, allowing for individual and collective adjustments on exposures 
sharing the same credit risk characteristics to take account of specific situations that are not otherwise fully reflected.
In general, the overall SICR determination process does not apply to Lombard loans, securities financing transactions and 
certain other asset-based lending transactions, because of the risk management practices adopted, including daily 
monitoring processes with strict margining. If margin calls are not satisfied, a position is closed out and classified as a 
stage 3 position. In exceptional cases, an individual adjustment and a transfer into stage 2 may be made to take account 
of specific facts.
Credit risk officers are responsible for the identification of an SICR, which for accounting purposes is in some respects 
different from internal credit risk management processes. This difference mainly arises because ECL accounting 
requirements are instrument-specific, such that a borrower can have multiple exposures allocated to different stages, and 
maturing loans in stage 2 will migrate to stage 1 upon renewal irrespective of the actual credit risk at that time. Under a 
risk-based approach, a holistic counterparty credit assessment and the absolute level of risk at any given date will 
determine what risk-mitigating actions may be warranted.
› Refer to the “Risk management and control” section of this report for more information
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The calculation of ECL requires management to apply significant judgment and make estimates and assumptions that can result in significant changes to the 
timing and the amount of ECL recognized. 
Determination of a significant increase in credit risk 
IFRS 9 does not include a definition of what constitutes an SICR, with UBS’s assessment considering qualitative and quantitative criteria. An IFRS 9 ECL 
Management Forum has been established to review and challenge the SICR results.
Scenarios, scenario weights and macroeconomic variables 
ECL reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount, which UBS determines by evaluating a range of possible outcomes. Management selects forwardlooking scenarios that include relevant macroeconomic variables and management’s assumptions around future economic conditions. IFRS 9 Scenario 
Sounding Sessions, in addition to the IFRS 9 ECL Management Forum, are in place to derive, review and challenge the scenario selection and weights, and 
to determine whether any additional post-model adjustments are required that may significantly affect ECL. 
ECL measurement period
Lifetime ECL are generally determined based upon the contractual maturity of the transaction, which significantly affects ECL. For credit card limits and Swiss 
callable master credit facilities, judgment is required, as UBS must determine the period over which it is exposed to credit risk. A seven-year period is applied 
for credit card limits, capped at 12 months for stage 1 positions, and a 12-month period applied for master credit facilities. 
Modeling and post-model adjustments
A number of complex models have been developed or modified to calculate ECL, with additional post-model adjustments required that may significantly 
affect ECL. The models are governed by UBS’s model validation controls and approved by the GMGC. The post-model adjustments are approved by the ECL 
Management Forum and endorsed by the GMGC.
A sensitivity analysis covering key macroeconomic variables, scenario weights and SICR trigger points on ECL measurement is provided in Note 20f.

Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
h. Restructured and modified financial assets
When payment default is expected, or where default has already occurred, UBS may grant concessions to borrowers in 
financial difficulties that it would not consider in the normal course of its business, such as preferential interest rates, 
extension of maturity, modifying the schedule of repayments, debt / equity swap, subordination, etc. 
› Refer to the “Risk management and control” section of this report for more information
Modifications result in an alteration of future contractual cash flows and can occur within UBS’s normal risk tolerance or 
as part of a credit restructuring where a counterparty is in financial difficulties. The restructuring or modification of a 
financial asset could lead to a substantial change in the terms and conditions, resulting in the original financial asset 
being derecognized and a new financial asset being recognized. Where the modification does not result in a 
derecognition, any difference between the modified contractual cash flows discounted at the original EIR and the existing 
gross carrying amount of the given financial asset is recognized in the income statement as a modification gain or loss. 
i. Offsetting
UBS presents financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet net if (i) it has a legally enforceable right to set off the 
recognized amounts and (ii) it intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. Netted positions include, for example, certain derivatives and repurchase and reverse repurchase 
transactions with various counterparties, exchanges and clearing houses.
In assessing whether UBS intends to either settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously, emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of operational settlement mechanics in eliminating substantially 
all credit and liquidity exposure between the counterparties. This condition precludes offsetting on the balance sheet for 
substantial amounts of UBS’s financial assets and liabilities, even though they may be subject to enforceable netting 
arrangements. Repurchase arrangements and securities financing transactions are presented net only to the extent that 
the settlement mechanism eliminates, or results in insignificant, credit and liquidity risk, and processes the receivables 
and payables in a single settlement process or cycle.
› Refer to Note 22 for more information 
j. Hedge accounting
The Group applies hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9 where the criteria for documentation and hedge 
effectiveness are met. If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is 
discontinued. Voluntary discontinuation of hedge accounting is not permitted under IFRS 9.
Fair value hedges of interest rate risk related to debt instruments and loan assets
The fair value change of the hedged item attributable to a hedged risk is reflected as an adjustment to the carrying 
amount of the hedged item and recognized in the income statement along with the change in the fair value of the 
hedging instrument.
Fair value hedges of FX risk related to debt instruments
The fair value change of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is reflected in the measurement of the hedged 
item and recognized in the income statement along with the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. The 
foreign currency basis spread of cross-currency swaps designated as hedging derivatives is excluded from the designation 
and accounted for as a cost of hedging with amounts deferred in Other comprehensive income within Equity. These 
amounts are released to the income statement over the term of the hedged item.
Discontinuation of fair value hedges
Discontinuations for reasons other than derecognition of the hedged item result in an adjustment to the carrying amount, 
which is amortized to the income statement over the remaining life of the hedged item using the effective interest 
method. If the hedged item is derecognized, the unamortized fair value adjustment or deferred cost of hedging amount 
is recognized immediately in the income statement as part of any derecognition gain or loss.
Cash flow hedges of forecast transactions
Fair value gains or losses associated with the effective portion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges for cash flow 
repricing risk are recognized initially in Other comprehensive income within Equity and reclassified to Interest income 
from financial instruments measured at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income or Interest 
expense from financial instruments measured at amortized cost in the periods when the hedged forecast cash flows 
affect profit or loss, including discontinued hedges for which forecast cash flows are expected to occur. If the forecast 
transactions are no longer expected to occur, the deferred gains or losses are immediately reclassified to the income 
statement.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of a hedge are recognized directly in Other 
comprehensive income within Equity, while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective and / or undesignated portion 
(for example, the interest element of a forward contract) are recognized in the income statement. Upon disposal or partial 
disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recognized in Equity associated with 
the entity is reclassified to Other income.

Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform 
UBS continued hedge accounting during the period of uncertainty before existing interest rate benchmarks were replaced 
with alternative risk-free interest rates. During this period, UBS assumed that the current benchmark rates would continue 
to exist, such that forecast transactions were considered highly probable and hedge relationships remain, with little or 
no consequential impact on the financial statements. Upon replacement of existing interest rate benchmarks by 
alternative risk-free interest rates, UBS applied the requirements of Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and 
IFRS 16 (Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2), where applicable.
› Refer to Note 26 for more information
3) Fee and commission income and expenses
UBS earns fee income from the diverse range of services it provides to its clients. Fee income can be divided into two 
broad categories: fees earned from services that are provided over a certain period of time, such as management of 
clients’ assets, custody services and certain advisory services; and fees earned from PIT services, such as underwriting fees, 
deal-contingent merger and acquisitions fees, and brokerage fees (e.g., securities and derivatives execution and clearing). 
UBS recognizes fees earned from PIT services when it has fully provided the service to the client. Where the contract 
requires services to be provided over time, income is recognized on a systematic basis over the life of the agreement.
Consideration received is allocated to the separately identifiable performance obligations in a contract. Owing to the 
nature of UBS’s business, contracts that include multiple performance obligations are typically those that are considered 
to include a series of similar performance obligations fulfilled over time with the same pattern of transfer to the client, 
e.g., management of client assets and custodial services. As a consequence, UBS is not required to apply significant 
judgment in allocating the consideration received across the various performance obligations.
PIT services are generally for a fixed price or dependent on deal size, e.g., a fixed number of basis points of trade size, 
where the amount of revenue is known when the performance obligation is met. Fixed-over-time fees are recognized on 
a straight-line basis over the performance period. Custodial and asset management fees can be variable through reference 
to the size of the customer portfolio. However, they are generally billed on a monthly or quarterly basis once the 
customer’s portfolio size is known or known with near certainty and therefore also recognized ratably over the 
performance period. UBS does not recognize performance fees related to management of clients’ assets or fees related 
to contingencies beyond UBS’s control until such uncertainties are resolved. 
UBS’s fees are generally earned from short-term contracts. As a result, UBS’s contracts do not include a financing 
component or result in the recognition of significant receivables or prepayment assets. Furthermore, due to the shortterm nature of such contracts, UBS has not capitalized any material costs to obtain or fulfill a contract or generated any 
significant contract assets or liabilities.
UBS presents expenses primarily in line with their nature in the income statement, differentiating between expenses that 
are directly attributable to the satisfaction of specific performance obligations associated with the generation of revenues, 
which are generally presented within Total revenues as Fee and commission expense, and those that are related to 
personnel, general and administrative expenses, or depreciation and amortization, which are presented within Operating 
expenses. For derivatives execution and clearing services (where UBS acts as an agent), UBS only records its specific fees 
in the income statement, with fees payable to other parties not recognized as an expense but instead directly offset 
against the associated income collected from the given client.
› Refer to Note 5 for more information, including the disaggregation of revenues
4) Share-based and other deferred compensation plans
UBS recognizes expenses for deferred compensation awards over the period that the employee is required to provide 
service to become entitled to the award. Where the service period is shortened, for example in the case of employees 
affected by restructuring programs or mutually agreed termination provisions, recognition of such expense is accelerated 
to the termination date. Where no future service is required, such as for employees who are eligible for retirement or 
who have met certain age and length-of-service criteria, the services are presumed to have been received and 
compensation expense is recognized over the performance year or, in the case of off-cycle awards, immediately on the 
grant date.
Share-based compensation plans
Share-based compensation expense is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments on the date of 
grant, taking into account the terms and conditions inherent in the award, including, where relevant, dividend rights, 
transfer restrictions in effect beyond the vesting date, market conditions, and non-vesting conditions. 
For equity-settled awards, fair value is not remeasured unless the terms of the award are modified such that there is an 
incremental increase in value. Expenses are recognized, on a per-tranche basis, over the service period based on an 
estimate of the number of instruments expected to vest and are adjusted to reflect the actual outcomes of service or 
performance conditions. 
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 304
Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
For equity-settled awards, forfeiture events resulting from a breach of a non-vesting condition (i.e., one that does not 
relate to a service or performance condition) do not result in any adjustment to the share-based compensation expense.
For cash-settled share-based awards, fair value is remeasured at each reporting date, so that the cumulative expense 
recognized equals the cash distributed. 
Other deferred compensation plans
Compensation expense for other deferred compensation plans is recognized on a per-tranche or straight-line basis, 
depending on the nature of the plan. The amount recognized is measured based on the present value of the amount 
expected to be paid under the plan and is remeasured at each reporting date, so that the cumulative expense recognized 
equals the cash or the fair value of respective financial instruments distributed.
› Refer to Note 28 for more information
5) Post-employment benefit plans
Defined benefit plans
Defined benefit plans specify an amount of benefit that an employee will receive, which usually depends on one or more 
factors, such as age, years of service and compensation. The defined benefit liability recognized in the balance sheet is 
the present value of the defined benefit obligation, measured using the projected unit credit method, less the fair value 
of the plan’s assets at the balance sheet date, with changes resulting from remeasurements recorded immediately in 
Other comprehensive income. If the fair value of the plan’s assets is higher than the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation, the recognition of the resulting net asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the 
form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. Calculation of the net defined benefit 
obligation or asset takes into account the specific features of each plan, including risk sharing between employee and 
employer, and is calculated periodically by independent qualified actuaries.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
The net defined benefit liability or asset at the balance sheet date and the related personnel expense depend on the expected future benefits to be provided, 
determined using a number of economic and demographic assumptions. A range of assumptions could be applied, and different assumptions could 
significantly alter the defined benefit liability or asset and pension expense recognized. The most significant assumptions include life expectancy, discount 
rate, expected salary increases, pension increases and interest credits on retirement savings account balances. Sensitivity analysis for reasonable possible 
movements in each significant assumption for UBS‘s post-employment obligations is provided in Note 27.
› Refer to Note 27 for more information
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan pays fixed contributions into a separate entity from which post-employment and other 
benefits are paid. UBS has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts if the plan does not hold sufficient 
assets to pay employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Compensation expense 
is recognized when the employees have rendered services in exchange for contributions. This is generally in the year of 
contribution. Prepaid contributions are recognized as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future 
payments is available.
6) Income taxes
UBS is subject to the income tax laws of Switzerland and those of the non-Swiss jurisdictions in which UBS has business 
operations.
The Group’s provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes represent taxes 
to be paid or refunded for the current period or previous periods. 
Deferred tax assets (DTAs) and deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) are recognized for temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in deductible or taxable amounts, respectively in 
future periods. DTAs may also arise from other sources, including unused tax losses and unused tax credits. DTAs and 
DTLs are measured using the applicable tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end 
of the reporting period and that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.
DTAs are recognized only to the extent it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which these 
differences can be used. When an entity or tax group has a history of recent losses, DTAs are only recognized to the 
extent that there are sufficient taxable temporary differences or there is convincing other evidence that sufficient taxable 
profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilized.
Deferred and current tax assets and liabilities are offset when: (i) they arise in the same tax reporting group; (ii) they relate 
to the same tax authority; (iii) the legal right to offset exists; and (iv) with respect to current taxes they are intended to 
be settled net or realized simultaneously.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 305
Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Current and deferred taxes are recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the income statement, except for current 
and deferred taxes recognized in relation to: (i) the acquisition of a subsidiary (for which such amounts would affect the 
amount of goodwill arising from the acquisition); (ii) gains and losses on the sale of treasury shares (for which the tax 
effects are recognized directly in Equity); (iii) unrealized gains or losses on financial instruments that are classified at 
FVOCI; (iv) changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges; (v) remeasurements of defined 
benefit plans; or (vi) certain foreign currency translations of foreign operations. Amounts relating to points (iii) through 
(vi) above are recognized in Other comprehensive income within Equity.
UBS reflects the potential effect of uncertain tax positions for which acceptance by the relevant tax authority is not 
considered probable by adjusting current or deferred taxes, as applicable, using either the most likely amount or expected 
value methods, depending on which method is deemed a better predictor of the basis on which, and extent to which, 
the uncertainty will be resolved. 
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
Tax laws are complex, and judgment and interpretations about the application of such laws are required when accounting for income taxes. UBS considers 
the performance of its businesses and the accuracy of historical forecasts and other factors when evaluating the recoverability of its DTAs, including the 
remaining tax loss carry-forward period, and its assessment of expected future taxable profits in the forecast period used for recognizing DTAs. Estimating 
future profitability and business plan forecasts is inherently subjective and is particularly sensitive to future economic, market and other conditions. 
Forecasts are reviewed annually, but adjustments may be made at other times, if required. If recent losses have been incurred, convincing evidence is required 
to prove there is sufficient future profitability given that the value of UBS’s DTAs may be affected, with effects primarily recognized through the income 
statement.
In addition, judgment is required to assess the expected value of uncertain tax positions and the related probabilities, including interpretation of tax laws, 
the resolution of any income tax-related appeals and litigation. 
› Refer to Note 9 for more information 
7) Investments in associates
Interests in entities where UBS has significant influence over the financial and operating policies of these entities but does 
not have control are classified as investments in associates and accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 
Typically, UBS has significant influence when it holds, or has the ability to hold, between 20% and 50% of an entity’s 
voting rights. Investments in associates are initially recognized at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased 
after the date of acquisition to recognize the Group’s share of the investee’s comprehensive income and any impairment 
losses. The net investment in an associate is impaired if there is objective evidence of a loss event and the carrying amount 
of the investment in the associate exceeds its recoverable amount.
› Refer to Note 29 for more information
8) Property, equipment and software
Property, equipment and software is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Software 
development costs are capitalized only when the costs can be measured reliably and it is probable that future economic 
benefits will arise. Depreciation of property, equipment and software begins when they are available for use and is 
calculated on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. 
Property, equipment and software are generally tested for impairment at the appropriate cash-generating unit level, 
alongside goodwill and intangible assets as described in item 9 in this Note. An impairment charge is recognized for such 
assets if the recoverable amount is below its carrying amount. The recoverable amounts of such assets, other than 
property that has a market price, are generally determined using a replacement cost approach that reflects the amount 
that would be currently required by a market participant to replace the service capacity of the asset. If such assets are no 
longer used, they are tested individually for impairment.
› Refer to Note 12 for more information
9) Goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired that arises in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at the end 
of each reporting period, or when indicators of impairment exist. UBS tests goodwill for impairment annually, irrespective 
of whether there is any indication of impairment. An impairment charge is recognized in the income statement if the 
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit.
Negative goodwill, generally determined based on the difference between the (provisional) fair values for the identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed and consideration transferred, is recognized in the income statement on the 
acquisition date.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 306
Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Separately from goodwill, UBS recognizes identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination that were not 
previously recognized in the financial statements of the acquiree. Amortization of these intangible assets is recognized 
on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. These assets are tested for impairment at the appropriate cashgenerating-unit level.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
UBS‘s methodology for goodwill impairment testing is based on a model that is most sensitive to the following key assumptions: (i) forecasts of earnings 
available to shareholders (typically estimated on a discrete basis for years one to three but could extend up to five years, as permitted under IFRS Accounting 
Standards, in order to reflect facts and circumstances specific to a cash-generating unit); (ii) changes in the discount rates; and (iii) changes in the long-term 
growth rate. 
Earnings available to shareholders are estimated on the basis of forecast results, which are part of the business plan approved by the BoD. The discount rates 
and growth rates are determined using external information, and also considering inputs from both internal and external analysts and the view of 
management. 
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of each cash-generating unit are tested for sensitivity by applying reasonably possible 
changes to those assumptions. 
› Refer to Notes 3 and 13 for more information 
10) Provisions and contingent liabilities
Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount, and are generally recognized in accordance with IAS 37, Provisions, 
Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, when: (i) UBS has a present obligation as a result of a past event; (ii) it is 
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and (iii) a reliable estimate of the amount 
of the obligation can be made. 
The majority of UBS’s provisions relate to litigation, regulatory and similar matters, restructuring, and employee benefits. 
Restructuring provisions are generally recognized as a consequence of management agreeing to materially change the 
scope of the business or the manner in which it is conducted, including changes in management structures. Provisions 
for employee benefits relate mainly to service anniversaries and sabbatical leave, and are recognized in accordance with 
measurement principles set out in item 4 in this Note. In addition, UBS presents expected credit loss allowances within 
Provisions if they relate to a loan commitment, financial guarantee contract or a revolving revocable credit line. Consistent 
with this presentational approach, fair value of loans commitments and financial guarantees acquired through a business 
combination is also presented in Provisions.
IAS 37 provisions are measured considering the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present 
obligation at the balance sheet date. 
When conditions required to recognize a provision are not met, a contingent liability is disclosed, unless the likelihood of 
an outflow of resources is remote. Contingent liabilities are also disclosed for possible obligations that arise from past 
events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by uncertain future events not wholly within the control of UBS.
Contingent liabilities, more specifically in relation to litigations, recognized in a business combination are initially 
measured at fair value. Subsequently, they are measured at the higher of the initial fair value and the amount that would 
be recognized in accordance with the requirements for provisions outlined above, until the contingency is resolved.
Critical accounting estimates and judgments
Recognition of provisions often involves significant judgment in assessing the existence of an obligation that results from past events and in estimating the 
probability, the timing and the amount of any outflows of resources. This is particularly the case for litigation, regulatory and similar matters, which, due to 
their nature, are subject to many uncertainties, making their outcome difficult to predict. 
The amount of any provision recognized is sensitive to the assumptions used, and there could be a wide range of possible outcomes for any particular matter.
Management regularly reviews all the available information regarding such matters, including legal advice, to assess whether the recognition criteria for 
provisions have been satisfied and to determine the timing and the amount of any potential outflows.

Transactions denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency of the reporting entity at the 
spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. At the balance sheet date, all monetary assets, including those at 
FVOCI, and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency using the 
closing exchange rate. Translation differences are reported in Other net income from financial instruments measured at 
fair value through profit or loss.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 307
Note 1 Summary of material accounting policies (continued)
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. 
Upon consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into US dollars, UBS’s presentation currency, 
at the closing exchange rate on the balance sheet date, and income and expense items and other comprehensive income 
are translated at the average rate for the period. The resulting foreign currency translation differences are recognized in 
Equity and reclassified to the income statement when UBS disposes of, partially or in its entirety, the foreign operation and 
UBS no longer controls the foreign operation.
Share capital issued, share premium and treasury shares held are translated at the historic average rate, with the difference 
between the historic average rate and the spot rate realized upon repayment of share capital or disposal of treasury shares 
reported as Share premium. Cumulative amounts recognized in Other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow hedges 
and financial assets measured at FVOCI are translated at the closing exchange rate as of the balance sheet dates, with any 
translation effects adjusted through Retained earnings.

12) UBS Group AG shares held (treasury shares) 
UBS Group AG shares held by the Group, including those purchased as part of market-making activities, are presented 
in Equity as Treasury shares at their acquisition cost and are deducted from Equity until they are canceled or reissued. 
The difference between the proceeds from sales of treasury shares and their weighted average cost (net of tax, if any) is 
reported as Share premium.
b) Changes in accounting policies, comparability and other adjustments
New or amended accounting standards 
IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts
Effective from 1 January 2023, UBS has adopted IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts, which sets out the accounting 
requirements for contractual rights and obligations that arise from insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contracts 
held. The adoption has had no material effect on the Group’s financial statements. 
Amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes
In May 2023, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes, in relation to top-up taxes on income under Global 
Anti-Base Erosion Rules that is imposed under legislation that has been enacted or substantively enacted to implement 
the Pillar Two model rules published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Certain countries in which the Group operates had enacted such legislation by 31 December 2023, including Switzerland, 
which introduced a tax with effect from 1 January 2024 that is expected to be a qualified domestic minimum top-up tax, 
and other countries (including Germany, France and Italy) also introduced top-up taxes in respect of a non-domestic 
group’s worldwide operations with effect from 1 January 2025. Moreover, it is expected that other countries will enact 
such legislation in 2024.
The amendments to IAS 12 introduced an exception, whereby deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities should not 
be recognized or disclosed in respect of top-up taxes, which has been applied for the purposes of these financial 
statements. 
An assessment was performed of the Group’s potential exposure to top-up taxes under legislation that was enacted or 
substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two model rules by 31 December 2023, reflecting country-by-country 
reporting and, also, the corporate tax expenses of Group entities for recent years and those expected in future years. This 
assessment indicated that the Group’s profits in future years are expected to be almost entirely earned in countries with 
corporate tax expenses that are at a tax rate of 15% or more and will not, therefore, be subject to top-up taxes. 
Consequently, the Group is not expected to have a material annual exposure to top-up taxes for future years under this 
legislation. 
c) IFRS Accounting Standards and Interpretations to be adopted in 2024 and later and other changes
Other amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards
The IASB has issued a number of minor amendments to IFRS Accounting Standards, effective from 1 January 2024 and 
later. These amendments are not expected to have a significant effect on the Group when they are adopted.

Note 2 Accounting for the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group
The transaction
On 12 June 2023, UBS Group AG acquired Credit Suisse Group AG, succeeding by operation of Swiss law to all assets 
and liabilities of Credit Suisse Group AG, and became the direct or indirect shareholder of all of the former direct and 
indirect subsidiaries of Credit Suisse Group AG (the Transaction).
The acquisition followed a request from the Swiss Federal Department of Finance, the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss 
Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to both firms to duly consider the Transaction in order to restore necessary 
confidence in the stability of the Swiss economy and banking system and to serve the best interests of the shareholders 
and stakeholders of UBS and Credit Suisse. The firms subsequently entered into a merger agreement on 19 March 2023.
Upon the completion of the Transaction, each outstanding registered Credit Suisse Group AG share converted to the 
right to receive, subject to the payment of certain fees to the Credit Suisse Depositary in the case of Credit Suisse 
American depositary shares, a merger consideration consisting of 1/22.48 UBS Group AG shares. In aggregate, Credit 
Suisse Group AG shareholders received 5.1% of the outstanding UBS Group AG shares on the acquisition date, with a 
purchase price of USD 3.7bn.
Accounting principles: conversion from US GAAP to IFRS Accounting Standards of the Credit Suisse Group 
and IFRS 3 purchase price allocation 
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group constitutes a business combination under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, and 
is required to be accounted for by applying the acquisition method of accounting.
As part of the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of the Credit Suisse Group have been converted 
from US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to IFRS Accounting Standards. The most material conversion 
impact arose from the different derivative netting rules, resulting in an increase in Total assets of USD 70bn, with no 
impact on Equity. Other conversion adjustments arose from the removal of the Swiss pension surplus and the different 
methods used to calculate expected credit losses.
› Refer to Note 20 for more information about the expected credit losses recognized as an additional measurement adjustment 
following the acquisition date
Remeasurement of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet arrangements at the acquisition date as part of 
the IFRS 3 purchase price allocation
Financial instruments
The financial assets and liabilities of the Credit Suisse Group have been remeasured to fair value as of the acquisition 
date, resulting in the provisional fair values disclosed below, with negative fair value adjustments of USD 14.9bn, 
including USD 4.8bn recognized on financial instruments that are classified at fair value through profit or loss and fair 
value adjustments of USD 10.1bn recognized on financial instruments at amortized cost and off-balance sheet 
commitments and guarantees. Fair value adjustments on financial instruments measured at fair value on the acquisition 
date were primarily driven by a change in management’s view of the principal and most advantageous markets and to 
reflect additional liquidity adjustments.
In particular, material fair value adjustments have been made regarding the Credit Suisse Group lending portfolio, 
including mortgages and corporate lending, to bring the financial instruments from amortized cost to fair value. Fair 
value adjustments applied to amortized-cost financial instruments and lending arrangements that are fair valued through 
profit or loss will generally accrete to par over their expected lives through Interest income from financial instruments 
measured at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income, Fee and commission income and Other 
net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss in the income statement if the 
instruments continue to be held. 
› Refer to Note 21 for more information
Adjustments have also been made to other asset and liability categories, with new intangible assets of USD 0.9bn and 
additional litigation provisions and contingent liabilities of USD 5.4bn recognized as detailed below. Furthermore, Credit 
Suisse Group goodwill has been derecognized, the fair value of its internally generated software has been marked down 
in consideration of how market participants would value acquired software, and its real estate held and leased has been 
revalued. 
With the acquisition date of 12 June 2023, for convenience the Credit Suisse Group was consolidated from 31 May 2023, 
as the impact of transactions and activities in the period from 31 May 2023 to 12 June 2023 on the consolidated financial 
statements was not material.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 309
Note 2 Accounting for the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group (continued)
Intangible assets
Included in Intangible assets is a fair value of USD 0.9bn for core deposits and customer relationship intangibles, which 
were recognized as part of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. These assets were not previously recognized in the 
financial statements of the Credit Suisse Group. The fair value of the core deposits intangible asset was determined using 
the after-tax cost savings method under the income approach. After-tax cost savings were estimated by comparing the 
cost of the existing deposits (including the cost of maintaining them) to the cost of obtaining alternative funds from a 
mix of diversified funding sources available to market participants. The core deposits intangible asset represents the 
present value of the after-tax cost savings expected to be realized over the remaining useful life of the deposits. The fair 
value of the customer relationship intangible asset was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method (an 
income-based valuation methodology), by discounting estimated after-tax excess earnings attributable to existing 
customer relationships over their remaining useful lives. Both intangible asset valuations include assumptions consistent 
with how a market participant would estimate fair values, such as growth and attrition rates and projected fee and 
interest income, as well as related costs to service the relationships and deposits, and discount rates. 
Also included in Intangible assets are mortgage-servicing rights (MSRs) of USD 0.4bn, which represent the right to 
perform specified mortgage-servicing activities on behalf of third parties, generating income through servicing fees. The 
MSRs were valued using a discounted cash flow model. 
Additional provisions and contingent liabilities 
Included in Provisions and contingent liabilities is USD 5.4bn for additional litigation provisions and contingent liabilities, 
which includes USD 1.6bn for litigation provisions, in addition to the existing USD 1.3bn provision previously recorded by 
the Credit Suisse Group to reflect management’s assessment of the associated probability, timing and amount 
considering new information, and USD 3.8bn contingent liabilities for certain obligations in respect of litigation, 
regulatory and similar matters identified in the purchase price allocation. The timing and actual amount of outflows 
associated with litigation matters are uncertain. UBS has continued to assess the development of these obligations and 
the amount and timing of potential outflows. The USD 3.8bn contingent liabilities reflects an increase of USD 0.8bn from 
the previously reported USD 3.0bn, with an additional USD 45m increase in litigation provisions recognized, following 
publication of the UBS Group fourth quarter report as detailed in the table on the following page.
In addition, UBS has also recognized USD 4.5bn for fair value adjustments on acquired loan commitments and guarantees 
recognized under IFRS Accounting Standards as a consequence of the acquisition, of which USD 2.3bn is included in 
Provisions and contingent liabilities and USD 2.2bn is included as fair value loan commitments within Derivative financial 
instruments liabilities, consistent with the classification of financial assets that arise from drawdowns of these loan 
commitments.

weighted average cost of treasury shares in the UBS Group balance sheet on the closing date taken as an adjustment to share premium. As of 12 June 2023, this resulted in a total purchase price of approximately 
USD 3.7bn, based on the UBS Group AG share price on 12 June 2023 and before considering the effect of pre-existing relationships. 2 Represents the value of share-based compensation awards outstanding to 
Credit Suisse employees attributable to the service period completed on the date of acquisition.

Note 2 Accounting for the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group (continued)
IFRS 3 measurement period adjustments for the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group
The acquisition of Credit Suisse AG was made without the ordinary due diligence procedures and outside the 
conventional time frame for an acquisition of this scale and nature. As such, complete information about all relevant 
facts and circumstances of the acquisition date were not practically available to UBS at the time when the initial acquisition 
accounting was applied for the purpose of the UBS Group second quarter 2023 report, third quarter 2023 report and 
fourth quarter 2023 report. Due to the complexity and size of the transaction and the integration process, it is possible 
that new information about relevant facts and circumstances of the acquisition date becomes available to the 
management after the date of issuance of these financial statements. Consequently, the amounts that form part of the 
business combination accounting are considered provisional and may be subject to further measurement period 
adjustments if new information about the facts and circumstances existing on the date of the acquisition is obtained 
within one year from the acquisition date.
In the second half of 2023, in light of the additional information about circumstances existing on the acquisition date that 
became available to the management, IFRS 3 measurement period adjustments were made in Non-core and Legacy, 
reflecting additional decisions to sell acquired loans and off-balance sheet loan commitments. In addition, further IFRS 3 
measurement period adjustments have been made to the acquisition date fair value of certain loans and off-balance sheet 
loan commitments following a detailed review in Non-core and Legacy, Personal & Corporate Banking and Global Wealth 
Management, and to litigation contingent liabilities in Non-core and Legacy.
Additionally, several presentational changes resulted in a reclassification of financial assets reported at fair value not held 
for trading to financial assets at fair value held for trading in the acquisition date balance sheet to align with presentational 
approaches followed by the UBS Group.
Previously reported financial information has been revised for these effects as set out in the table below.

Note 2 Accounting for the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group (continued)
The table below provides details of the measurement period adjustments shown above.
Reference Measurement period adjustment
2 The application of measurement period adjustments to the accounting for the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group resulted in the 
following classification and measurement changes in accordance with IFRS 9 in 2023, with respective application in the acquisition date 
balance sheet:
– USD 14.3bn of loans and advances to customers and USD 12m of other financial assets measured at amortized cost in Non-core and 
Legacy previously reported in the UBS Group second quarter 2023 report as accounted for on an amortized-cost basis were 
reclassified in the UBS Group third and fourth quarter 2023 reports to financial assets measured at fair value held for trading; 
– USD 27.5bn notional value of loan commitments and a corresponding USD 2.0bn fair value, previously not subject to ongoing 
remeasurement at fair value, were reclassified to derivative loan commitments measured at fair value through profit or loss in the UBS 
Group third quarter 2023 report; and
– USD 0.3bn of derivative liabilities decreased, with a corresponding decrease of USD 0.3bn in financial assets measured at fair value 
held for trading in the acquisition date balance sheet, in the UBS Group fourth quarter 2023 report.
As a consequence of the classification and measurement adjustments, USD 0.1bn of stage 1 and 2 expected credit losses have been 
reversed from the income statement and, accordingly, a USD 0.1bn increase in net profit recognized in the second quarter of 2023. 
Additionally, interest income of USD 0.2bn for the quarter ended 30 September 2023 (USD 0.1bn for the quarter ended 30 June 2023) 
was reclassified from Interest income from financial instruments measured at amortized cost and fair value through other 
comprehensive income to Net interest income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss and other, with 
no impact on Net interest income.
3 A reclassification of USD 7.1bn of financial assets reported at fair value not held for trading to financial assets at fair value held for 
trading was performed in the fourth quarter of 2023 to align with the presentation approach followed by the UBS Group.
4 After the publication of the UBS Group fourth quarter 2023 report and following the completion of detailed assessments and reviews of 
acquisition date fair values, several measurement period adjustments were approved by management, mainly resulting in the following 
changes:
– a USD 0.3bn decrease in the fair value for loans and advances to customers measured at amortized cost as of 31 May 2023 mainly 
following individual counterparty credit assessments; and
– a USD 0.9bn increase in provisions and contingent liabilities related to litigation recognized in accordance with IFRS 3 as of 31 May 
2023 following further comprehensive reviews, including of additional information, which impact the assessment of possible and 
probable outcomes as of the acquisition date. USD 0.8bn of the USD 0.9bn increase relates to contingent liabilities, with the 
remaining USD 45m from litigation provisions.
These changes have resulted in a net USD 1.2bn reduction to negative goodwill resulting from the acquisition compared with the 
amount originally published in the UBS Group second quarter 2023 report.
Determination of negative goodwill
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group on 12 June 2023 resulted in provisional negative goodwill of USD 27.7bn. This 
negative goodwill represents the difference between the fair values for the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed, except for amounts related to leases and employee benefits, which have been determined by applying the 
requirements in IFRS 16 and IAS 19, respectively, and consideration transferred.
The USD 27.7bn provisional negative goodwill is USD 1.2bn lower than the previously reported USD 28.9bn provisional 
negative goodwill following further measurement period adjustments concluded after publication of the UBS Group 
fourth quarter 2023 report as detailed in the table above. 
The negative goodwill has been recognized as of the acquisition date in the income statement on a separate line, Negative 
goodwill. The pre-tax gain arising from negative goodwill on the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group did not result in 
any tax expense.
Acquisition-related costs to effect the acquisition 
UBS incurred certain acquisition-related costs to effect the acquisition. These consisted primarily of advisory, legal and 
consulting fees. These costs were expensed as incurred. In 2023, a total of USD 0.2bn was included in General and 
administrative expenses in the income statement. 
Derecognition of loans and loan commitments
During the second half of 2023, the Group recognized gains on the early termination and natural roll-off, accelerated by 
actions to actively unwind the portfolio in Non-core and Legacy on loans and loan commitments of USD 0.1bn and 
USD 0.6bn, respectively.
Pro forma financial information
From the date of acquisition until 31 December 2023, the Credit Suisse Group contributed USD 7.6bn of net revenues 
and an overall net loss of USD 3.5bn to the net profit of the UBS Group. For illustration purposes, the pro forma net 
revenues and net loss for the UBS Group for the year ended 31 December 2023 if the business combination had taken 
place on 1 January 2023 are estimated as USD 46.1bn and USD 2.1bn, respectively. 
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 313
Note 2 Accounting for the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group (continued)
This pro forma information is based on the actual annual results of the consolidated UBS Group, as reported (including 
Credit Suisse for the seven months since the acquisition), and the Credit Suisse US GAAP results for the first five months 
of 2023, adjusted for the estimated effect of conversion to IFRS Accounting Standards and the effects from purchase 
price allocation adjustments under IFRS 3, Business Combinations. 
The pro forma net revenues and net loss exclude the impact from negative goodwill recognized from the acquisition of 
the Credit Suisse Group of USD 27.7bn and certain items recognized by the Credit Suisse Group in 2023 prior to the 
acquisition date, including a gain from the write-down of additional tier 1 (AT1) capital notes of USD 16.4bn, a goodwill 
impairment charge, mostly related to Wealth Management (Credit Suisse), of USD 1.4bn and a gain from the reversal of 
contingent compensation award accruals of USD 0.4bn. These items are considered non-recurring and therefore not 
representative of the normal course of business. 
The pro forma net revenues and net loss do not purport to represent what UBS’s actual results of operations would have 
been had the transaction occurred on the date indicated, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results of operations. 
The pro forma net revenues and net loss also do not consider any potential impacts of current market conditions on 
revenues, assets or liabilities. Nor do they reflect expense efficiencies, asset dispositions or business reorganizations that 
are or may be contemplated, or any cost or revenue synergies, including further potential restructuring actions, associated 
with the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. 
Segment reporting – integration of UBS’s and Credit Suisse’s businesses and establishment of Non-core and 
Legacy 
Prior to the third quarter of 2023, UBS’s businesses were organized globally into four business divisions (Global Wealth 
Management, Personal & Corporate Banking, Asset Management and the Investment Bank), each qualifying as a 
reportable segment, and Group Functions. Credit Suisse’s businesses were organized globally into five reportable 
segments (Wealth Management (Credit Suisse), Swiss Bank (Credit Suisse), Asset Management (Credit Suisse), the 
Investment Bank (Credit Suisse) and the Capital Release Unit (Credit Suisse)), and the Corporate Center (Credit Suisse). 
As the integration of the UBS and Credit Suisse businesses continues, beginning with the third quarter of 2023, the 
Group reports five business divisions, each of which qualify as a reportable segment: Global Wealth Management, 
Personal & Corporate Banking, Asset Management, the Investment Bank, and Non-core and Legacy. 
Non-core and Legacy includes positions and businesses not aligned with the Group’s strategy and policies. Those consist 
of the assets and liabilities reported as part of the former Capital Release Unit (Credit Suisse) and certain assets and 
liabilities of the former Investment Bank (Credit Suisse), Wealth Management (Credit Suisse), Swiss Bank (Credit Suisse) 
and Asset Management (Credit Suisse) divisions, as well as of the former Corporate Center (Credit Suisse). Also included 
are the remaining assets and liabilities of UBS’s Non-core and Legacy Portfolio, previously reported in Group Functions, 
and smaller amounts of assets and liabilities of UBS’s business divisions that have been assessed as not strategic in light 
of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
Group Functions has been renamed Group Items and excludes UBS’s former Non-core and Legacy Portfolio and includes 
certain of the assets and liabilities of the former Corporate Center (Credit Suisse).
The above reflects how financial information is presented effective from the third quarter of 2023 in the internal 
management reports to the Group Executive Board, which is considered the “chief operating decision-maker” pursuant 
to IFRS 8, Operating Segments. 
Information for prior periods has been revised and presents Non-core and Legacy separately from Group Items.
As UBS executes its integration plans, the expectation is that allocation methodologies for profit and loss and balance 
sheet to the business divisions and into Group Items will continue to be reviewed and refined.

Pre-existing relationships 
As of 12 June 2023, UBS had the following pre-existing relationships with the Credit Suisse Group. 
USD m
Cash collateral receivables on derivative instruments 7
Derivative financial instruments 1,476
Debt instruments issued by the Credit Suisse Group and held by UBS 98

Such balances are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Retention awards of approximately USD 0.5bn were offered to selected employees of the Credit Suisse Group prior to 
the acquisition date to support the completion of the transaction and the early phase of integration. These awards were 
contingent on the completion of the acquisition and are delivered 50% in cash (in general vesting 60 days from the 
completion of the acquisition) and 50% in shares (in general vesting on the first anniversary of the completion of the 
acquisition). Vesting periods are longer for certain regulated employees. Expenses associated with these awards are 
recognized between the date of acquisition and the applicable vesting dates and were USD 0.3bn in 2023.
Note 3a Segment reporting
UBS’s businesses are organized globally into five business divisions: Global Wealth Management, Personal & Corporate 
Banking, Asset Management, the Investment Bank, and Non-core and Legacy. All five business divisions are supported 
by Group Items and qualify as reportable segments for the purpose of segment reporting. Together with Group Items, 
the five business divisions reflect the management structure of the Group.

– Non-core and Legacy includes positions and businesses not aligned with the Group’s strategy and policies. Those 
consist of the assets and liabilities that prior to the acquisition were reported as part of the Capital Release Unit (Credit 
Suisse) and certain assets and liabilities of the Investment Bank (Credit Suisse), Wealth Management (Credit Suisse), 
Swiss Bank (Credit Suisse) and Asset Management (Credit Suisse) divisions, as well as of the Corporate Center (Credit 
Suisse). Also included are the remaining assets and liabilities of UBS’s Non-core and Legacy Portfolio, previously 
reported in Group Functions (now renamed to Group Items), and smaller amounts of assets and liabilities of UBS’s 
business divisions that have been assessed as not strategic in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
– Our Group functions are support and control functions that provide services to the Group. Virtually all costs incurred 
by the support and control functions are allocated to the business divisions, leaving a residual amount that we refer 
to as Group Items in our segment reporting. Group functions is made up of the following major areas: Group Services 
(which consists of the Group Operations and Technology Office, Corporate Services, Compliance, Regulatory & 
Governance, Finance, Risk Control, Human Resources, Communications & Branding, Legal, the Group Integration 
Office, Group Sustainability and Impact, and Chief Strategy Office) and Group Treasury.
Financial information about the five business divisions and Group Items is presented separately in internal management 
reports to the Group Executive Board (the GEB), which is considered the “chief operating decision-maker” pursuant to 
IFRS 8, Operating Segments.

Note 3a Segment reporting (continued)
UBS’s internal accounting policies, which include management accounting policies and service level agreements, 
determine the revenues and expenses directly attributable to each reportable segment. Transactions between the 
reportable segments are carried out at internally agreed rates and are reflected in the operating results of the reportable 
segments. Revenue-sharing agreements are used to allocate external client revenues to reportable segments where 
several reportable segments are involved in the value creation chain. Total intersegment revenues for the Group are 
immaterial, as the majority of the revenues are allocated across the segments by means of revenue-sharing agreements. 
Interest income earned from managing UBS’s consolidated equity is allocated to the reportable segments based on 
average attributed equity and currency composition. Assets and liabilities of the reportable segments are funded through 
and invested with Group functions, and the net interest margin is reflected in the results of each reportable segment.
Segment assets are based on a third-party view and do not include intercompany balances. This view is in line with 
internal reporting to the GEB. If one operating segment is involved in an external transaction together with another 
operating segment or Group function, additional criteria are considered to determine the segment that will report the 
associated assets. This will include a consideration of which segment’s business needs are being addressed by the 
transaction and which segment is providing the funding and / or resources. Allocation of liabilities follows the same 
principles.
Non-current assets disclosed for segment reporting purposes represent assets that are expected to be recovered more 
than 12 months after the reporting date, excluding financial instruments, deferred tax assets and post-employment 
benefits.

periods have been revised to reflect these changes. 2 Negative goodwill arising from the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group is not allocated to the business divisions, as it relates to the Group. For further details, 
refer to Note 2. 3 Non-current assets acquired with the Credit Suisse Group are included in additions to non-current assets. Refer to Note 2 for more information about the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. 
4 Includes an USD 848m gain in Asset Management related to the sale of UBS‘s shareholding in Mitsubishi Corp.-UBS Realty Inc. 5 During 2022, UBS refined the methodology applied to allocate balance sheet 
resources from Group Items to the business divisions, with prospective effect. If the new methodology had been applied as of 31 December 2021, balance sheet assets allocated to business divisions would have been 
USD 26bn higher, of which USD 14bn would have related to the Investment Bank.

Note 3b Segment reporting by geographic location
The operating regions shown in the table below correspond to the regional management structure of the Group. The 
geographic analysis of non-current assets is based on the location of the entity in which the given assets are recorded.
The allocation of total revenues by geographical region for the Credit Suisse sub-group is not available on the same 
allocation basis as for the UBS Group for 2023 and the cost to develop this information would be excessive, therefore, 
as permitted under IFRS 8, the respective information is not disclosed. UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG disclose total 
revenues by geographical region in their annual reports according to their respective allocation methodologies.

Income tax recognized in the income statement
The Swiss current tax expenses related to taxable profits of UBS Switzerland AG and other Swiss entities.
The Swiss deferred tax expenses primarily related to the amortization of deferred tax assets (DTAs), as deductions related 
to temporary differences were made against profits.
The non-Swiss current tax expenses related to expenses of USD 100m in respect of US corporate alternative minimum 
tax (CAMT) and USD 584m in respect of other taxable profits of non-Swiss subsidiaries and branches.
The non-Swiss net deferred tax benefit primarily related to a benefit of USD 754m in respect of remeasurements of DTAs, 
which included USD 480m in respect of net upward revaluations of DTAs for certain entities in connection with the 
Group’s business planning process and USD 274m in respect of an increase in DTAs that resulted from an increase in the 
expected value of future tax deductions for deferred compensation awards due to an increase in the Group’s share price 
during the year. In addition, the net deferred tax benefit also included a benefit of USD 100m in respect of the recognition 
of DTAs for tax credits carried forward in respect of CAMT, which was partly offset by a net deferred tax expense of 
USD 8m.
The low effective tax rate for the year of 3.0% primarily reflected that the negative goodwill gain that was recorded in 
the income statement did not result in any tax expense, as well as the aforementioned tax benefit of USD 754m in respect 
of the remeasurement of DTAs. However, these benefits were partly offset by the impact of operating losses that were 
incurred by certain entities, reflecting integration-related expenses and restructuring costs, that did not result in any tax 
benefits because they cannot be offset with profits of other group entities and they did not result in any DTA recognition. 
If further such operating losses are incurred in 2024, the Group’s tax expense for the year may be significantly higher 
than the Group’s structural rate of 23%, but the Group’s effective tax rate is expected to decrease towards the structural 
rate in subsequent years, as such losses decrease.

1 The reconciling item for non-taxable and lower-taxed income for 2023 primarily reflects that the negative goodwill gain that was recorded in the income statement in relation to the acquisition of Credit Suisse did 
not result in any tax expense.
The components of operating profit before tax, and the differences between income tax expense reflected in the financial 
statements and the amounts calculated at the Swiss tax rate, are provided in the table above and explained below.
Component Description
Non-Swiss tax rates 
differing from the 
Swiss tax rate
To the extent that Group profits or losses arise outside Switzerland, the applicable local tax rate may differ from the Swiss 
tax rate. This item reflects, for such profits, an adjustment from the tax expense that would arise at the Swiss tax rate to 
the tax expense that would arise at the applicable local tax rate. Similarly, it reflects, for such losses, an adjustment from 
the tax benefit that would arise at the Swiss tax rate to the tax benefit that would arise at the applicable local tax rate.
Tax effects of losses 
not recognized
This item relates to tax losses of entities arising in the year that are not recognized as DTAs and where no tax benefit arises 
in relation to those losses. Therefore, the tax benefit calculated by applying the local tax rate to those losses as described 
above is reversed.
Previously 
unrecognized tax losses 
now utilized
This item relates to taxable profits of the year that are offset by tax losses of previous years for which no DTAs were 
previously recorded. Consequently, no current tax or deferred tax expense arises in relation to those taxable profits and 
the tax expense calculated by applying the local tax rate on those profits is reversed.
Non-taxable and lowertaxed income
This item relates to tax deductions for the year in respect of permanent differences. These include deductions in respect of 
profits that are either not taxable or are taxable at a lower rate of tax than the local tax rate. They also include deductions 
made for tax purposes, which are not reflected in the accounts.
Non-deductible 
expenses and 
additional taxable 
income
This item relates to additional taxable income for the year in respect of permanent differences. These include income that 
is recognized for tax purposes by an entity but is not included in its profit that is reported in the financial statements, as 
well as expenses for the year that are non-deductible (e.g., client entertainment costs are not deductible in certain 
locations).
Adjustments related to 
prior years, current tax
This item relates to adjustments to current tax expense for prior years (e.g., if the tax payable for a year is agreed with the 
tax authorities in an amount that differs from the amount previously reflected in the financial statements).
Adjustments related to 
prior years, deferred 
tax
This item relates to adjustments to deferred tax positions recognized in prior years (e.g., if a tax loss for a year is fully 
recognized and the amount of the tax loss agreed with the tax authorities is expected to differ from the amount previously 
recognized as DTAs in the accounts).
Change in deferred tax 
recognition
This item relates to changes in DTAs, including changes in DTAs previously recognized resulting from reassessments of 
expected future taxable profits. It also includes changes in temporary differences in the year, for which deferred tax is not 
recognized.
Adjustments to 
deferred tax balances 
arising from changes in 
tax rates
This item relates to remeasurements of DTAs and liabilities recognized due to changes in tax rates. These have the effect 
of changing the future tax saving that is expected from tax losses or deductible tax differences and therefore the amount 
of DTAs recognized or, alternatively, changing the tax cost of additional taxable income from taxable temporary 
differences and therefore the deferred tax liability.
Other items Other items include other differences between profits or losses at the local tax rate and the actual local tax expense or 
benefit, including movements in provisions for uncertain positions in relation to the current year and other items.
Income tax recognized directly in equity
A net tax expense of USD 314m was recognized in Other comprehensive income (2022: net benefit of USD 1,116m) and 
a net tax benefit of USD 19m was recognized in Share premium (2022: net benefit of USD 13m).

Note 9 Income taxes (continued)
Deferred tax assets and liabilities
The Group has gross DTAs, valuation allowances and recognized DTAs related to tax loss carry-forwards and deductible 
temporary differences, as well as deferred tax liabilities in respect of taxable temporary differences, as shown in the table 
below. The valuation allowances reflect DTAs that were not recognized because, as of the last remeasurement period, 
management did not consider it probable that there would be sufficient future taxable profits available to utilize the 
related tax loss carry-forwards and deductible temporary differences.
The recognition of DTAs is supported by forecasts of taxable profits for the entities concerned. In addition, tax planning 
opportunities are available that would result in additional future taxable income and these would be utilized, if necessary.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized in respect of investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in 
joint arrangements, except to the extent that the Group can control the timing of the reversal of the associated taxable 
temporary difference and it is probable that such will not reverse in the foreseeable future. However, as of 31 December 
2023, this exception was not considered to apply to any taxable temporary differences.

year.
In general, US federal tax losses incurred prior to 31 December 2017 can be carried forward for 20 years. US federal tax 
losses incurred after that date can be carried forward indefinitely, although the utilization of such losses is limited to 80% 
of the entity’s future year taxable profits. UK tax losses can also be carried forward indefinitely; they can shelter up to 
either 25% or 50% of future year taxable profits, depending on when the tax losses arose. The amounts of US tax loss 
carry-forwards that are included in the table below are based on their amount for federal tax purposes rather than for 
state and local tax purposes.

Note 10 Financial assets at amortized cost and other positions in scope of expected credit loss measurement 
(continued)
Coverage ratios are calculated for the core loan portfolio by taking ECL allowances and provisions divided by the gross 
carrying amount of the exposures. Core loan exposure is defined as the sum of Loans and advances to customers and 
Loans to financial advisors. 
These ratios are influenced by the following key factors: 
– Lombard loans are generally secured with marketable securities in portfolios that are, as a rule, highly diversified, with 
strict lending policies that are intended to ensure that credit risk is minimal under most circumstances; 
– mortgage loans to private clients and real estate financing are controlled by conservative eligibility criteria, including 
low loan-to-value ratios and strong debt service capabilities;
– the amount of unsecured retail lending (including credit cards and consumer financing) is not material; 
– lending in Switzerland includes government-backed COVID-19 loans;
– contractual maturities in the loan portfolio, which are a factor in the calculation of ECLs, are generally short, with 
Lombard lending typically having average contractual maturities of 12 months or less, real estate lending generally 
between two and three years in Switzerland, with long dated maturities in the US, and corporate lending between 
one and two years with related loan commitments up to four years; and 
– write-offs of ECL allowances against the gross loan balances when all or part of a financial asset is deemed uncollectible 
or forgiven, reduces the coverage ratios.
The total combined on- and off-balance sheet coverage ratio was 22 basis points as of 31 December 2023, 1 basis point 
higher than on 31 December 2022. The combined stage 1 and 2 ratio of 11 basis points, 1 basis point higher than on 
31 December 2022; the stage 3 ratio was 21%, 1 percentage point lower than as of 31 December 2022, and the PCI 
ratio was 7%.

Note 11 Derivative instruments
Overview
Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts are usually traded under a standardized International Swaps and Derivatives 
Association (ISDA) master agreement or other recognized local industry-standard master agreements between UBS and 
its counterparties. Terms are negotiated directly with counterparties and the contracts have industry-standard settlement 
mechanisms prescribed by ISDA or similar industry-standard solutions. Other OTC derivatives are cleared through clearing 
houses, in particular interest rate swaps with LCH, where a settled-to-market method has been generally adopted, under 
which cash collateral exchanged on a daily basis is considered to legally settle the market value of the derivatives. 
Regulators in various jurisdictions have introduced rules requiring the payment and collection of initial and variation 
margins on certain OTC derivative contracts, which may have a bearing on price and other relevant terms.
Exchange-traded derivatives (ETD) are standardized in terms of their amounts and settlement dates, and are bought and 
sold on regulated exchanges. Exchanges offer the benefits of pricing transparency, standardized daily settlement of 
changes in value and, consequently, reduced credit risk.
Most of the Group’s derivative transactions relate to sales and market-making activity. Sales activities include the 
structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current 
or expected risks. Market-making aims to directly support the facilitation and execution of client activity, and involves 
quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants with the aim of generating revenues based on spread and 
volume. The Group also uses various derivative instruments for hedging purposes.

Note 11 Derivative instruments (continued)
Risks of derivative instruments
The derivative financial assets shown on the balance sheet can be an important component of the Group’s credit 
exposure; however, the positive replacement values related to a respective counterparty are rarely an adequate reflection 
of the Group’s credit exposure in its derivatives business with that counterparty. This is generally the case because, on 
the one hand, replacement values can increase over time (potential future exposure), while, on the other hand, exposure 
may be mitigated by entering into master netting agreements and bilateral collateral arrangements. Both the exposure 
measures used internally by the Group to control credit risk and the capital requirements imposed by regulators reflect 
these additional factors.

Note 13 Goodwill and intangible assets
Introduction
UBS performs an impairment test on its goodwill assets on an annual basis or when indicators of impairment exist. 
UBS considers Asset Management, as reported in Note 3a, as a separate cash-generating unit (a CGU), as that is the level 
at which the performance of investment (and the related goodwill) is reviewed and assessed by management. Given that 
a significant amount of goodwill in Global Wealth Management relates to the acquisition of PaineWebber Group, Inc. in 
2000, which mainly affected the Americas portion of the business, this goodwill remains separately monitored by the 
Americas, despite the formation of Global Wealth Management in 2018. Therefore, goodwill for Global Wealth 
Management is separately considered for impairment at the level of two CGUs: Americas; and Switzerland and 
International (consisting of EMEA, Asia Pacific and Global).
The impairment test is performed for each CGU to which goodwill is allocated by comparing the recoverable amount 
with the carrying amount of the respective CGU. UBS determines the recoverable amount of the respective CGUs based 
on their value in use. An impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in 2023 resulted in negative goodwill, which was recognized in the income 
statement on the date of the acquisition. No goodwill related to the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group was recognized 
on the balance sheet.
› Refer to Note 2 for more information about the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 329
Note 13 Goodwill and intangible assets (continued)
As of 31 December 2023, total goodwill recognized on the balance sheet was USD 6.0bn, of which USD 3.7bn was 
carried by the Global Wealth Management Americas CGU, USD 1.2bn was carried by the Global Wealth Management 
Switzerland and International CGU, and USD 1.1bn was carried by Asset Management. Based on the impairment testing 
methodology described below, UBS concluded that the goodwill balances as of 31 December 2023 allocated to these 
CGUs were not impaired. For each of the CGUs, the recoverable amount substantially exceeded the carrying value as of 
31 December 2023 and there was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on the testing 
performed as of 31 December 2023.
Methodology for goodwill impairment testing
The recoverable amounts are determined using a discounted cash flow model, which has been adapted to use inputs 
that consider features of the banking business and its regulatory environment. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the 
sum of the discounted earnings attributable to shareholders from the first three forecast years and the terminal value, 
adjusted for the effect of the capital assumed to be needed over the next three years and to support growth beyond that 
period. The terminal value, which covers all periods beyond the third year, is calculated on the basis of the forecast of 
the third-year profit, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate, as well as the implied perpetual capital growth. 
For the Global Wealth Management Americas CGU, the methodology is consistently applied, however, the forecast 
period was extended from three to five years (with a terminal value thereafter) in 2023 to provide for the CGU’s specific 
planning assumptions, namely the ongoing investments in the core banking infrastructure in the US to enhance the 
product capabilities and offerings in this market in the mid-term. The extension of the forecast period from three to five 
years did not trigger, defer or avoid an impairment of goodwill as of 31 December 2023.
The carrying amount for each CGU is determined by reference to the Group’s equity attribution framework. Within this 
framework, UBS attributes equity to the businesses on the basis of their risk-weighted assets and leverage ratio 
denominator (both metrics include resource allocations from Group Items to the business divisions), their goodwill and 
their intangible assets, as well as attributed equity related to certain common equity tier 1 deduction items. The 
framework is primarily used for the purpose of measuring the performance of the businesses and includes certain 
management assumptions. Attributed equity is equal to the capital a CGU requires to conduct its business and is currently 
considered a reasonable approximation of the carrying amount of the CGUs. The attributed equity methodology is also 
applied in the business planning process, the inputs from which are used in calculating the recoverable amounts of the 
respective CGU.
Assumptions
Valuation parameters used within the Group’s impairment test model are linked to external market information, where 
applicable. The model used to determine the recoverable amount is most sensitive to changes in the forecast earnings 
available to shareholders in years one to three, to changes in the discount rates and to changes in the long-term growth 
rate. The applied long-term growth rate is based on long-term economic growth rates for different regions worldwide. 
Earnings available to shareholders are estimated on the basis of forecast results, which are part of the business plan 
approved by the Board of Directors.
The discount rates are determined by applying a capital asset pricing model-based approach, as well as considering 
quantitative and qualitative inputs from both internal and external analysts and the view of management. They also take 
into account regional differences in risk-free rates at the level of the individual CGUs. In line with discount rates, longterm growth rates are determined at the regional level based on nominal GDP growth rate forecasts.
Key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of each CGU are tested for sensitivity by applying a 
reasonably possible change to those assumptions. Forecast earnings available to shareholders were changed by 20%, 
the discount rates were changed by 1.5 percentage points, and the long-term growth rates were changed by 
0.75 percentage points. Under all scenarios, reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not result in an 
impairment of goodwill or intangible assets reported by Global Wealth Management Americas, Global Wealth 
Management Switzerland and International, and Asset Management. 
If the estimated earnings and other assumptions in future periods deviate from the current outlook, the value of goodwill 
attributable to Global Wealth Management Americas, Global Wealth Management Switzerland and International, and 
Asset Management may become impaired in the future, giving rise to losses in the income statement. Recognition of any 
impairment of goodwill would reduce IFRS Accounting Standards equity and net profit. It would not affect cash flows 
and, as goodwill is required to be deducted from capital under the Basel III capital framework, no effect would be 
expected on the Group’s capital ratios.

Effective from 1 April 2022, UBS has reclassified a portfolio of financial assets from Financial assets measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income with a fair value of USD 6.9bn (the Portfolio) to Other financial assets measured at 
amortized cost. 
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 331
Note 14 Other assets (continued)
The Portfolio’s cumulative fair value losses of USD 449m pre-tax and USD 333m post-tax, previously recognized in Other 
comprehensive income, have been removed from equity and adjusted against the value of the assets on the 
reclassification date, so that the Portfolio is measured as if the assets had always been classified at amortized cost, with 
a value of USD 7.4bn as on 1 April 2022. The reclassification had no effect on the income statement. The reclassified 
Portfolio is made up of high-quality liquid assets, primarily US government treasuries and US government agency 
mortgage-backed securities, held and separately managed by UBS Bank USA. The accounting reclassification has arisen 
as a direct result of the transformation of UBS’s Global Wealth Management Americas business, which has significantly 
impacted UBS Bank USA. This includes initiatives approved by the Group Executive Board to significantly grow and extend 
the business, as disclosed on 1 February 2022 during UBS’s fourth quarter 2021 earnings presentation. Over the two 
years preceding the reclassification date, UBS Bank USA’s deposit base grew by more than 100% generating substantial 
cash balances, with a number of new products being launched, including new deposit types that are longer in duration, 
additional lending and a broader range of customer segments targeted. Following the commencement of these activities 
and the announcement made in the first quarter of 2022, the Portfolio is no longer held in a business model to collect 
the contractual cash flows and sell the assets but is instead solely held to collect the contractual cash flows until the 
assets mature, requiring a reclassification of the Portfolio in line with IFRS 9 with effect from 1 April 2022.

The Group uses interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to manage the risks inherent in certain debt instruments 
held at amortized cost. In some cases, the Group applies hedge accounting for interest rate risk as discussed in item 2j 
in Note 1a and Note 26. As a result of applying hedge accounting, the life-to-date adjustment to the carrying amount of 
debt issued was a decrease of USD 3.0bn as of 31 December 2023 and a decrease of USD 6.1bn as of 31 December 
2022, reflecting changes in fair value due to interest rate movements.
Subordinated debt consists of unsecured debt obligations that are contractually subordinated in right of payment to all 
other present and future non-subordinated obligations of the respective issuing entity. Materially all the subordinated 
debt instruments outstanding as of 31 December 2023 pay a fixed rate of interest.

Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 333
Note 18 Provisions and contingent liabilities (continued)
Restructuring provisions relate to onerous contracts for property and personnel-related provisions. Onerous contracts for 
property are recognized when UBS is committed to pay for non-lease components, such as utilities, service charges, taxes 
and maintenance, when a property is vacated or not fully recovered from sub-tenants. Personnel-related restructuring 
provisions are generally used within a short period of time. The level of personnel-related provisions can change when 
natural staff attrition reduces the number of people affected by a restructuring event, and therefore results in lower 
estimated costs.
Other provisions mainly include provisions related to onerous contracts, employee benefits and operational risks. Onerous 
contracts are recognized for certain contractual arrangements where the costs exceed the economic benefits expected 
to be received.
Information about provisions and contingent liabilities in respect of litigation, regulatory and similar matters, as a class, 
is included in Note 18b. There are no material contingent liabilities associated with the other classes of provisions.
b) Litigation, regulatory and similar matters
The Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to significant litigation and similar risks arising 
from disputes and regulatory proceedings. As a result, UBS (which for purposes of this Note may refer to UBS Group AG 
and/or one or more of its subsidiaries, as applicable) is involved in various disputes and legal proceedings, including 
litigation, arbitration, and regulatory and criminal investigations.
Such matters are subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome and the timing of resolution are often difficult to predict, 
particularly in the earlier stages of a case. There are also situations where the Group may enter into a settlement agreement. 
This may occur in order to avoid the expense, management distraction or reputational implications of continuing to contest 
liability, even for those matters for which the Group believes it should be exonerated. The uncertainties inherent in all such 
matters affect the amount and timing of any potential outflows for both matters with respect to which provisions have 
been established and other contingent liabilities. The Group makes provisions for such matters brought against it when, in 
the opinion of management after seeking legal advice, it is more likely than not that the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required, and the amount 
can be reliably estimated. Where these factors are otherwise satisfied, a provision may be established for claims that have 
not yet been asserted against the Group, but are nevertheless expected to be, based on the Group’s experience with similar 
asserted claims. If any of those conditions is not met, such matters result in contingent liabilities. If the amount of an 
obligation cannot be reliably estimated, a liability exists that is not recognized even if an outflow of resources is probable. 
Accordingly, no provision is established even if the potential outflow of resources with respect to such matters could be 
significant. Developments relating to a matter that occur after the relevant reporting period, but prior to the issuance of 
financial statements, which affect management’s assessment of the provision for such matter (because, for example, the 
developments provide evidence of conditions that existed at the end of the reporting period), are adjusting events after the 
reporting period under IAS 10 and must be recognized in the financial statements for the reporting period.
Specific litigation, regulatory and other matters are described below, including all such matters that management 
considers to be material and others that management believes to be of significance to the Group due to potential 
financial, reputational and other effects. The amount of damages claimed, the size of a transaction or other information 
is provided where available and appropriate in order to assist users in considering the magnitude of potential exposures.
In the case of certain matters below, we state that we have established a provision, and for the other matters, we make 
no such statement. When we make this statement and we expect disclosure of the amount of a provision to prejudice 
seriously our position with other parties in the matter because it would reveal what UBS believes to be the probable and 
reliably estimable outflow, we do not disclose that amount. In some cases we are subject to confidentiality obligations 
that preclude such disclosure. With respect to the matters for which we do not state whether we have established a 
provision, either: (a) we have not established a provision; or (b) we have established a provision but expect disclosure of 
that fact to prejudice seriously our position with other parties in the matter because it would reveal the fact that UBS 
believes an outflow of resources to be probable and reliably estimable.
With respect to certain litigation, regulatory and similar matters for which we have established provisions, we are able to 
estimate the expected timing of outflows. However, the aggregate amount of the expected outflows for those matters 
for which we are able to estimate expected timing is immaterial relative to our current and expected levels of liquidity 
over the relevant time periods.
The aggregate amount provisioned for litigation, regulatory and similar matters as a class is disclosed in the “Provisions” 
table in Note 18a above. It is not practicable to provide an aggregate estimate of liability for our litigation, regulatory 
and similar matters as a class of contingent liabilities beyond what has been identified as a consequence of the acquisition 
of Credit Suisse as set out below. Doing so would require UBS to provide speculative legal assessments as to claims and 
proceedings that involve unique fact patterns or novel legal theories, that have not yet been initiated or are at early stages 
of adjudication, or as to which alleged damages have not been quantified by the claimants. Although UBS therefore 
cannot provide a numerical estimate of the future losses that could arise from litigation, regulatory and similar matters, 
UBS believes that the aggregate amount of possible future losses from this class that are more than remote substantially 
exceeds the level of current provisions. 
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 334
Note 18 Provisions and contingent liabilities (continued)
Litigation, regulatory and similar matters may also result in non-monetary penalties and consequences. A guilty plea to, 
or conviction of, a crime could have material consequences for UBS. Resolution of regulatory proceedings may require 
UBS to obtain waivers of regulatory disqualifications to maintain certain operations, may entitle regulatory authorities to 
limit, suspend or terminate licenses and regulatory authorizations, and may permit financial market utilities to limit, 
suspend or terminate UBS’s participation in such utilities. Failure to obtain such waivers, or any limitation, suspension or 
termination of licenses, authorizations or participations, could have material consequences for UBS.
The risk of loss associated with litigation, regulatory and similar matters is a component of operational risk for purposes 
of determining capital requirements. Information concerning our capital requirements and the calculation of operational 
risk for this purpose is included in the “Capital, liquidity and funding, and balance sheet” section of this report.
Matters related to Credit Suisse entities are separately described herein. The amounts shown in the table below reflect 
the provisions recorded under IFRS Accounting Standards accounting principles. In connection with the acquisition of 
Credit Suisse, UBS Group AG additionally has reflected in its purchase accounting under IFRS 3 a further valuation 
adjustment of USD 3.8bn reflecting an updated estimate of outflows relating to contingent liabilities for all present 
obligations included in the scope of the acquisition at fair value upon closing, even if it is not probable that they will 
result in an outflow of resources, significantly decreasing the recognition threshold for litigation liabilities beyond those 
that generally apply under IFRS Accounting Standards and US GAAP. 
Provisions used in conformity with designated purpose include USD 1.4bn recorded in Non-core and Legacy from the 
settlement of the action by the DOJ under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 
related to UBS’s issuance, underwriting and sale of US residential mortgage-backed securities in 2006 and 2007.

A. Litigation, regulatory and similar matters involving UBS AG and subsidiaries
1. Inquiries regarding cross-border wealth management businesses 
Tax and regulatory authorities in a number of countries have made inquiries, served requests for information or examined 
employees located in their respective jurisdictions relating to the cross-border wealth management services provided by 
UBS and other financial institutions.
Since 2013, UBS (France) S.A., UBS AG and certain former employees have been under investigation in France in relation 
to UBS’s cross-border business with French clients. In connection with this investigation, the investigating judges ordered 
UBS AG to provide bail (“caution”) of EUR 1.1bn.
In 2019, the court of first instance returned a verdict finding UBS AG guilty of unlawful solicitation of clients on French 
territory and aggravated laundering of the proceeds of tax fraud, and UBS (France) S.A. guilty of aiding and abetting 
unlawful solicitation and of laundering the proceeds of tax fraud. The court imposed fines aggregating EUR 3.7bn on 
UBS AG and UBS (France) S.A. and awarded EUR 800m of civil damages to the French state. A trial in the Paris Court of 
Appeal took place in March 2021. In December 2021, the Court of Appeal found UBS AG guilty of unlawful solicitation 
and aggravated laundering of the proceeds of tax fraud. The court ordered a fine of EUR 3.75m, the confiscation of EUR 
1bn, and awarded civil damages to the French state of EUR 800m. UBS appealed the decision to the French Supreme 
Court. The Supreme Court rendered its judgment on 15 November 2023. It upheld the Court of Appeal‘s decision 
regarding unlawful solicitation and aggravated laundering of the proceeds of tax fraud, but overturned the confiscation 
of EUR 1bn, the penalty of EUR 3.75m and the EUR 800m of civil damages awarded to the French state. The case has 
been remanded to the Court of Appeal for a retrial regarding these overturned elements. The French state has reimbursed 
the EUR 800m of civil damages to UBS AG.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 335
Note 18 Provisions and contingent liabilities (continued)
Our balance sheet at 31 December 2023 reflected a provision in an amount that UBS believes to be appropriate under 
the applicable accounting standard. As in the case of other matters for which we have established provisions, the future 
outflow of resources in respect of such matters cannot be determined with certainty based on currently available 
information and accordingly may ultimately prove to be substantially greater (or may be less) than the provision that we 
have recognized.
2. Madoff
In relation to the Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (BMIS) investment fraud, UBS AG, UBS (Luxembourg) S.A. 
(now UBS Europe SE, Luxembourg branch) and certain other UBS subsidiaries have been subject to inquiries by a number 
of regulators, including the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) and the Luxembourg Commission de 
Surveillance du Secteur Financier. Those inquiries concerned two third-party funds established under Luxembourg law, 
substantially all assets of which were with BMIS, as well as certain funds established in offshore jurisdictions with either 
direct or indirect exposure to BMIS. These funds faced severe losses, and the Luxembourg funds are in liquidation. The 
documentation establishing both funds identifies UBS entities in various roles, including custodian, administrator, 
manager, distributor and promoter, and indicates that UBS employees serve as board members.
In 2009 and 2010, the liquidators of the two Luxembourg funds filed claims against UBS entities, non-UBS entities and 
certain individuals, including current and former UBS employees, seeking amounts totaling approximately EUR 2.1bn, 
which includes amounts that the funds may be held liable to pay the trustee for the liquidation of BMIS (BMIS Trustee).
A large number of alleged beneficiaries have filed claims against UBS entities (and non-UBS entities) for purported losses 
relating to the Madoff fraud. The majority of these cases have been filed in Luxembourg, where decisions that the claims 
in eight test cases were inadmissible have been affirmed by the Luxembourg Court of Appeal, and the Luxembourg 
Supreme Court has dismissed a further appeal in one of the test cases.
In the US, the BMIS Trustee filed claims against UBS entities, among others, in relation to the two Luxembourg funds and 
one of the offshore funds. The total amount claimed against all defendants in these actions was not less than USD 2bn. 
In 2014, the US Supreme Court rejected the BMIS Trustee’s motion for leave to appeal decisions dismissing all claims 
except those for the recovery of approximately USD 125m of payments alleged to be fraudulent conveyances and 
preference payments. In 2016, the bankruptcy court dismissed these claims against the UBS entities. In 2019, the Court 
of Appeals reversed the dismissal of the BMIS Trustee’s remaining claims, and the US Supreme Court subsequently denied 
a petition seeking review of the Court of Appeals’ decision. The case has been remanded to the Bankruptcy Court for 
further proceedings.
3. Foreign exchange, LIBOR and benchmark rates, and other trading practices
Foreign exchange-related regulatory matters: Beginning in 2013, numerous authorities commenced investigations 
concerning possible manipulation of foreign exchange markets and precious metals prices. As a result of these 
investigations, UBS entered into resolutions with Swiss, US and United Kingdom regulators and the European 
Commission. UBS was granted conditional immunity by the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and by authorities in other 
jurisdictions in connection with potential competition law violations relating to foreign exchange and precious metals 
businesses.
Foreign exchange-related civil litigation: Putative class actions have been filed since 2013 in US federal courts and in other 
jurisdictions against UBS and other banks on behalf of putative classes of persons who engaged in foreign currency 
transactions with any of the defendant banks. UBS has resolved US federal court class actions relating to foreign currency 
transactions with the defendant banks and persons who transacted in foreign exchange futures contracts and options 
on such futures under a settlement agreement that provides for UBS to pay an aggregate of USD 141m and provide 
cooperation to the settlement classes. Certain class members have excluded themselves from that settlement and have 
filed individual actions in US and English courts against UBS and other banks, alleging violations of US and European 
competition laws and unjust enrichment. UBS and the other banks have resolved those individual matters.
In 2015, a putative class action was filed in federal court against UBS and numerous other banks on behalf of persons 
and businesses in the US who directly purchased foreign currency from the defendants and alleged co-conspirators for 
their own end use. In 2022, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. In March 2023, the court granted 
defendants’ summary judgment motion, dismissing the case. Plaintiffs have appealed.
LIBOR and other benchmark-related regulatory matters: Numerous government agencies conducted investigations 
regarding potential improper attempts by UBS, among others, to manipulate LIBOR and other benchmark rates at certain 
times. UBS reached settlements or otherwise concluded investigations relating to benchmark interest rates with the 
investigating authorities. UBS was granted conditional leniency or conditional immunity from authorities in certain 
jurisdictions, including the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and the Swiss Competition Commission (WEKO), in connection 
with potential antitrust or competition law violations related to certain rates. However, UBS has not reached a final 
settlement with WEKO, as the Secretariat of WEKO has asserted that UBS does not qualify for full immunity.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 336
Note 18 Provisions and contingent liabilities (continued)
LIBOR and other benchmark-related civil litigation: A number of putative class actions and other actions are pending in 
the federal courts in New York against UBS and numerous other banks on behalf of parties who transacted in certain 
interest rate benchmark-based derivatives. Also pending in the US and in other jurisdictions are a number of other actions 
asserting losses related to various products whose interest rates were linked to LIBOR and other benchmarks, including 
adjustable rate mortgages, preferred and debt securities, bonds pledged as collateral, loans, depository accounts, 
investments and other interest-bearing instruments. The complaints allege manipulation, through various means, of 
certain benchmark interest rates, including USD LIBOR, Euroyen TIBOR, Yen LIBOR, EURIBOR, CHF LIBOR, GBP LIBOR and 
seek unspecified compensatory and other damages under varying legal theories.
USD LIBOR class and individual actions in the US: In 2013 and 2015, the district court in the USD LIBOR actions dismissed, 
in whole or in part, certain plaintiffs’ antitrust claims, federal racketeering claims, Commodity Exchange Act claims, and 
state common law claims, and again dismissed the antitrust claims in 2016 following an appeal. In 2021, the Second 
Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal in part and reversed in part and remanded to the district court for further 
proceedings. The Second Circuit, among other things, held that there was personal jurisdiction over UBS and other 
foreign defendants. Separately, in 2018, the Second Circuit reversed in part the district court’s 2015 decision dismissing 
certain individual plaintiffs’ claims and certain of these actions are now proceeding. In 2018, the district court denied 
plaintiffs’ motions for class certification in the USD class actions for claims pending against UBS, and plaintiffs sought 
permission to appeal that ruling to the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit denied the petition to appeal. In 2020, an 
individual action was filed in the Northern District of California against UBS and numerous other banks alleging that the 
defendants conspired to fix the interest rate used as the basis for loans to consumers by jointly setting the USD LIBOR 
rate and monopolized the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In September 2022, the court 
granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety, while allowing plaintiffs the opportunity to file an 
amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in October 2022, and defendants moved to dismiss the 
amended complaint. In October 2023, the court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice. In January 2024, 
plaintiffs appealed the dismissal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Defendants filed their response to the appeal in 
March 2024.
Other benchmark class actions in the US: 
Yen LIBOR / Euroyen TIBOR – In 2017, the court dismissed one Yen LIBOR / Euroyen TIBOR action in its entirety on 
standing grounds. In 2020, the appeals court reversed the dismissal and, subsequently, plaintiffs in that action filed an 
amended complaint focused on Yen LIBOR. In 2022, the court granted UBS’s motion for reconsideration and dismissed 
the case against UBS. The dismissal of the case against UBS could be appealed following the disposition of the case 
against the remaining defendant in the district court.
CHF LIBOR – In 2017, the court dismissed the CHF LIBOR action on standing grounds and failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs 
filed an amended complaint, and the court granted a renewed motion to dismiss in 2019. Plaintiffs appealed. In 2021, 
the Second Circuit granted the parties’ joint motion to vacate the dismissal and remand the case for further proceedings. 
Plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint in November 2022 and defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint 
in January 2023.
EURIBOR – In 2017, the court in the EURIBOR lawsuit dismissed the case as to UBS and certain other foreign defendants 
for lack of personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs have appealed. 
GBP LIBOR – The court dismissed the GBP LIBOR action in 2019. Plaintiffs have appealed. 
Government bonds: Putative class actions have been filed since 2015 in US federal courts against UBS and other banks 
on behalf of persons who participated in markets for US Treasury securities since 2007. A consolidated complaint was 
filed in 2017 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the banks colluded with respect 
to, and manipulated prices of, US Treasury securities sold at auction and in the secondary market and asserting claims 
under the antitrust laws and for unjust enrichment. Defendants’ motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint were 
granted in 2021. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which defendants moved to dismiss later in 2021. In March 2022, 
the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss that complaint, and in February 2024, the Second Circuit affirmed the 
district court’s dismissal. Similar class actions have been filed concerning European government bonds and other 
government bonds.
In 2021, the European Commission issued a decision finding that UBS and six other banks breached European Union 
antitrust rules in 2007–2011 relating to European government bonds. The European Commission fined UBS EUR 172m. 
UBS is appealing the amount of the fine.
With respect to additional matters and jurisdictions not encompassed by the settlements and orders referred to above, 
our balance sheet at 31 December 2023 reflected a provision in an amount that UBS believes to be appropriate under 
the applicable accounting standard. As in the case of other matters for which we have established provisions, the future 
outflow of resources in respect of such matters cannot be determined with certainty based on currently available 
information and accordingly may ultimately prove to be substantially greater (or may be less) than the provision that we 
have recognized.

4. Swiss retrocessions
The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland ruled in 2012, in a test case against UBS, that distribution fees paid to a firm 
for distributing third-party and intra-group investment funds and structured products must be disclosed and surrendered 
to clients who have entered into a discretionary mandate agreement with the firm, absent a valid waiver. FINMA issued 
a supervisory note to all Swiss banks in response to the Supreme Court decision. UBS has met the FINMA requirements 
and has notified all potentially affected clients.
The Supreme Court decision has resulted, and continues to result, in a number of client requests for UBS to disclose and 
potentially surrender retrocessions. Client requests are assessed on a case-by-case basis. Considerations taken into 
account when assessing these cases include, among other things, the existence of a discretionary mandate and whether 
or not the client documentation contained a valid waiver with respect to distribution fees.
Our balance sheet at 31 December 2023 reflected a provision with respect to matters described in this item 4 in an 
amount that UBS believes to be appropriate under the applicable accounting standard. The ultimate exposure will depend 
on client requests and the resolution thereof, factors that are difficult to predict and assess. Hence, as in the case of other 
matters for which we have established provisions, the future outflow of resources in respect of such matters cannot be 
determined with certainty based on currently available information and accordingly may ultimately prove to be 
substantially greater (or may be less) than the provision that we have recognized.
B. Litigation regulatory and similar matters involving Credit Suisse entities
1. Mortgage-related matters
Government and regulatory related matters: DOJ RMBS settlement – In January 2017, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC 
(CSS LLC) and its current and former US subsidiaries and US affiliates reached a settlement with the US Department of 
Justice (DOJ) related to its legacy Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) business, a business conducted through 
2007. The settlement resolved potential civil claims by the DOJ related to certain of those Credit Suisse entities’ packaging, 
marketing, structuring, arrangement, underwriting, issuance and sale of RMBS. Pursuant to the terms of the settlement 
a civil monetary penalty was paid to the DOJ in January 2017. The settlement also required the Credit Suisse entities to 
provide certain levels of consumer relief measures, including affordable housing payments and loan forgiveness, and the 
DOJ and Credit Suisse agreed to the appointment of an independent monitor to oversee the completion of the consumer 
relief requirements of the settlement. Credit Suisse continues to evaluate its approach toward satisfying its remaining 
consumer relief obligations, and Credit Suisse currently anticipates that it will take much longer than the five-year period 
provided in the settlement to satisfy in full its obligations in respect of these consumer relief measures, subject to risk 
appetite and market conditions. Credit Suisse expects to incur costs in relation to satisfying those obligations. The amount 
of consumer relief Credit Suisse must provide also increases after 2021 pursuant to the original settlement by 5% per 
annum of the outstanding amount due until these obligations are settled. The monitor publishes reports periodically on 
these consumer relief matters.
Civil litigation: Repurchase litigations – CSS LLC and/or certain of its affiliates have also been named as defendants in 
various civil litigation matters related to their roles as issuer, sponsor, depositor, underwriter and/or servicer of RMBS 
transactions. These cases currently include repurchase actions by RMBS trusts and/or trustees, in which plaintiffs generally 
allege breached representations and warranties in respect of mortgage loans and failure to repurchase such mortgage 
loans as required under the applicable agreements. The amounts disclosed below do not reflect actual realized plaintiff 
losses to date or anticipated future litigation exposure. Unless otherwise stated, these amounts reflect the original unpaid 
principal balance amounts as alleged in these actions and do not include any reduction in principal amounts since 
issuance.
DLJ Mortgage Capital, Inc. (DLJ) is a defendant in New York state court in: (i) one action brought by Asset Backed 
Securities Corporation Home Equity Loan Trust, Series 2006-HE7, in which plaintiff alleges damages of not less than USD 
374m in an amended complaint filed in August 2019; in January 2020, DLJ filed a motion to dismiss, which the court 
granted in part and denied in part in December 2023, dismissing with prejudice all notice-based claims; in February 2024, 
the parties filed notices of appeal; (ii) one action brought by Home Equity Asset Trust, Series 2006-8, in which plaintiff 
alleges damages of not less than USD 436m; (iii) one action brought by Home Equity Asset Trust 2007-1, in which plaintiff 
alleges damages of not less than USD 420m; in December 2018, the court denied DLJ’s motion for partial summary 
judgment in this action, which was affirmed on appeal; in March 2022, the New York State Court of Appeals reversed 
the decision and ordered that DLJ’s motion for partial summary judgment be granted; a non-jury trial in the action was 
held between January and February 2023, and a decision is pending; (iv) one action brought by Home Equity Asset Trust 
2007-2, in which plaintiff alleges damages of not less than USD 495m; and (v) one action brought by CSMC AssetBacked Trust 2007-NC1, in which no damages amount is alleged. These actions are at various procedural stages. 
DLJ was also a defendant in one action brought by Home Equity Asset Trust Series 2007-3, in which plaintiff alleged 
damages of not less than USD 206m. In March 2022, DLJ and the plaintiff executed an agreement to settle this action. 
In November 2023, the Minnesota state court approved the settlement through a trust instruction proceeding brought 
by the trustee of the plaintiff trust. The New York state court dismissed the underlying action with prejudice in January 
2024.

2. Tax and securities law matters
In May 2014, Credit Suisse AG entered into settlement agreements with several US regulators regarding its US crossborder matters. As part of the agreements, Credit Suisse AG, among other things, engaged an independent corporate 
monitor that reports to the New York State Department of Financial Services. As of July 2018, the monitor concluded 
both his review and his assignment. Credit Suisse AG continues to report to and cooperate with US authorities in 
accordance with Credit Suisse AG’s obligations under the agreements, including by conducting a review of cross-border 
services provided by Credit Suisse’s Switzerland-based Israel Desk. Most recently, Credit Suisse AG has provided 
information to US authorities regarding potentially undeclared US assets held by clients at Credit Suisse AG since the May 
2014 plea. Credit Suisse AG continues to cooperate with the authorities. In March 2023, the US Senate Finance 
Committee issued a report criticizing Credit Suisse AG’s history regarding US tax compliance. The report called on the 
DOJ to investigate Credit Suisse AG’s compliance with the 2014 plea.
In February 2021, a qui tam complaint was filed in the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that Credit Suisse AG had 
violated the False Claims Act by failing to disclose all US accounts at the time of the 2014 plea, which allegedly allowed 
Credit Suisse AG to pay a criminal fine in 2014 that was purportedly lower than it should have been. The DOJ moved to 
dismiss the case, and the Court summarily dismissed the suit. The case is now on appeal with the US Federal Court of 
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
3. Rates-related matters
Regulatory matters: Regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions, including the US, UK, EU and Switzerland, have 
for an extended period of time been conducting investigations into the setting of LIBOR and other reference rates with 
respect to a number of currencies, as well as the pricing of certain related derivatives. These ongoing investigations have 
included information requests from regulators regarding LIBOR-setting practices and reviews of the activities of various 
financial institutions, including Credit Suisse Group AG, which was a member of three LIBOR rate-setting panels (US 
Dollar LIBOR, Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euro LIBOR). Credit Suisse is cooperating fully with these investigations.
Regulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions, including WEKO, the European Commission (Commission), the South 
African Competition Commission and the Brazilian Competition Authority have been conducting investigations into the 
trading activities, information sharing and the setting of benchmark rates in the foreign exchange (including electronic 
trading) markets. Credit Suisse continues to cooperate with ongoing investigations.
Credit Suisse Group AG, Credit Suisse AG and Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited (CSSEL) received a Statement of 
Objections and a Supplemental Statement of Objections from the Commission in July 2018 and March 2021, respectively, 
alleging that Credit Suisse entities engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with their foreign exchange trading 
business. In December 2021, the Commission issued a formal decision imposing a fine of EUR 83.3m. In February 2022, 
Credit Suisse appealed this decision to the EU General Court.
The reference rates investigations have also included information requests from regulators concerning supranational, 
sub-sovereign and agency (SSA) bonds and commodities markets. Credit Suisse Group AG and CSSEL received a 
Statement of Objections from the Commission in December 2018, alleging that Credit Suisse entities engaged in 
anticompetitive practices in connection with their SSA bonds trading business. In April 2021, the Commission issued a 
formal decision imposing a fine of EUR 11.9m. In July 2021, Credit Suisse appealed this decision to the EU General Court.
Civil litigation:
USD LIBOR litigation – Beginning in 2011, certain Credit Suisse entities were named in various putative class and individual 
lawsuits filed in the US, alleging banks on the US dollar LIBOR panel manipulated US dollar LIBOR to benefit their 
reputation and increase profits. All remaining matters have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes into a multi-district 
litigation in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY).
In a series of rulings between 2013 and 2019 on motions to dismiss, the SDNY (i) narrowed the claims against the Credit 
Suisse entities and the other defendants (dismissing antitrust, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 
Commodity Exchange Act, and state law claims), (ii) narrowed the set of plaintiffs who may bring claims, and (iii) 
narrowed the set of defendants in the LIBOR actions (including the dismissal of several Credit Suisse entities from various 
cases on personal jurisdiction and statute of limitation grounds). After a number of putative class and individual plaintiffs 
appealed the dismissal of their antitrust claims to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Second 
Circuit), in December 2021, the Second Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s decision and 
remanded the case to the SDNY.
Separately, in May 2017, the plaintiffs in three putative class actions moved for class certification. In February 2018, the 
SDNY denied certification in two of the actions and granted certification over a single antitrust claim in an action brought 
by over-the-counter purchasers of LIBOR-linked derivatives.

Note 18 Provisions and contingent liabilities (continued)
USD ICE LIBOR litigation – In August 2020, members of the ICE LIBOR panel, including Credit Suisse Group AG and 
certain of its affiliates, were named in a civil action in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging 
that panel banks manipulated ICE LIBOR to profit from variable interest loans and credit cards. In December 2021, the 
court denied plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary and permanent injunctions to enjoin panel banks from continuing to set 
LIBOR or automatically setting the benchmark to zero each day, and in September 2022, the court granted defendants’ 
motions to dismiss. In October 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In November 2022, defendants filed a motion 
to dismiss the amended complaint. In October 2023, the court dismissed the amended complaint with prejudice without 
leave to amend. Plaintiffs have appealed.
CHF LIBOR litigation – In February 2015, various banks that served on the Swiss franc LIBOR panel, including Credit Suisse 
Group AG, were named in a civil putative class action lawsuit filed in the SDNY, alleging manipulation of Swiss franc 
LIBOR to benefit defendants’ trading positions. After defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
was granted and plaintiffs successfully appealed, in July 2022, Credit Suisse entered into an agreement to settle all claims. 
In February and September 2023, respectively, the court entered orders granting preliminary and final approval to the 
agreement to settle all claims.
Foreign exchange litigation – Credit Suisse Group AG and affiliates as well as other financial institutions have been named 
in civil lawsuits relating to the alleged manipulation of foreign exchange rates.
Credit Suisse AG, together with other financial institutions, was named in a consolidated putative class action in Israel, 
which made allegations similar to the consolidated class action. In April 2022, Credit Suisse entered into an agreement 
to settle all claims. The settlement remains subject to court approval.
Treasury markets litigation – CSS LLC, along with over 20 other primary dealers of US treasury securities, was named in 
a number of putative civil class action complaints in the US relating to the US treasury markets. These complaints generally 
alleged that the defendants colluded to manipulate US treasury auctions, as well as the pricing of US treasury securities 
in the when-issued market, with impacts upon related futures and options, and that certain of the defendants 
participated in a group boycott to prevent the emergence of anonymous all-to-all trading in the secondary market for 
treasury securities. In March 2022, the SDNY granted defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed with prejudice all 
claims against the defendants, and in February 2024, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal.
SSA bonds litigation – Credit Suisse Group AG and certain of its affiliates, together with other financial institutions, were 
named in two Canadian putative class actions, which allege that defendants conspired to fix the prices of SSA bonds sold 
to and purchased from investors in the secondary market. One putative class action was dismissed against Credit Suisse 
in February 2020. In October 2022, in the second action, Credit Suisse entered into an agreement to settle all claims. The 
settlement remains subject to court approval.
Credit default swap auction litigation – In June 2021, Credit Suisse Group AG and affiliates, along with other banks and 
entities, were named in a putative class action complaint filed in the US District Court for the District of New Mexico 
alleging manipulation of credit default swap (CDS) final auction prices. In April 2022, defendants filed a motion to dismiss. 
In June 2023, the court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to dismiss. In November 2023, defendants 
filed a motion to enforce the previous CDS settlement with the SDNY. In January 2024, the SDNY ruled that, to the 
extent claims in the New Mexico action arise from conduct prior to 30 June 2014, those claims are barred by the SDNY 
settlement. In February 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the SDNY decision.
4. OTC trading cases
Interest rate swaps litigation: Credit Suisse Group AG and affiliates, along with other financial institutions, have been 
named in a consolidated putative civil class action complaint and complaints filed by individual plaintiffs relating to interest 
rate swaps, alleging that dealer defendants conspired with trading platforms to prevent the development of interest rate 
swap exchanges. The individual lawsuits were brought by TeraExchange LLC, a swap execution facility, and affiliates; 
Javelin Capital Markets LLC, a swap execution facility, and an affiliate; and trueEX LLC, a swap execution facility, which 
claim to have suffered lost profits as a result of defendants’ alleged conspiracy. All interest rate swap actions have been 
consolidated in a multi-district litigation in the SDNY.
Defendants moved to dismiss the putative class and individual actions, and the SDNY granted in part and denied in part 
these motions.
In February 2019, class plaintiffs in the consolidated multi-district litigation filed a motion for class certification. In March 
2019, class plaintiffs filed a fourth amended consolidated class action complaint. In January 2022, Credit Suisse entered 
into an agreement to settle all class action claims. The settlement remains subject to court approval. In December 2023, 
the SDNY denied the motion for class certification. In January 2024, class plaintiffs filed a petition for leave to appeal the 
denial of class certification.

Credit default swaps litigation: In June 2017, Credit Suisse Group AG and affiliates, along with other financial institutions, 
were named in a civil action filed in the SDNY by Tera Group, Inc. and related entities (Tera), alleging violations of antitrust 
law in connection with the allegation that CDS dealers conspired to block Tera’s electronic CDS trading platform from 
successfully entering the market. In July 2019, the SDNY granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to dismiss. 
In January 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. In April 2020, defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In August 
2023, the court granted the motion, dismissing all claims with prejudice. Plaintiffs have appealed.
Stock loan litigation: Credit Suisse Group AG and certain of its affiliates, as well as other financial institutions, were 
originally named in a number of civil lawsuits in the SDNY, certain of which are brought by class action plaintiffs alleging 
that the defendants conspired to keep stock-loan trading in an over-the-counter market and collectively boycotted certain 
trading platforms that sought to enter the market, and certain of which are brought by trading platforms that sought to 
enter the market alleging that the defendants collectively boycotted the platforms. In January 2022, Credit Suisse entered 
into an agreement to settle all class action claims. In February 2022, the court entered an order granting preliminary 
approval to the agreement to settle all class action claims. The settlement remains subject to final court approval. 
In October 2021, in a consolidated civil litigation brought in the SDNY by entities that developed a trading platform for 
stock loans that sought to enter the market, alleging that the defendants collectively boycotted the platform, the court 
granted defendants’ motion to dismiss. In October 2021, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. In March 2023, the Second 
Circuit affirmed the decision granting defendants’ motion to dismiss.
Odd-lot corporate bond litigation: In April 2020, CSS LLC and other financial institutions were named in a putative class 
action complaint filed in the SDNY, alleging a conspiracy among the financial institutions to boycott electronic trading 
platforms and fix prices in the secondary market for odd-lot corporate bonds. In October 2021, the SDNY granted 
defendants’ motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs have appealed.
5. ATA litigation
Since November 2014, a series of lawsuits have been filed against a number of banks, including Credit Suisse AG and, 
in two instances, Credit Suisse AG, New York Branch, in the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) 
and the SDNY alleging claims under the United States Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) and the Justice Against Sponsors of 
Terrorism Act. The plaintiffs in each of these lawsuits are, or are relatives of, victims of various terrorist attacks in Iraq and 
allege a conspiracy and/or aiding and abetting based on allegations that various international financial institutions, 
including the defendants, agreed to alter, falsify or omit information from payment messages that involved Iranian parties 
for the express purpose of concealing the Iranian parties’ financial activities and transactions from detection by US 
authorities. The lawsuits allege that this conduct has made it possible for Iran to transfer funds to Hezbollah and other 
terrorist organizations actively engaged in harming US military personnel and civilians. In January 2023, the United States 
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed a September 2019 ruling by the EDNY granting defendants’ motion to 
dismiss the first filed lawsuit. In October 2023, the United States Supreme Court denied plaintiffs’ petition for a writ of 
certiorari. In February 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the judgment in the first filed lawsuit. Of the other seven 
cases, four are stayed, including one that was dismissed as to Credit Suisse and most of the bank defendants prior to 
entry of the stay, and in three plaintiffs have filed amended complaints, including two that were dismissed prior to the 
court allowing plaintiffs to replead.
6. Customer account matters
Several clients have claimed that a former relationship manager in Switzerland had exceeded his investment authority in 
the management of their portfolios, resulting in excessive concentrations of certain exposures and investment losses. 
Credit Suisse AG is investigating the claims, as well as transactions among the clients. Credit Suisse AG filed a criminal 
complaint against the former relationship manager with the Geneva Prosecutor’s Office upon which the prosecutor 
initiated a criminal investigation. Several clients of the former relationship manager also filed criminal complaints with 
the Geneva Prosecutor’s Office. In February 2018, the former relationship manager was sentenced to five years in prison 
by the Geneva criminal court for fraud, forgery and criminal mismanagement and ordered to pay damages of 
approximately USD 130m. Several parties appealed the judgment. In June 2019, the Criminal Court of Appeals of Geneva 
ruled in the appeal of the judgment against the former relationship manager, upholding the main findings of the Geneva 
criminal court. Several parties appealed the decision to the Swiss Federal Supreme Court. In February 2020, the Swiss 
Federal Supreme Court rendered its judgment on the appeals, substantially confirming the findings of the Criminal Court 
of Appeals of Geneva.
Civil lawsuits have been initiated against Credit Suisse AG and/or certain affiliates in various jurisdictions, based on the 
findings established in the criminal proceedings against the former relationship manager.

In Singapore, in the civil lawsuit brought against Credit Suisse Trust Limited, a Credit Suisse AG affiliate, in May 2023, 
the Singapore International Commercial Court issued a first instance judgment finding for the plaintiffs and directing the 
parties’ experts to agree on the amount of the damages award according to the calculation method and parameters 
adopted by the court. As the parties’ experts were unable to agree on the amount of the damages, following court 
directions, the parties filed their proposed draft orders with supporting documents in August 2023. In September 2023, 
the court ruled that the damages under its May 2023 judgment are USD 742.73m, excluding post-judgment interest. 
This figure does not exclude potential overlap with the Bermuda proceedings against Credit Suisse Life (Bermuda) Ltd., 
which are currently being appealed. The court ordered the parties to ensure that there shall be no double recovery in 
relation to this award and any sum recovered in the Bermuda proceedings. Credit Suisse Trust Limited has appealed the 
judgment and has applied for a stay of execution pending that appeal. In November 2023, the court granted a stay of 
execution of its May 2023 judgment pending appeal on the condition that damages awarded and post-judgment interest 
accrued are paid into court deposit within 21 days, which condition was satisfied.
In Bermuda, in the civil lawsuit brought against Credit Suisse Life (Bermuda) Ltd., a Credit Suisse AG affiliate, trial took 
place in the Supreme Court of Bermuda in November and December 2021. The Supreme Court of Bermuda issued a first 
instance judgment in March 2022, finding for the plaintiff. In May 2022, the Supreme Court of Bermuda issued an order 
awarding damages of USD 607.35m to the plaintiff. In May 2022, Credit Suisse Life (Bermuda) Ltd. appealed the decision 
to the Bermuda Court of Appeal. In July 2022, the Supreme Court of Bermuda granted a stay of execution of its judgment 
pending appeal on the condition that damages awarded were paid into an escrow account within 42 days, which 
condition was satisfied. In June 2023, the Bermuda Court of Appeal issued its judgment confirming the award issued by 
the Supreme Court of Bermuda and upholding the Supreme Court of Bermuda’s finding that Credit Suisse Life (Bermuda) 
Ltd. had breached its contractual and fiduciary duties, but overturning the Supreme Court of Bermuda’s finding that 
Credit Suisse Life (Bermuda) Ltd. had made fraudulent misrepresentations. In July 2023, Credit Suisse Life (Bermuda) Ltd. 
filed its notice of motion for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and applied for a stay of 
execution of the Bermuda Court of Appeal’s judgment pending the outcome of the appeal to the Judicial Committee of 
the Privy Council on the condition that the damages awarded remain within the escrow account and that interest be 
added to the escrow account calculated at the Bermuda statutory rate of 3.5%. A hearing on the applications for leave 
to appeal and stay of execution took place in December 2023. Further, in December 2023, USD 75m was released from 
the escrow account and paid to plaintiffs. In February 2024, the Bermuda Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal and 
ordered that the current stay shall continue pending determination of the appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy 
Council until and unless the plaintiffs provide a top tier bank guarantee for the remaining judgment debt of USD 536.64m 
plus interest.
In Switzerland, civil lawsuits have commenced against Credit Suisse AG in the Court of First Instance of Geneva, with 
statements of claim served in March 2023.
7. Mozambique matter
Credit Suisse has been subject to investigations by regulatory and enforcement authorities, as well as civil litigation, 
regarding certain Credit Suisse entities’ arrangement of loan financing to Mozambique state enterprises, Proindicus S.A. 
and Empresa Moçambicana de Atum S.A. (EMATUM), a distribution to private investors of loan participation notes (LPN) 
related to the EMATUM financing in September 2013, and certain Credit Suisse entities’ subsequent role in arranging 
the exchange of those LPNs for Eurobonds issued by the Republic of Mozambique. In 2019, three former Credit Suisse 
employees pleaded guilty in the EDNY to accepting improper personal benefits in connection with financing transactions 
carried out with two Mozambique state enterprises.
In October 2021, Credit Suisse reached settlements with the DOJ, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the 
UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and FINMA to resolve inquiries by these agencies, including findings that Credit 
Suisse failed to appropriately organize and conduct its business with due skill and care, and manage risks. Credit Suisse 
Group AG entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the DOJ in connection with the criminal 
information charging Credit Suisse Group AG with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and consented to the entry of a 
Cease and Desist Order by the SEC. Under the terms of the DPA, UBS Group AG (as successor to Credit Suisse Group 
AG) must continue compliance enhancement and remediation efforts agreed by Credit Suisse, report to the DOJ on those 
efforts for three years and undertake additional measures as outlined in the DPA. If the DPA’s conditions are complied 
with, the charges will be dismissed at the end of the DPA’s three-year term. In addition, CSSEL entered into a Plea 
Agreement and pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the US federal wire fraud statute. CSSEL is bound by 
the same compliance, remediation and reporting obligations under the DPA. The total monetary sanctions paid to the 
DOJ and SEC, taking into account various credits and offsets, was approximately USD 275m. Under the terms of the 
resolution with the DOJ, Credit Suisse also paid USD 22.6m in restitution to eligible investors in the 2016 Eurobonds 
issued by the Republic of Mozambique.
In connection with the resolution with the FCA, Credit Suisse paid a penalty of approximately USD 200m and, further to 
an agreement with the FCA, forgave USD 200m of debt owed to Credit Suisse by Mozambique.

The FINMA decree concluding its enforcement proceeding, ordered the bank to remediate certain deficiencies. Credit 
Suisse’s implementation of the measures required under the FINMA decree has been reviewed by an independent third 
party appointed by FINMA, which review recommends some enhancements to the measures that Credit Suisse has 
implemented. FINMA also arranged for certain existing transactions to be reviewed by the same independent third party 
on the basis of specific risk criteria, and required enhanced disclosure of certain sovereign transactions.
In February 2019, certain Credit Suisse entities, three former employees and several other unrelated entities were sued 
in the English High Court by the Republic of Mozambique seeking a declaration that the sovereign guarantee issued in 
connection with the ProIndicus loan syndication was void, and damages. Credit Suisse entities subsequently filed cross 
claims against several entities controlled by Privinvest Holding SAL (Privinvest) that acted as the project contractor, 
Iskandar Safa, the owner of Privinvest, and several Mozambique officials. In addition, several of the banks that 
participated in the ProIndicus loan syndicate brought claims against Credit Suisse entities seeking a declaration that Credit 
Suisse is liable to compensate them for alleged losses suffered as a result of any invalidity of the sovereign guarantee or 
damages stemming from the alleged loss. In September 2023, Credit Suisse, the Republic of Mozambique, and certain 
of the lenders in the ProIndicus syndicate entered into a settlement agreement that, with the subsequent settlement with 
Privinvest entities referred to below, resolved all claims involving Credit Suisse entities in the English High Court.
In February 2022, Privinvest and Iskandar Safa brought a defamation claim in a Lebanese court against CSSEL and Credit 
Suisse Group AG and in November 2022, a Privinvest employee who was the lead negotiator on behalf of the Privinvest 
entities in relation to the Mozambique transactions, also brought a defamation claim in the same court against those 
entities. In November 2023, UBS Group AG (as successor to Credit Suisse Group AG), the Credit Suisse entities, Privinvest 
and Iskandar Safa entered into an agreement to settle all claims among them in the English High Court and in Lebanon.
8. Cross-border private banking matters
Credit Suisse offices in various locations, including the UK, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, have been contacted 
by regulatory and law enforcement authorities that are seeking records and information concerning investigations into 
Credit Suisse’s historical private banking services on a cross-border basis and in part through its local branches and banks. 
Credit Suisse has conducted a review of these issues, the UK and French aspects of which have been closed, and is 
continuing to cooperate with the authorities.
9. ETN-related litigation
XIV litigation: Since March 2018, three class action complaints were filed in the SDNY on behalf of a putative class of 
purchasers of VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term Exchange Traded Notes linked to the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term 
Futures Index due December 4, 2030 (XIV ETNs). In August 2018, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action 
complaint, naming Credit Suisse Group AG and certain affiliates and executives, which asserts claims for violations of 
Sections 9(a)(4), 9(f), 10(b) and 20(a) of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and Sections 
11 and 15 of the US Securities Act of 1933 and alleges that the defendants are responsible for losses to investors following 
a decline in the value of XIV ETNs in February 2018. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint in November 
2018. In September 2019, the SDNY granted defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed with prejudice all claims 
against the defendants. In October 2019, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. In April 2021, the Second Circuit issued an 
order affirming in part and vacating in part the SDNY’s September 2019 decision granting defendants’ motion to dismiss 
with prejudice. In July 2022, plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. In March 2023, the court denied plaintiffs’ 
motion to certify two of their three alleged classes and granted plaintiffs’ motion to certify their third alleged class. In 
March 2023, defendants moved for reconsideration and filed a petition for permission to appeal the court’s class 
certification decision to the Second Circuit. In April 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking leave to amend their complaint. 
In May 2023, plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification, which defendants have opposed. In January 2024, 
the court issued an order denying plaintiffs’ motion to amend. In March 2024, the court denied plaintiffs’ renewed 
motion to certify two of the three alleged classes, without prejudice, and denied defendants’ motion for reconsideration 
on the certification of the third alleged class.
DGAZ litigation: In January 2022, Credit Suisse AG was named in a class action complaint filed in the SDNY brought on 
behalf of a putative class of short sellers of VelocityShares 3x Inverse Natural Gas Exchange Traded Notes linked to the 
S&P GSCI Natural Gas Index ER due February 9, 2032 (DGAZ ETNs). The complaint asserts claims for violations of Section 
10(b) of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder and alleges that Credit Suisse is responsible 
for losses suffered by short sellers following a June 2020 announcement that Credit Suisse would delist and suspend 
further issuances of the DGAZ ETNs. In July 2022, Credit Suisse AG filed a motion to dismiss. In March 2023, the court 
granted Credit Suisse AG’s motion to dismiss. In May 2023, the court entered an order dismissing the case with prejudice. 
In February 2024, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal.

10. Bulgarian former clients matter
Credit Suisse AG has been responding to an investigation by the Swiss Office of the Attorney General (SOAG) concerning 
the diligence and controls applied to a historical relationship with Bulgarian former clients who are alleged to have 
laundered funds through Credit Suisse AG accounts. In December 2020, the SOAG brought charges against Credit Suisse 
AG and other parties. Credit Suisse AG believes its diligence and controls complied with applicable legal requirements 
and intends to defend itself vigorously. The trial in the Swiss Federal Criminal Court took place in the first quarter of 
2022. In June 2022, Credit Suisse AG was convicted in the Swiss Federal Criminal Court of certain historical organizational 
inadequacies in its anti-money laundering framework and ordered to pay a fine of CHF 2m. In addition, the court seized 
certain client assets in the amount of approximately CHF 12m and ordered Credit Suisse AG to pay a compensatory claim 
in the amount of approximately CHF 19m. In July 2022, Credit Suisse AG appealed the decision to the Swiss Federal 
Court of Appeals.
11. SCFF
Credit Suisse has received requests for documents and information in connection with inquiries, investigations, 
enforcement and other actions relating to the supply chain finance funds (SCFF) matter by FINMA, the FCA and other 
regulatory and governmental agencies. The Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier is reviewing 
the matter and has commissioned a report from a third party. Credit Suisse is cooperating with these authorities.
In February 2023, FINMA announced the conclusion of its enforcement proceedings against Credit Suisse in connection 
with the SCFF matter. In its order, FINMA reported that Credit Suisse had seriously breached applicable Swiss supervisory 
laws in this context with regard to risk management and appropriate operational structures. While FINMA recognized 
that Credit Suisse has already taken extensive organizational measures based on its own investigation into the SCFF 
matter, particularly to strengthen its governance and control processes, and FINMA is supportive of these measures, the 
regulator has ordered certain additional remedial measures. These include a requirement that the most important 
(approximately 500) business relationships must be reviewed periodically and holistically at the Credit Suisse Executive 
Board level, in particular for counterparty risks, and that Credit Suisse must set up a document defining the responsibilities 
of approximately 600 of its highest-ranking managers. The latter of these measures has been made applicable UBS Group. 
Separate from the enforcement proceeding regarding Credit Suisse, FINMA has opened four enforcement proceedings 
against former managers of Credit Suisse.
In May 2023, FINMA opened an enforcement proceeding against Credit Suisse in order to confirm compliance with 
supervisory requirements in response to inquiries from FINMA’s enforcement division in the SCFF matter.
The Attorney General of the Canton of Zurich has initiated a criminal procedure in connection with the SCFF matter and 
several fund investors have joined the procedure as interested parties. In such procedure, while certain former and active 
Credit Suisse employees, among others, have been named as accused persons, Credit Suisse itself is not a party to the 
procedure.
Certain civil actions have been filed by fund investors and other parties against Credit Suisse and/or certain officers and 
directors in various jurisdictions, which make allegations including mis-selling and breaches of duties of care, diligence 
and other fiduciary duties. 
12. Archegos
Credit Suisse has received requests for documents and information in connection with inquiries, investigations and/or 
actions relating to Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos Capital Management (Archegos), including from FINMA 
(assisted by a third party appointed by FINMA), the DOJ, the SEC, the US Federal Reserve, the US Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (CFTC), the US Senate Banking Committee, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the FCA, 
COMCO, the Hong Kong Competition Commission and other regulatory and governmental agencies. Credit Suisse is 
cooperating with the authorities in these matters.
In July 2023, the US Federal Reserve and the PRA announced resolutions of their investigations of Credit Suisse’s 
relationship with Archegos. UBS Group AG, Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse Holdings (USA) Inc., and Credit Suisse AG, 
New York Branch entered into an Order to Cease and Desist with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. 
Under the terms of the order, Credit Suisse paid a civil money penalty of USD 269m and agreed to undertake certain 
remedial measures relating to counterparty credit risk management, liquidity risk management and non-financial risk 
management, as well as enhancements to board oversight and governance.
CSI and CSSEL entered into a settlement agreement with the PRA providing for the resolution of the PRA’s investigation, 
following which the PRA published a Final Notice imposing a financial penalty of GBP 87m on CSI and CSSEL for breaches 
of various of the PRA’s Fundamental Rules.

Note 18 Provisions and contingent liabilities (continued)
FINMA also entered a decree dated 14 July 2023 announcing the conclusion of its enforcement proceeding, finding that 
Credit Suisse had seriously violated financial market law in connection with its business relationship with Archegos and 
ordering remedial measures directed at Credit Suisse AG and UBS Group AG, as the legal successor to Credit Suisse 
Group AG. These include a requirement that UBS Group AG apply its restrictions on its own positions relating to individual 
clients throughout the financial group, as well as adjustments to the compensation system of the entire financial group 
to provide for bonus allocation criteria that take into account risk appetite. FINMA also announced it has opened 
enforcement proceedings against a former Credit Suisse manager in connection with this matter.
Civil actions relating to Credit Suisse’s relationship with Archegos have been filed against Credit Suisse and/or certain 
officers and directors, including claims for breaches of fiduciary duties.
13. Credit Suisse financial disclosures
Credit Suisse Group AG and certain directors, officers and executives have been named in securities class action 
complaints pending in the SDNY. These complaints, filed on behalf of purchasers of Credit Suisse shares, additional tier 
1 capital notes (“AT1 notes”), and other securities in 2023, allege that defendants made misleading statements 
regarding: (i) customer outflows in late 2022; (ii) the adequacy of Credit Suisse’s financial reporting controls; and (iii) the 
adequacy of Credit Suisse’s risk management processes, and include allegations relating to Credit Suisse Group AG’s 
merger with UBS Group AG. Many of the actions have been consolidated, and a motion to dismiss has been filed and 
remains pending. One additional action, filed in October 2023, has been stayed pending a determination on whether it 
should be consolidated with the earlier actions.
Credit Suisse has received requests for documents and information from regulatory and governmental agencies in 
connection with inquiries, investigations and/or actions relating to these matters, as well as for other statements regarding 
Credit Suisse’s financial condition, including from the SEC, the DOJ and FINMA. Credit Suisse is cooperating with the 
authorities in these matters.
14. Merger-related litigation
Certain Credit Suisse Group AG affiliates and certain directors, officers and executives have been named in class action 
complaints pending in the SDNY. One complaint, brought on behalf of Credit Suisse shareholders, alleges breaches of 
fiduciary duty under Swiss law and civil RICO claims under United States federal law. In February 2024, the court granted 
defendants’ motions to dismiss the civil RICO claims and conditionally dismissed the Swiss law claims pending defendants’ 
acceptance of jurisdiction in Switzerland. In March 2024, having received consents to Swiss jurisdiction from all 
defendants served with the complaint, the court dismissed the Swiss law claims against those defendants. Additional 
complaints, brought on behalf of holders of Credit Suisse additional tier 1 capital notes (“AT1 noteholders”) allege 
breaches of fiduciary duty under Swiss law, arising from a series of scandals and misconduct, which led to Credit Suisse 
Group AG’s merger with UBS Group AG, causing losses to shareholders and AT1 noteholders. The motion to dismiss the 
first of these complaints was granted in March 2024 on the basis that Switzerland and not New York is the most 
appropriate forum for litigation.

Additional information
Note 20 Expected credit loss measurement
a) Expected credit losses in the period
Total net credit loss expenses were USD 1,037m in 2023, reflecting net credit loss expenses of USD 593m related to stage 1 
and 2 positions and net credit loss expenses of USD 445m related to credit-impaired (stage 3 and purchased credit-impaired) 
positions. Expected credit loss (ECL) expenses of USD 593m for performing loans were predominantly attributable to the 
initial recognition of ECL allowances and provisions after the date of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Creditimpaired net expenses amounted to USD 445m, of which USD 325m was within the Credit Suisse portfolio and USD 120m 
was within the UBS portfolio. As per IFRS 9, no ECL allowances and provisions had to be recognized at acquisition date for 
credit-impaired exposures, after the fair valuation as per the purchase price allocation.

b) Changes to ECL models, scenarios, scenario weights and key inputs 
Refer to Note 1a for information about the principles governing ECL models, scenarios, scenario weights and key inputs 
applied. 
Governance
Comprehensive cross-functional and cross-divisional governance processes are in place and are used to discuss and approve 
scenario updates and weights, to assess whether significant increases in credit risk resulted in stage transfers, to review 
model outputs and to reach conclusions regarding post-model adjustments. 
Model changes
During 2023, the model review and enhancement process led to adjustments of the probability of default (PD), loss given 
default (LGD) and credit conversion factor (CCF) models, resulting in a USD 22m increase in ECL allowances. This included 
an increase of USD 13m in Global Wealth Management related to Large corporate clients and an USD 14m increase in 
Personal & Corporate Banking related to lending to Large corporate clients and SME clients. 
Scenario and key input updates
During 2023, the scenarios and related macroeconomic factors were updated from those applied at the end of 2022 by 
considering the prevailing economic and political conditions and uncertainty. The review focused on events that 
significantly changed the economic outlook during the year: the inflation outlook and economic growth in Europe, and 
rising global interest rates due to central banks adopting more restrictive monetary policies. ECLs for Credit Suisse AG 
positions were calculated based on Credit Suisse AG’s models, including the same scenario and scenario weight inputs 
as for UBS’s existing business activity.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 347
Note 20 Expected credit loss measurement (continued)
Baseline scenario: the projections of the baseline scenario, which are aligned to the economic and market assumptions used 
for UBS’s business planning purposes, are broadly in line with external benchmarks, such as those from Bloomberg 
Consensus, Oxford Economics and the International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook. The expectation for 2024 is 
that global growth slows down under the weight of monetary policy tightening and continued pressure on real purchasing 
power due to high, though falling, inflation, and fading fiscal support. Unemployment rates are forecast to increase slightly 
from their 2023 levels. Interest rates are expected to remain high, given the persistence of inflationary pressures, leading to 
a less optimistic outlook for house prices worldwide, including Switzerland.
Mild debt crisis scenario: The first hypothetical downside scenario is the mild debt crisis scenario. At the beginning of the 
second quarter of 2023, UBS replaced the global crisis scenario applied at the end of 2022 and at the end of the first quarter 
of 2023 with the mild debt crisis scenario. Economic, market and political developments suggested that the scenario suite 
should be rebalanced by reintroducing a mild downside scenario. The mild debt crisis scenario covers similar risks, but the 
assumptions are milder than the global crisis scenario. Therefore, the scenario shocks are less severe. It assumes that political, 
solvency and liquidity concerns cause a sell-off of sovereign debt in emerging markets and the peripheral Eurozone. The 
global economy and financial markets are negatively affected, and central banks are assumed to ease their monetary policy.
Stagflationary geopolitical crisis scenario: The second downside scenario is aligned with the 2024 Group binding stress 
scenario and was updated in 2023 to reflect expected risks, resulting in minimal changes. Geopolitical tensions cause an 
escalation of security concerns and undermine globalization. The ensuing economic regionalization leads to a surge in global 
commodity prices and further disruptions of supply chains and raises the specter of prolonged stagflation. Central banks 
are forced to further tighten monetary policy to contain inflationary pressures. The severe interest rate and house price 
assumptions in the scenario had a substantive impact on model-based ECL allowances for loans secured by mortgages in 
Switzerland and the US. These effects were partly offset by post-model adjustment releases related to loans secured by 
mortgages. Refer to the section below on “Scenario weights and post-model adjustments” for more details.
Asset price inflation scenario: The upside scenario is based on positive developments, such as an easing of geopolitical 
tensions across the globe and a rebound in Chinese economic growth. A combination of lower commodity prices, effective 
monetary policies and easing supply chain disruptions helps to reduce inflation. Improved consumer and business sentiment 
lead to a global economic rebound, enabling central banks to normalize interest rates, which causes asset prices to increase 
significantly.
The table below details the key assumptions for the four scenarios applied as of 31 December 2023.
Scenario weights and post-model adjustments
The scenario weights did not change during 2023, but the scenario suite was adjusted in the second quarter of 2023 to 
replace one of the two severe downside scenarios with a mild downside scenario. The mild debt crisis, developed in early 
2023, was introduced in the scenario suite with the same weight as the more severe global crisis scenario, i.e., 15%, to 
balance a somewhat more optimistic outlook with milder scenario assumptions. The weights were kept unchanged for 
the stagflationary geopolitical crisis, baseline and asset price inflation scenarios, i.e., 25%, 60% and 0%, respectively. 
The weights are shown in the table below. 
However, unquantifiable risks continue to be relevant, as the geopolitical risks remained high in 2023, and the impact 
on the world economy from escalations with unforeseeable consequences could be severe. In the near term, this 
uncertainty relates primarily to developments in the Russia–Ukraine and Middle East conflicts. Models, which are based 
on supportable statistical information from past experiences regarding interdependencies of macroeconomic factors and 
their implications for credit risk portfolios, cannot comprehensively reflect such extraordinary events, such as a pandemic 
or a fundamental change in the world political order. Rather than creating multiple additional scenarios to attempt to 
gauge these risks and applying model parameters that lack supportable information and cannot be robustly validated, 
management continued to also apply post-model adjustments. 
Total stage 1 and 2 allowances and provisions were USD 1,115m as of 31 December 2023 and included post-model 
adjustments of USD 326m (31 December 2022: USD 131m). Overlays are to cover for uncertainty levels and are materially 
unchanged, including the geopolitical situation, for Credit Suisse models that may not comprehensively reflect market 
events and to align model outputs for Credit Suisse with those of UBS for dedicated segments.

c) Development of ECL allowances and provisions 
The ECL allowances and provisions recognized in the period are impacted by a variety of factors, such as:
– the effect of selecting and updating forward-looking scenarios and the respective weights;
– origination of new instruments during the period; 
– the effect of passage of time (lower residual lifetime PD and the effect of discount unwind) as the ECL on an instrument 
for the remaining lifetime decreases (all other factors remaining the same);
– derecognition of instruments in the period;
– change in individual asset quality of instruments;
– movements from a maximum 12-month ECL to the recognition of lifetime ECL (and vice versa) following transfers 
between stages 1 and 2; 
– movements from stages 1 and 2 to stage 3 (credit-impaired status) when default has become certain and PD increases 
to 100% (or vice versa);
– changes in models or updates to model parameters;
– write-off; and
– foreign exchange translations for assets denominated in foreign currencies.
The table below explains the changes in the ECL allowances and provisions for on- and off-balance sheet financial 
instruments and credit lines within the scope of ECL requirements between the beginning and the end of the period due 
to the factors listed above.

Note 20 Expected credit loss measurement (continued)
Movements with profit or loss impact: Stages 1 and 2 ECL allowances and provisions increased on a net basis by 
USD 1,037m:
– Acquisition of Credit Suisse AG portfolios: Expected credit loss (ECL) expenses of USD 541m for performing loans were 
attributable to the initial recognition of ECL stage 1 allowances and provisions as of the date of the acquisition of the 
Credit Suisse Group.
– Net movement from new and derecognized transactions includes stage 1 expenses of USD 2m and stage 2 releases 
of USD 9m: Stage 1 expenses are mainly driven by expenses on the corporate lending portfolios, partly offset by 
releases on the real estate portfolios. Stage 2 releases are predominately driven by the real estate and corporate 
lending portfolios.
– Remeasurements with stage transfers include USD 149m expenses in stage 2, following a number of corporate and 
real estate lending credit reviews and transfer to stage 2 for the Credit Suisse AG portfolio after the date of the 
acquisition. 
– Model changes: refer to Note 20b for more information.
Movements without profit or loss impact: Stages 1 and 2 allowances decreased by USD 4m, almost entirely driven by FX. 
Stage 3 and PCI allowances increased by USD 136m, driven by FX and other movements of USD 229m, partly offset by 
net write-offs of USD 93m.

Note 20 Expected credit loss measurement (continued)
As explained in Note 1a, the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk (an SICR) considers a number of qualitative 
and quantitative factors to determine whether a stage transfer between stage 1 and stage 2 is required, although the 
primary assessment considers changes in PD based on rating analyses and economic outlook. Additionally, UBS takes into 
consideration counterparties that have moved to a credit watch list and those with payments that are at least 30 days 
past due.

As per IFRS, the Credit Suisse acquisition date in June 2023 represented the benchmark for determining “significant 
deterioration of credit risk” for Credit Suisse exposures, and accordingly, UBS did only recognize stage 1 ECL allowances 
and provisions for performing loans at acquisition date. As of 31 December 2023, stage 2 allowances and provisions for 
Credit Suisse exposures were largely driven by prolonged and re-confirmed affiliation to the credit watchlist. 
d) Maximum exposure to credit risk
The tables below provide the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for financial instruments subject to ECL 
requirements and the respective collateral and other credit enhancements mitigating credit risk for these classes of 
financial instruments. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk includes the carrying amounts of financial instruments recognized on the balance 
sheet subject to credit risk and the notional amounts for off-balance sheet arrangements. Where information is available, 
collateral is presented at fair value. For other collateral, such as real estate, a reasonable alternative value is used. Credit 
enhancements, such as credit derivative contracts and guarantees, are included at their notional amounts. Both are 
capped at the maximum exposure to credit risk for which they serve as security. The “Risk management and control” 
section of this report describes management’s view of credit risk and the related exposures, which can differ in certain 
respects from the requirements of IFRS Accounting Standards.

2022: USD 113m) to total off-balance sheet financial instruments and credit lines for credit-impaired positions. 2 Collateral arrangements generally incorporate a range of collateral, including cash, equity and debt 
instruments, real estate and other collateral. For the purpose of this disclosure, UBS applies a risk-based approach that generally prioritizes collateral according to its liquidity profile. In the case of loan facilities with 
funded and unfunded elements, the collateral is first allocated to the funded element. Credit Suisse applies a risk-based approach that generally prioritizes real estate collateral and prioritizes other collateral according 
to its liquidity profile. In the case of loan facilities with funded and unfunded elements, the collateral is proportionally allocated. 3 Includes but is not limited to life insurance contracts, rights in respect of subscription 
or capital commitments from fund partners, leasing items, mortgage loans, inventory, gold and other commodities. 4 Amounts due from banks include amounts held with third-party banks on behalf of clients. The 
credit risk associated with these balances may be borne by those clients. 5 Included within Cash collateral receivables on derivative instruments are margin balances due from exchanges or clearing houses. Some of 
these margin balances reflect amounts transferred on behalf of clients who retain the associated credit risk. 6 The amount shown in the “Netting” column represents the netting potential not recognized on the 
balance sheet. Refer to Note 22 for more information. 7 Refer to Note 2 for more information about the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. 8 Guarantees collateralized by equity and debt instruments include 
certain overnight repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions where UBS acts as a sponsoring member for eligible clients when clearing through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC). As part of this 
arrangement, UBS guarantees FICC for prompt and full payment and performance of the clients‘ respective obligations under the FICC rules. The Group minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a 
security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the risk of loss is expected to be remote.

e) Financial assets subject to credit risk by rating category
The table below shows the credit quality and the maximum exposure to credit risk based on the Group’s internal credit 
rating system and year-end stage classification. Under IFRS 9, the credit risk rating reflects the Group’s assessment of the 
probability of default of individual counterparties, prior to substitutions. The amounts presented are gross of impairment 
allowances.

Note 20 Expected credit loss measurement (continued)
f) Sensitivity information
As outlined in Note 1a, ECL estimates involve significant uncertainties at the time they are made.
ECL models
The models applied to determine point-in-time PD and LGD rely on market and statistical data, which has been found 
to correlate well with historically observed defaults in sufficiently homogeneous segments. The risk sensitivities for 
each of the ECL reporting segments to such factors are summarized in Note 10.
Sustainability and climate risk
Sustainability and climate risk may negatively affect clients or portfolios due to direct or indirect transition costs, or 
exposure to physical risks in locations likely to be impacted by climate change. Such effects could lead to a deterioration 
in credit worthiness, which in turn would have an impact on ECLs. 
While some macroeconomic indicators used in the current PD models could be influenced by climate change, UBS 
currently does not use a specific sustainability and climate risk scenario in addition to the typically four general economic 
scenarios applied to derive the weighted-average ECL. The rationale for the approach at this point in time is the 
significance of model risks and challenges in calibration and probability weight assessment given the paucity of data. 
Instead, UBS focuses on the process of vetting clients and business transactions and takes individual actions, where 
transition risk is deemed to be a significant driver of a counterparty’s credit worthiness. This review process may lead to 
a downward revision of the counterparty’s credit rating, or the adoption of risk mitigating actions, and hence affect the 
individual contribution to ECLs.
At the portfolio level, UBS has started to use stress loss assumptions to assess the extent to which sustainability and 
climate risk may affect the quality of the loans extended to small and medium-sized entities, large corporate clients and 
financial institutions. Initial tests were based on a set of assumptions presented by external parties (such as the Bank of 
England) and complemented by internally derived climate pathway scenarios. Such analysis undertaken during 2022 and 
reassessed during 2023 concluded that the counterparties are not expected to be significantly impacted by physical or 
transition risks, mainly as there are no material risk concentrations in high-risk sectors. The analysis of the corporate loan 
book has also shown that any potential significant impacts from transition costs or physical risks would materialize over 
a time horizon that exceeds in most cases the contractual lifetime of the underlying assets. Based on current information 
on regulatory developments, this would also apply to the portfolio of private clients’ mortgages and real estate financing, 
given the long lead times for investments in upgrading housing stock.
As a result of the aforementioned factors, it was assessed that the magnitude of any impact of sustainability and climate 
risk on the weighted-average ECL would not be material as of 31 December 2023. Therefore, no specific post-model 
adjustment was made in this regard.
› Refer to “Sustainability and climate risk” in the “Risk management and control” section of this report 
› Refer to “Our focus on sustainability and climate” in the “Our strategy, business model and environment” section of this report
› Refer to “UBS AG consolidated supplemental disclosures required under SEC regulations” for the maturity profile of UBS’s core 
loan book 
Forward-looking scenarios
Depending on the scenario selection and related macroeconomic assumptions for the risk factors, the components of 
the relevant weighted-average ECL change. This is particularly relevant for interest rates, which can move in both 
directions under a given growth assumption, e.g., low growth with high interest rates in a stagflation scenario, versus 
low growth and falling interest rates in a recession. Management generally looks for scenario narratives that reflect the 
key risk drivers of a given credit portfolio.
As forecasting models are complex, due to the combination of multiple factors, simple what-if analyses involving a change 
of individual parameters do not necessarily provide realistic information on the exposure of segments to changes in the 
macroeconomy. Portfolio-specific analyses based on their key risk factors would also not be meaningful, as potential 
compensatory effects in other segments would be ignored. The table below indicates some sensitivities to ECLs, if a key 
macroeconomic variable for the forecasting period is amended across all scenarios with all other factors remaining 
unchanged.

Sensitivities can be more meaningfully assessed in the context of coherent scenarios with consistently developed 
macroeconomic factors. The table above outlines favorable and unfavorable effects, based on reasonably possible 
alternative changes to the economic conditions for stage 1 and stage 2 positions. The ECL impact is calculated for material 
portfolios and disclosed for each scenario. 
Changes to these timelines may have an effect on ECLs: depending on the cycle, a longer or shorter forecasting horizon 
will lead to different annualized lifetime PD and average LGD estimations. This is currently not deemed to be material for 
UBS, as a large proportion of loans, including mortgages in Switzerland, have maturities that are within the forecasting 
horizon.

Scenario weights
ECL is sensitive to changing scenario weights, in particular if narratives and parameters are selected that are not close to 
the baseline scenario, highlighting the non-linearity of credit losses.
As shown in the table above, the ECLs for stage 1 and stage 2 positions would have been USD 832m (31 December 
2022: USD 329m) instead of USD 1,115m (31 December 2022: USD 526m) if ECLs had been determined solely on the 
baseline scenario. The weighted-average ECL therefore amounted to 134% (31 December 2022: 160%) of the baseline 
value. The effects of weighting each of the four scenarios 100% are shown in the table above.
Stage allocation and SICR
The determination of what constitutes an SICR is based on management judgment, as explained in Note 1a. Changing 
the SICR trigger will have a direct effect on ECLs, as more or fewer positions would be subject to lifetime ECLs under any 
scenario. 
The relevance of the SICR trigger on overall ECL is demonstrated in the table above with the indication that the ECL 
allowances and provisions for stage 1 and stage 2 positions would have been USD 2,225m, if all non-impaired positions 
across the portfolio had been measured for lifetime ECLs irrespective of their actual SICR status. This amount compares 
with actual stage 1 and 2 allowances and provisions of USD 1,115m as of 31 December 2023.
Maturity profile
The maturity profile is an important driver in ECLs, in particular for transactions in stage 2. A transfer of a transaction 
into stage 2 may therefore have a significant effect on ECLs. The current maturity profile of most lending books is 
relatively short. 
Lending to large corporate clients is generally between one and two years, with related loan commitments up to four 
years. Real estate lending is generally between two and three years in Switzerland, with long dated maturities in the US. 
Lombard-lending contracts typically have average contractual maturities of 12 months or less, and include callable 
features.
A significant portion of our lending to SME clients and Real estate financing is documented under multi-purpose credit 
agreements, which allow for various forms of utilization but are unconditionally cancelable by UBS at any time: (i) for 
drawings under such agreements with a fixed maturity, the respective term is applied for ECL calculations, or a maximum 
of 12 months in stage 1; (ii) for unused credit lines and all drawings that have no fixed maturity (e.g., current accounts), 
UBS generally applies a 12-month maturity from the reporting date, given the credit review policies, which require either 
continuous monitoring of key indicators and behavioral patterns for smaller positions or an annual formal review for any 
other limit. The ECLs for these products are sensitive to shortening or extending the maturity assumption.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 358
Note 21 Fair value measurement
a) Valuation principles
All financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are categorized into one of three 
fair value hierarchy levels in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. The fair value hierarchy is based on the 
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. In certain cases, the inputs 
used to measure fair value may fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. For disclosure purposes, the level in 
the hierarchy within which an instrument is classified in its entirety is based on the lowest level input that is significant to 
the position’s fair value measurement:
– Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities;
– Level 2 – valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are, or are based on, observable market data; or
– Level 3 – valuation techniques for which significant inputs are not based on observable market data.
Fair values are determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, where available. Where 
the market for a financial instrument or non-financial asset or liability is not active, fair value is established using a 
valuation technique, including pricing models. Valuation adjustments may be made to allow for additional factors, 
including model, liquidity, credit and funding risks, which are not explicitly captured within the valuation technique, but 
which would nevertheless be considered by market participants when establishing a price. The limitations inherent in a 
particular valuation technique are considered in the determination of the classification of an asset or liability within the 
fair value hierarchy. Generally, the unit of account for a financial instrument is the individual instrument, and UBS applies 
valuation adjustments at an individual instrument level, consistent with that unit of account. However, if certain 
conditions are met, UBS may estimate the fair value of a portfolio of financial assets and liabilities with substantially 
similar and offsetting risk exposures on the basis of the net open risks.
› Refer to Note 21d for more information 
b) Valuation governance
UBS’s fair value measurement and model governance framework includes numerous controls and other procedural 
safeguards that are intended to maximize the quality of fair value measurements reported in the financial statements. 
New products and valuation techniques must be reviewed and approved by key stakeholders from the risk and finance 
control functions. Responsibility for the ongoing measurement of financial and non-financial instruments at fair value is 
with the business divisions. 
Fair value estimates are validated by the risk and finance control functions, which are independent of the business 
divisions. Independent price verification is performed by Finance through benchmarking the business divisions’ fair value 
estimates with observable market prices and other independent sources. A governance framework and associated 
controls are in place in order to monitor the quality of third-party pricing sources where used. For instruments where 
valuation models are used to determine fair value, independent valuation and model control groups within Finance and 
Risk Control evaluate UBS’s models on a regular basis, including valuation and model input parameters, as well as pricing. 
As a result of the valuation controls employed, valuation adjustments may be made to the business divisions’ estimates 
of fair value to align with independent market data and the relevant accounting standard.

Note 21 Fair value measurement (continued)
c) Fair value hierarchy
The table below provides the fair value hierarchy classification of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured 
at fair value. The narrative that follows describes valuation techniques used in measuring their fair value of different 
product types (including significant valuation inputs and assumptions used), and the factors considered in determining 
their classification within the fair value hierarchy.
During 2023, and for Credit Suisse for the period between the acquisition date and 31 December 2023, assets and 
liabilities that were transferred from Level 2 to Level 1, or from Level 1 to Level 2, and were held for the entire reporting 
period were not material. Level 3 assets increased by USD 26.5bn as of 31 December 2023, compared to 31 December 
2022, following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, including the reclassification of financial assets from amortized 
cost to fair value through profit or loss in the second half of 2023 (with retrospective adjustment of the acquisition date 
balance sheet), mainly reflecting USD 19bn of traded loans, including USD 5bn of securitized lending facilities, a USD 6bn 
loan with securitization collateral and USD 3bn of revolving loan facilities, that were deemed unobservable.
Further, in the fourth quarter of 2023, UBS prospectively amended its approach to testing for observability as part of an 
accounting methodology alignment following the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. This methodological change 
enhances UBS’s assessment of sensitivities to unobservable valuation parameters. Application of the new methodology 
as of 31 December 2022 would have resulted in USD 1.3bn lower Level 3 liabilities (as of 31 December 2023 the balance 
of affected liabilities in Level 3 was USD 1.9bn), with an offsetting impact to Level 2 liabilities.
In addition, the levelling of USD 2.4bn of financial assets at fair value held for trading (loans) from the Credit Suisse subgroup was finalized in compliance with the new aligned methodology. This has been reflected retrospectively to the 
acquisition balance sheet date of 31 May 2023, resulting in a USD 2.4bn increase in Level 3 Financial assets at fair value 
held for trading (loans) and a USD 17m increase in Level 3 Derivative financial liabilities as of 31 May 2023, with an 
offsetting effect in Level 2 assets and liabilities, respectively.

to Note 2 for more information about the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
Valuation techniques 
UBS uses widely recognized valuation techniques for determining the fair value of financial and non-financial instruments 
that are not actively traded and quoted. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include discounted value of 
expected cash flows, relative value and option pricing methodologies.
Discounted value of expected cash flows is a valuation technique that measures fair value using estimated expected 
future cash flows from assets or liabilities and then discounts these cash flows using a discount rate or discount margin 
that reflects the credit and / or funding spreads required by the market for instruments with similar risk and liquidity 
profiles to produce a present value. When using such valuation techniques, expected future cash flows are estimated 
using an observed or implied market price for the future cash flows or by using industry-standard cash flow projection 
models. The discount factors within the calculation are generated using industry-standard yield curve modeling 
techniques and models.
Relative value models measure fair value based on the market prices of equivalent or comparable assets or liabilities, making 
adjustments for differences between the characteristics of the observed instrument and the instrument being valued.
Option pricing models incorporate assumptions regarding the behavior of future price movements of an underlying 
referenced asset or assets to generate a probability-weighted future expected payoff for the option. The resulting 
probability-weighted expected payoff is then discounted using discount factors generated from industry-standard yield 
curve modeling techniques and models. The option pricing model may be implemented using a closed-form analytical 
formula or other mathematical techniques (e.g., binomial tree or Monte Carlo simulation).
Where available, valuation techniques use market-observable assumptions and inputs. If such data is not available, inputs 
may be derived by reference to similar assets in active markets, from recent prices for comparable transactions or from 
other observable market data. In such cases, the inputs selected are based on historical experience and practice for similar 
or analogous instruments, derivation of input levels based on similar products with observable price levels, and knowledge 
of current market conditions and valuation approaches.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 361
Note 21 Fair value measurement (continued)
For more complex instruments, fair values may be estimated using a combination of observed transaction prices, 
consensus pricing services and relevant quotes. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotes (e.g., indicative or firm) 
and the relationship of recently evidenced market activity to the prices provided by consensus pricing services. UBS also 
uses internally developed models, which are typically based on valuation methods and techniques recognized as standard 
within the industry. Assumptions and inputs used in valuation techniques include benchmark interest rate curves, credit 
and funding spreads used in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, equity index prices, foreign exchange 
rates, levels of market volatility and correlation. Refer to Note 21e for more information. The discount curves used by the 
Group incorporate the funding and credit characteristics of the instruments to which they are applied.
Financial instruments excluding derivatives: valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy
Product Valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy
Valuation – Generally valued using prices obtained directly from the market.
– Instruments not priced directly using active-market data are valued using discounted cash flow 
valuation techniques that incorporate market data for similar government instruments. 
Government bills 
and bonds
Fair value hierarchy – Generally traded in active markets with prices that can be obtained directly from these markets, 
resulting in classification as Level 1, while the remaining positions are classified as Level 2 and Level 3.
Valuation – Generally valued using prices obtained directly from the market for the security, or similar securities, 
adjusted for seniority, maturity and liquidity.
– When prices are not available, instruments are valued using discounted cash flow valuation 
techniques incorporating the credit spread of the issuer or similar issuers.
– For convertible bonds without directly comparable prices, issuances may be priced using a convertible 
bond model.
Corporate and 
municipal bonds
Fair value hierarchy – Generally classified as Level 1 or Level 2, depending on the depth of trading activity behind price 
sources.
– Level 3 instruments have no suitable pricing information available.
Valuation – Valued directly using market prices that reflect recent transactions or quoted dealer prices, where 
available.
– Where no market price data is available, loans are valued by relative value benchmarking using 
pricing derived from debt instruments in comparable entities or different products in the same entity, 
or by using a credit default swap valuation technique, which requires inputs for credit spreads, credit 
recovery rates and interest rates. 
– Securitization lending facilities are valued using a discounted cashflow analysis that incorporates 
adjustments for any bespoke features of the loan and collateral. Recently originated commercial real 
estate loans are measured using a securitization approach based on rating agency guidelines.
Traded loans and 
loans measured at 
fair value
Fair value hierarchy – Instruments with suitably deep and liquid pricing information are classified as Level 2.
– Positions requiring the use of valuation techniques, or for which the price sources have insufficient 
trading depth, are classified as Level 3.
Valuation – Predominantly exchange-traded, with readily available quoted prices in liquid markets. Where market 
prices are not available, fair value may be measured using net asset values (NAVs).
Investment fund 
units
Fair value hierarchy – Listed units are classified as Level 1, provided there is sufficient trading activity to justify active-market 
classification, while other positions are classified as Level 2.
– Positions for which NAVs are not available, or where the unit or underlying investments are illiquid 
are classified as Level 3.
Valuation – For liquid securities, the valuation process will use trade and price data, updated for movements in 
market levels between the time of trading and the time of valuation. Less liquid instruments are 
measured using discounted expected cash flows incorporating price data for instruments or indices 
with similar risk profiles.
Asset-backed 
securities (ABS)
Fair value hierarchy – Residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other ABS are 
generally classified as Level 2. However, if significant inputs are unobservable, or if market or 
fundamental data is not available, they are classified as Level 3.
Valuation – ARS are valued utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology. The model captures interest rate risk 
emanating from the note coupon, credit risk attributable to the underlying closed-end fund 
investments, liquidity risk as a function of the level of trading volume in these positions, and 
extension risk, as ARS are perpetual instruments that require an assumption regarding their maturity 
or issuer redemption date. 
Auction rate 
securities (ARS)
Fair value hierarchy – Granular and liquid pricing information is generally not available for ARS. As a result, these securities 
are classified as Level 3.
Valuation – Listed equity instruments are generally valued using prices obtained directly from the market.
– Unlisted equity holdings, including private equity positions, are initially marked at their transaction 
price and are revalued when reliable evidence of price movement becomes available or when the 
position is deemed to be impaired. 
Equity instruments
Fair value hierarchy – The majority of equity securities are actively traded on public stock exchanges where quoted prices 
are readily and regularly available, resulting in Level 1 classification.
– Equity securities less actively traded will be classified as Level 2 and illiquid positions as Level 3.
Financial assets for Valuation – The majority of assets are listed on exchanges and fair values are determined using quoted prices.
unit-linked 
investment 
contracts
Fair value hierarchy – Most assets are classified as Level 1 if actively traded or Level 2 if trading is not active.
– Instruments for which prices are not readily available are classified as Level 3.

Note 21 Fair value measurement (continued)
Product Valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy
Valuation – These instruments are valued using discounted expected cash flow techniques. The discount rate 
applied is based on funding curves that are relevant to the collateral eligibility terms.
Securities 
financing 
transactions Fair value hierarchy – Collateral funding curves for these instruments are generally observable and, as a result, these 
positions are classified as Level 2.
– Where the collateral terms are non-standard, the funding curve may be considered unobservable 
and these positions are classified as Level 3.
Brokerage Valuation – Fair value is determined based on the value of the underlying balances.
receivables and 
payables Fair value hierarchy – Due to their on-demand nature, these receivables and payables are deemed as Level 2.
Valuation – The fair values of investment contract liabilities are determined by reference to the fair value of the 
corresponding assets.
Financial liabilities 
related to unitlinked investment 
contracts
Fair value hierarchy – The liabilities themselves are not actively traded but are mainly referenced to instruments that are 
actively traded and are therefore classified as Level 2.
Precious metals Valuation – Physical assets are valued using the spot rate observed in the relevant market.
and other physical 
commodities Fair value hierarchy – Generally traded in active markets with prices that can be obtained directly from these markets, 
resulting in classification as Level 1.
Valuation – The risk management and the valuation approaches for these instruments are closely aligned with 
the equivalent derivatives business and the underlying risk, and the valuation techniques used for 
this component are the same as the relevant valuation techniques described below.
Debt issued 
designated at fair 
value
Fair value hierarchy – The observability is closely aligned with the equivalent derivatives business and the underlying risk.
Valuation – Generally valued using discounted cash flow valuation techniques incorporating the spread of the 
issuer or similar issuers over the underlying currency risk-free curve.
Commercial paper 
and certificates of 
deposit
Fair value hierarchy – Due to the short-dated nature of the positions and liquid underlying pricing inputs they are generally 
classified as Level 2.
Derivative instruments: valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy
The curves used for discounting expected cash flows in the valuation of collateralized derivatives reflect the funding terms 
associated with the relevant collateral arrangement for the instrument being valued. These collateral arrangements differ 
across counterparties with respect to the eligible currency and interest terms of the collateral. The majority of 
collateralized derivatives are measured using a discount curve based on funding rates derived from overnight interest in 
the cheapest eligible currency for the respective counterparty collateral agreement.
Uncollateralized and partially collateralized derivatives are discounted using the alternative reference rate (the ARR) (or 
equivalent) curve for the currency of the instrument. As described in Note 21d, the fair value of uncollateralized and 
partially collateralized derivatives is then adjusted by credit valuation adjustments (CVAs), debit valuation adjustments 
(DVAs) and funding valuation adjustments (FVAs), as applicable, to reflect an estimation of the effect of counterparty 
credit risk, UBS’s own credit risk, and funding costs and benefits.
› Refer to Note 11 for more information about derivative instruments
Derivative product Valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy
Valuation – Interest rate swap contracts are valued by estimating future interest cash flows and discounting those 
cash flows using a rate that reflects the appropriate funding rate for the position being measured. 
The yield curves used to estimate future index levels and discount rates are generated using marketstandard yield curve models using interest rates associated with current market activity. The key 
inputs to the models are interest rate swap rates, forward rate agreement rates, short-term interest 
rate futures prices, basis swap spreads and inflation swap rates.
– Interest rate option contracts are valued using various market-standard option models, using inputs 
that include interest rate yield curves, inflation curves, volatilities and correlations.
– When the maturity of an interest rate swap or option contract exceeds the term for which standard 
market quotes are observable for a significant input parameter, the contracts are valued by 
extrapolation from the last observable point using standard assumptions or by reference to another 
observable comparable input parameter to represent a suitable proxy for that portion of the term.
Interest rate 
contracts
Fair value hierarchy – The majority of interest rate swaps are classified as Level 2, as the standard market contracts that 
form the inputs for yield curve models are generally traded in active and observable markets.
– Options are generally treated as Level 2, as the calibration process enables the model output to be 
validated to active-market levels. Models calibrated in this way are then used to revalue the portfolio 
of both standard options and more exotic products.
– Interest rate swap or option contracts are classified as Level 3 when the terms exceed standard 
market-observable quotes.
– Exotic options for which appropriate volatility or correlation input levels cannot be implied from 
observable market data are classified as Level 3.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 363
Note 21 Fair value measurement (continued)
Derivative product Valuation and classification in the fair value hierarchy
Valuation – Credit derivative contracts are valued using industry-standard models based primarily on market 
credit spreads, upfront pricing points and implied recovery rates. Where a derivative credit spread is 
not directly available, it may be derived from the price of the reference cash bond. 
– Asset-backed credit derivatives are valued using a valuation technique similar to that of the 
underlying security with an adjustment to reflect the funding differences between cash and synthetic 
form.
Credit derivative 
contracts
Fair value hierarchy – Single-entity and portfolio credit derivative contracts are classified as Level 2 when credit spreads 
and recovery rates are determined from actively traded observable market data. Where the 
underlying reference name(s) are not actively traded and the correlation cannot be directly mapped 
to actively traded tranche instruments, these contracts are classified as Level 3. 
– Asset-backed credit derivatives follow the characteristics of the underlying security and are therefore 
distributed across Level 2 and Level 3.
Valuation – Open spot foreign exchange (FX) contracts are valued using the FX spot rate observed in the market.
– Forward FX contracts are valued using the FX spot rate adjusted for forward pricing points observed 
from standard market-based sources.
– Over-the-counter (OTC) FX option contracts are valued using market-standard option valuation 
models. The models used for shorter-dated options (i.e., maturities of five years or less) tend to be 
different than those used for longer-dated options because the models needed for longer-dated OTC 
FX contracts require additional consideration of interest rate and FX rate interdependency.
– The valuation for multi-dimensional FX options uses a multi-local volatility model, which is calibrated 
to the observed FX volatilities for all relevant FX pairs.
Foreign exchange 
contracts
Fair value hierarchy – The markets for FX spot and FX forward pricing points are both actively traded and observable and 
therefore such FX contracts are generally classified as Level 2. 
– A significant proportion of OTC FX option contracts are classified as Level 2 as inputs are derived 
mostly from standard market contracts traded in active and observable markets.
Valuation – Equity forward contracts have a single stock or index underlying and are valued using marketstandard models. The key inputs to the models are stock prices, estimated dividend rates and equity 
funding rates (which are implied from prices of forward contracts observed in the market). Estimated 
cash flows are then discounted using market-standard discounted cash flow models using a rate that 
reflects the appropriate funding rate for that portion of the portfolio. When no market data is 
available for the instrument maturity, they are valued by extrapolation of available data, use of 
historical dividend data, or use of data for a related equity. 
– Equity option contracts are valued using market-standard models that estimate the equity forward 
level as described for equity forward contracts and incorporate inputs for stock volatility and for 
correlation between stocks within a basket. The probability-weighted expected option payoff 
generated is then discounted using market-standard discounted cash flow models applying a rate 
that reflects the appropriate funding rate for that portion of the portfolio. When volatility, forward 
or correlation inputs are not available, they are valued using extrapolation of available data, historical 
dividend, correlation or volatility data, or the equivalent data for a related equity.
Equity / index 
contracts
Fair value hierarchy – As inputs are derived mostly from standard market contracts traded in active and observable markets, 
a significant proportion of equity forward contracts are classified as Level 2. 
– Equity option positions for which inputs are derived from standard market contracts traded in active 
and observable markets are also classified as Level 2. Level 3 positions are those for which volatility, 
forward or correlation inputs are not observable.
Valuation – Commodity forward and swap contracts are measured using market-standard models that use 
market forward levels on standard instruments. 
– Commodity option contracts are measured using market-standard option models that estimate the 
commodity forward level as described for commodity forward and swap contracts, incorporating 
inputs for the volatility of the underlying index or commodity. For commodity options on baskets of 
commodities or bespoke commodity indices, the valuation technique also incorporates inputs for the 
correlation between different commodities or commodity indices.
Commodity 
contracts
Fair value hierarchy – Individual commodity contracts are typically classified as Level 2, because active forward and volatility 
market data is available.
Valuation – Valued directly using market prices that reflect recent transactions or quoted dealer prices, where 
available.
– Where no market price data is available, loan commitments are valued by relative value 
benchmarking using pricing derived from debt instruments in comparable entities or different 
products in the same entity, or by using a credit default swap valuation technique, which requires 
inputs for credit spreads, credit recovery rates and interest rates.
Loan commitments 
measured at FVTPL
Fair value hierarchy – Instruments with suitably deep and liquid pricing information are classified as Level 2.
– Positions requiring the use of valuation techniques, or for which the price sources have insufficient 
trading depth, are classified as Level 3.

Note 21 Fair value measurement (continued)
d) Valuation adjustments and other items
The output of a valuation technique is always an estimate of a fair value that cannot be measured with complete certainty. 
As a result, valuations are adjusted where appropriate and when such factors would be considered by market participants 
in estimating fair value, to reflect close-out costs, credit exposure, model-driven valuation uncertainty, funding costs and 
benefits, trading restrictions and other factors. 
Deferred day-1 profit or loss reserves
For new transactions where the valuation technique used to measure fair value requires significant inputs that are not 
based on observable market data, the financial instrument is initially recognized at the transaction price. The transaction 
price may differ from the fair value obtained using a valuation technique, where any such difference is deferred and not 
initially recognized in the income statement. 
Deferred day-1 profit or loss is generally released into Other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value 
through profit or loss when pricing of equivalent products or the underlying parameters becomes observable or when 
the transaction is closed out.
The table below summarizes the changes in deferred day-1 profit or loss reserves during the respective period. In 
accordance with IFRS, no day-1 profit or loss reserves were recognized on positions acquired with the Credit Suisse Group 
and no significant new positions were originated between the acquisition date and 31 December 2023.

Own credit 
Own credit risk is reflected in the valuation of UBS’s fair value option liabilities where this component is considered 
relevant for valuation purposes by UBS’s counterparties and other market participants.
Changes in the fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss related to own credit are 
recognized in Other comprehensive income directly within Retained earnings, with no reclassification to the income 
statement in future periods. This presentation does not create or increase an accounting mismatch in the income 
statement, as the Group does not hedge changes in own credit.
Own credit is estimated using own credit adjustment (OCA) curves, which incorporate observable market data, including 
market-observed secondary prices for UBS’s debt and debt curves of peers. In the table below, the change in unrealized 
own credit consists of changes in fair value that are attributable to the change in UBS’s credit spreads, as well as the 
effect of changes in fair values attributable to factors other than credit spreads, such as redemptions, effects from time 
decay and changes in interest and other market rates. Realized own credit is recognized when an instrument with an 
associated unrealized OCA is repurchased prior to the contractual maturity date. Life-to-date amounts reflect the 
cumulative unrealized change since initial recognition.

Note 21 Fair value measurement (continued)
Credit valuation adjustments
In order to measure the fair value of OTC derivative instruments, including funded derivative instruments that are 
classified as Financial assets at fair value not held for trading, CVAs are needed to reflect the credit risk of the counterparty 
inherent in these instruments. This amount represents the estimated fair value of protection required to hedge the 
counterparty credit risk of such instruments. A CVA is determined for each counterparty, considering all exposures with 
that counterparty, and is dependent on the expected future value of exposures, default probabilities and recovery rates, 
applicable collateral or netting arrangements, break clauses, funding spreads, and other contractual factors. 
Funding valuation adjustments
FVAs reflect the costs and benefits of funding associated with uncollateralized and partially collateralized derivative 
receivables and payables and are calculated as the valuation effect from moving the discounting of the uncollateralized 
derivative cash flows from the ARR to OCA using the CVA framework, including the probability of counterparty default. 
An FVA is also applied to collateralized derivative assets in cases where the collateral cannot be sold or repledged.
Debit valuation adjustments
A DVA is estimated to incorporate own credit in the valuation of derivatives where an FVA is not already recognized. The 
DVA calculation is effectively consistent with the CVA framework, being determined for each counterparty, considering 
all exposures with that counterparty and taking into account collateral netting agreements, expected future mark-tomarket movements and UBS’s credit default spreads.
Other valuation adjustments
Instruments that are measured as part of a portfolio of combined long and short positions are valued at mid-market levels 
to ensure consistent valuation of the long- and short-component risks. A liquidity valuation adjustment is then made to 
the overall net long or short exposure to move the fair value to bid or offer as appropriate, reflecting current levels of 
market liquidity. The bid–offer spreads used in the calculation of this valuation adjustment are obtained from market 
transactions and other relevant sources and are updated periodically.
Uncertainties associated with the use of model-based valuations are incorporated into the measurement of fair value 
through the use of model reserves. These reserves reflect the amounts that the Group estimates should be deducted 
from valuations produced directly by models to incorporate uncertainties in the relevant modeling assumptions, in the 
model and market inputs used, or in the calibration of the model output to adjust for known model deficiencies. In 
arriving at these estimates, the Group considers a range of market practices, including how it believes market participants 
would assess these uncertainties. Model reserves are reassessed periodically in light of data from market transactions, 
consensus pricing services and other relevant sources.

e) Level 3 instruments: valuation techniques and inputs 
The table below presents material Level 3 assets and liabilities, together with the valuation techniques used to measure 
fair value, the inputs used in a given valuation technique that are considered significant as of 31 December 2023 and 
unobservable, and a range of values for those unobservable inputs. 
The range of values represents the highest- and lowest-level inputs used in the valuation techniques. Therefore, the range 
does not reflect the level of uncertainty regarding a particular input or an assessment of the reasonableness of the 
Group’s estimates and assumptions, but rather the different underlying characteristics of the relevant assets and liabilities 
held by the Group. The ranges will therefore vary from period to period and parameter to parameter based on 
characteristics of the instruments held at each balance sheet date. Furthermore, the ranges of unobservable inputs may 
differ across other financial institutions, reflecting the diversity of the products in each firm’s inventory.

1 The ranges of significant unobservable inputs are represented in points, percentages and basis points. Points are a percentage of par (e.g., 100 points would be 100% of par). 2 Weighted averages are provided 
for most non-derivative financial instruments and were calculated by weighting inputs based on the fair values of the respective instruments. Weighted averages are not provided for inputs related to Other financial 
liabilities designated at fair value and Derivative financial instruments, as this would not be meaningful. 3 The range of inputs is not disclosed, as there is a dispersion of values given the diverse nature of the 
investments. 4 Debt issued designated at fair value primarily consists of UBS structured notes, which include variable maturity notes with various equity and foreign exchange underlying risks, as well as rates-linked 
and credit-linked notes, all of which have embedded derivative parameters that are considered to be unobservable. The equivalent derivative instrument parameters for debt issued or embedded derivatives for overthe-counter debt instruments are presented in the respective derivative financial instruments lines in this table.

Significant unobservable inputs in Level 3 positions
This section discusses the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of Level 3 instruments and assesses the 
potential effect that a change in each unobservable input in isolation may have on a fair value measurement. Relationships 
between observable and unobservable inputs have not been included in the summary below.
Input Description
Bond price 
equivalent
– Where market prices are not available for a bond, fair value is measured by comparison with observable pricing data from 
similar instruments. Factors considered when selecting comparable instruments include credit quality, maturity and industry 
of the issuer. Fair value may be measured either by a direct price comparison or by conversion of an instrument price into a 
yield (either as an outright yield or as a spread to the relevant benchmark rate). 
– For corporate and municipal bonds, the range represents the range of prices from reference issuances used in determining 
fair value. Bonds priced at 0 are distressed to the point that no recovery is expected, while prices significantly in excess of 
100 or par relate to inflation-linked or structured issuances that pay a coupon in excess of the market benchmark as of the 
measurement date.
– For credit derivatives, the bond price range represents the range of prices used for reference instruments, which are typically 
converted to an equivalent yield or credit spread as part of the valuation process.
Loan price 
equivalent
– Where market prices are not available for a traded loan or a loan commitment, fair value is measured by comparison with 
observable pricing data for similar instruments. Factors considered when selecting comparable instruments include industry 
segment, collateral quality, maturity and issuer-specific covenants. Fair value may be measured either by a direct price 
comparison or by conversion of an instrument price into a yield. The range represents the range of prices derived from 
reference issuances of a similar credit quality used to measure fair value for loans classified as Level 3. Loans priced at 0 are 
distressed to the point that no recovery is expected, while a current price of 100 represents a loan that is expected to be 
repaid in full.
Credit spread – Valuation models for many credit derivatives and other credit sensitive products require an input for the credit spread, which 
is a reflection of the credit quality of the associated referenced underlying. The credit spread of a particular security is quoted 
in relation to the yield on a benchmark security or reference rate, typically either US Treasury or ARR, and is generally expressed 
in terms of basis points. An increase / (decrease) in credit spread will increase / (decrease) the value of credit protection offered 
by credit default swaps and other credit derivative products. The income statement effect from such changes depends on the 
nature and direction of the positions held. Credit spreads may be negative where the asset is more creditworthy than the 
benchmark against which the spread is calculated. A wider credit spread represents decreasing creditworthiness. The range 
represents a diverse set of underlyings, with the lower end of the range representing credits of the highest quality and the 
upper end of the range representing greater levels of credit risk.
Discount margin – The discount margin (DM) spread represents the discount rates applied to present value cash flows of an asset to reflect the 
market return required for uncertainty in the estimated cash flows. DM spreads are a rate or rates applied on top of a floating 
index (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)) to discount expected cash flows. Generally, a decrease / (increase) in 
the DM in isolation would result in a higher / (lower) fair value.
– The high end of the range relates to securities that are priced low within the market relative to the expected cash flow 
schedule. This indicates that the market is pricing an increased risk of credit loss into the security that is greater than what is 
being captured by the expected cash flow generation process. The low ends of the ranges are typical of funding rates on 
better-quality instruments.
Funding spread – Structured financing transactions are valued using synthetic funding curves that best represent the assets that are pledged as 
collateral for the transactions. They are not representative of where UBS can fund itself on an unsecured basis but provide an 
estimate of where UBS can source and deploy secured funding with counterparties for a given type of collateral. The funding 
spreads are expressed in terms of basis points, and if funding spreads widen, this increases the effect of discounting. 
– A small proportion of structured debt instruments and non-structured fixed-rate bonds within financial liabilities designated 
at fair value had an exposure to funding spreads that was longer in duration than the actively traded market.
Volatility – Volatility measures the variability of future prices for a particular instrument and is generally expressed as a percentage, where 
a higher number reflects a more volatile instrument, for which future price movements are more likely to occur. Volatility is 
a key input into option models, where it is used to derive a probability-based distribution of future prices for the underlying 
instrument. The effect of volatility on individual positions within the portfolio is driven primarily by whether the option 
contract is a long or short position. In most cases, the fair value of an option increases as a result of an increase in volatility 
and is reduced by a decrease in volatility. Generally, volatility used in the measurement of fair value is derived from activemarket option prices (referred to as implied volatility). A key feature of implied volatility is the volatility “smile” or “skew,” 
which represents the effect of pricing options of different option strikes at different implied volatility levels.
– Volatilities of low interest rates tend to be much higher than volatilities of high interest rates. In addition, different currencies 
may have significantly different implied volatilities. 
Recovery Rate – The projected recovery rate reflects the estimated recovery that will be realized given expected defaults, it is an analogous 
pricing input for corporate or sovereign credits. Reduction in recovery rates will result in lower expected cash flows into the 
structure upon the default of the instruments. In general, a significant increase / (decrease) in the recovery rate in isolation 
would result in significantly higher / (lower) fair value for the respective underlying cash security. The impact of a change in 
recovery rate on a credit derivative position will depend on whether credit protection has been bought or sold. Recovery rate 
is ultimately driven by the value recoverable from collateral held after default occurs relative to the outstanding exposure at 
that point.
Gap risk – Gap risk is a risk of unexpected large declines in the underlying collateral values occurring between collateral settlement 
dates. Gap risk is a significant unobservable input for structures that exhibit market risk to significant price moves in the 
reference asset, generally related to certain financing or principal protection trade features. In general, for assets / (liabilities) 
with a significant unobservable input of gap risk, an increase in gap risk in isolation would decrease / (increase) the fair value.

Note 21 Fair value measurement (continued)
Input Description
Correlation – Correlation measures the interrelationship between the movements of two variables. It is expressed as a percentage between 
–100% and +100%, where +100% represents perfectly correlated variables (meaning a movement of one variable is 
associated with a movement of the other variable in the same direction) and –100% implies that the variables are inversely 
correlated (meaning a movement of one variable is associated with a movement of the other variable in the opposite 
direction). The effect of correlation on the measurement of fair value depends on the specific terms of the instruments being 
valued, reflecting the range of different payoff features within such instruments.
Equity dividend 
yields
– The derivation of a forward price for an individual stock or index is important for measuring fair value for forward or swap 
contracts and for measuring fair value using option pricing models. The relationship between the current stock price and the 
forward price is based on a combination of expected future dividend levels and payment timings, and, to a lesser extent, the 
relevant funding rates applicable to the stock in question. Dividend yields are generally expressed as an annualized percentage 
of the share price, with the lowest limit of 0% representing a stock that is not expected to pay any dividend. The dividend 
yield and timing represent the most significant parameter in determining fair value for instruments that are sensitive to an 
equity forward price.
f) Level 3 instruments: sensitivity to changes in unobservable input assumptions
The table below summarizes those financial assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 for which a change in one or more 
of the unobservable inputs to reflect reasonably possible favorable and unfavorable alternative assumptions would 
change fair value significantly, and the estimated effect thereof. The table below does not represent the estimated effect 
of stress scenarios. Interdependencies between Level 1, 2 and 3 parameters have not been incorporated in the table. 
Furthermore, direct interrelationships between the Level 3 parameters discussed below are not a significant element of 
the valuation uncertainty.
Sensitivity data is estimated using a number of techniques, including the estimation of price dispersion among different 
market participants, variation in modeling approaches and reasonably possible changes to assumptions used within the 
fair value measurement process. The sensitivity ranges are not always symmetrical around the fair values, as the inputs 
used in valuations are not always precisely in the middle of the favorable and unfavorable range.
Sensitivity data is determined at a product or parameter level and then aggregated assuming no diversification benefit. 
Diversification would incorporate estimated correlations across different sensitivity results and, as such, would result in 
an overall sensitivity that would be less than the sum of the individual component sensitivities. However, the Group 
believes that the diversification benefit is not significant to this analysis.
The increase in Traded loans sensitivity to favorable and unfavorable changes is due to an increase in Level 3 loan balances 
from Credit Suisse including, securitization warehouse facilities, a loan with securitization collateral and revolving loan 
facilities that are deemed unobservable.

g) Level 3 instruments: movements during the period
The table below presents additional information about material Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a 
recurring basis. Level 3 assets and liabilities may be hedged with instruments classified as Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value 
hierarchy, and, as a result, realized and unrealized gains and losses included in the table may not include the effect of related 
hedging activity. Furthermore, the realized and unrealized gains and losses presented in the table are not limited solely to 
those arising from Level 3 inputs, as valuations are generally derived from both observable and unobservable parameters.

h) Maximum exposure to credit risk for financial instruments measured at fair value
The tables below provide the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for financial instruments measured at fair value 
and the respective collateral and other credit enhancements mitigating credit risk for these classes of financial 
instruments. 
The maximum exposure to credit risk includes the carrying amounts of financial instruments recognized on the balance 
sheet subject to credit risk and the notional amounts for off-balance sheet arrangements. Where information is available, 
collateral is presented at fair value. For other collateral, such as real estate, a reasonable alternative value is used. Credit 
enhancements, such as credit derivative contracts and guarantees, are included at their notional amounts. Both are 
capped at the maximum exposure to credit risk for which they serve as security. The “Risk management and control” 
section of this report describes management’s view of credit risk and the related exposures, which can differ in certain 
respects from the requirements of IFRS Accounting Standards.

1 Includes certain financial instruments where the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of the fair value due to the instruments’ short-term nature (instruments that are receivable or payable on demand or 
with a remaining maturity (excluding the effects of callable features) of three months or less). 2 Excludes lease liabilities.
The fair values included in the table above have been calculated for disclosure purposes only. The valuation techniques 
and assumptions described below relate only to the fair value of UBS’s financial instruments not measured at fair value. 
Other institutions may use different methods and assumptions for their fair value estimations, and therefore such fair 
value disclosures cannot necessarily be compared from one financial institution to another. The following principles were 
applied when determining fair value estimates for financial instruments not measured at fair value.
– For financial instruments with remaining maturities greater than three months, the fair value was determined from 
quoted market prices, if available.
– Where quoted market prices were not available, the fair values were estimated by discounting contractual cash flows 
using current market interest rates or appropriate yield curves for instruments with similar credit risk and maturity. 
These estimates generally include adjustments for counterparty credit risk or UBS’s own credit.
– For short-term financial instruments with remaining maturities of three months or less, the carrying amount, which is 
net of credit loss allowances, is generally considered a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Note 22 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities
UBS enters into netting agreements with counterparties to manage the credit risks associated primarily with repurchase 
and reverse repurchase transactions, securities borrowing and lending, over-the-counter derivatives, and exchangetraded derivatives. These netting agreements and similar arrangements generally enable the counterparties to set off 
liabilities against available assets received in the ordinary course of business and / or in the event that the counterparties 
to the transaction are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations. 
The tables below provide a summary of financial assets and financial liabilities subject to offsetting, enforceable master 
netting arrangements and similar agreements, as well as financial collateral received or pledged to mitigate credit 
exposures for these financial instruments. 
The Group engages in a variety of counterparty credit risk mitigation strategies in addition to netting and collateral 
arrangements. Therefore, the net amounts presented in the tables below do not purport to represent their actual credit 
risk exposure.

Note 23 Restricted and transferred financial assets
This Note provides information about restricted financial assets (Note 23a), transfers of financial assets (Note 23b and 
23c) and financial assets that are received as collateral with the right to resell or repledge these assets (Note 23d).
a) Restricted financial assets
Restricted financial assets consist of assets pledged as collateral against an existing liability or contingent liability and 
other assets that are otherwise explicitly restricted such that they cannot be used to secure funding. 
Financial assets pledged as collateral mainly include pledged mortgage loans, which serve as collateral for existing 
liabilities against the Swiss National Bank (the SNB) in relation to the Emergency Liquidity Assistance facility, against loans 
from Swiss mortgage institutions and US Federal Home Loan Banks, and in connection with the issuance of covered 
bonds. Of these pledged mortgage loans, approximately USD 7.5bn as of 31 December 2023 could be withdrawn or 
used for future liabilities or covered bond issuances without breaching existing collateral requirements (31 December 
2022: approximately USD 3.1bn). Existing liabilities in relation to the Emergency Liquidity Assistance facility against the 
SNB were USD 44.9bn as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: USD 0bn). Liabilities against Swiss central mortgage 
institutions and US Federal Home Loan Banks, and for existing covered bond issuances were USD 45.5bn as of 31 
December 2023 (31 December 2022: USD 9.0bn).
Other financial assets are pledged as collateral in relation to securities lending transactions and in repurchase transactions, 
which are generally entered into under standard market agreements. For securities lending, the cash received as collateral 
may be more or less than the fair value of the securities loaned, depending on the nature of the transaction. For 
repurchase agreements, the fair value of the collateral sold under an agreement to repurchase is generally in excess of 
the cash borrowed.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 374
Note 23 Restricted and transferred financial assets (continued)
Other restricted financial assets include assets protected under client asset segregation rules, assets held under unit-linked 
investment contracts to back related liabilities to the policy holders and assets held in certain jurisdictions to comply with 
explicit minimum local asset maintenance requirements. The carrying amount of the liabilities associated with these other 
restricted financial assets is generally equal to the carrying amount of the assets, with the exception of assets held to 
comply with local asset maintenance requirements, for which the associated liabilities are greater.

1 Assets pledged to the depositor protection system in Switzerland following new requirements that became effective in 2023. 2 Predominantly includes cash collateral provided to exchanges and clearing houses 
to secure securities trading activity through those counterparties. 3 Does not include assets placed with central banks related to undrawn credit lines and for payment, clearing and settlement purposes (31 December 
2023: USD 9.8bn; 31 December 2022: USD 5.9bn). 4 Refer to Note 2 for more information about the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
In addition to the table above, USD 7.1bn were placed at central banks to meet local statutory minimum reserve 
requirements as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: USD 4.4bn).
In addition to restrictions on financial assets, UBS Group AG and its subsidiaries are, in certain cases, subject to regulatory 
requirements that affect the transfer of dividends and capital within the Group, as well as intercompany lending. 
Supervisory authorities also may require entities to measure capital and leverage ratios on a stressed basis, such as the 
Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, which may limit the relevant 
subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions of capital based on the results of those tests.
Supervisory authorities generally have discretion to impose higher requirements or to otherwise limit the activities of 
subsidiaries. 
Non-regulated subsidiaries are generally not subject to such requirements and transfer restrictions. However, restrictions 
can also be the result of different legal, regulatory, contractual, entity- or country-specific arrangements and / or 
requirements.

1 Refer to Note 2 for more information about the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
Transactions in which financial assets are transferred but continue to be recognized in their entirety on UBS’s balance 
sheet include securities lending and repurchase agreements, as well as other financial asset transfers. Repurchase and 
securities lending arrangements are, for the most part, conducted under standard market agreements and are undertaken 
with counterparties subject to UBS’s normal credit risk control processes. 
› Refer to Note 1a item 2e for more information about repurchase and securities lending agreements
Financial assets at fair value held for trading that may be sold or repledged by counterparties include securities lending 
and repurchase agreements in exchange for cash received, securities lending agreements in exchange for securities 
received and other financial asset transfers.
For securities lending and repurchase agreements, a haircut of between 0% and 15% is generally applied to the 
transferred assets, which results in associated liabilities having a carrying amount below the carrying amount of the 
transferred assets. The counterparties to the associated liabilities included in the table above have full recourse to UBS.
In securities lending arrangements entered into in exchange for the receipt of other securities as collateral, neither the 
securities received nor the obligation to return them are recognized on UBS’s balance sheet, as the risks and rewards of 
ownership are not transferred to UBS. In cases where such financial assets received are subsequently sold or repledged 
in another transaction, this is not considered to be a transfer of financial assets.
Other financial asset transfers primarily include securities transferred to collateralize derivative transactions, for which the 
carrying amount of associated liabilities is not included in the table above, because those replacement values are managed 
on a portfolio basis across counterparties and product types, and therefore there is no direct relationship between the 
specific collateral pledged and the associated liability.
Transferred financial assets that are not subject to derecognition in full but remain on the balance sheet to the extent of 
the Group’s continuing involvement were not material as of 31 December 2023 and as of 31 December 2022. 
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 376
Note 23 Restricted and transferred financial assets (continued)
c) Transferred financial assets that are derecognized in their entirety with continuing involvement
Continuing involvement in a transferred and fully derecognized financial asset may result from contractual provisions in 
the particular transfer agreement or from a separate agreement, with the counterparty or a third party, entered into in 
connection with the transfer. 
The fair value and carrying amount of UBS’s continuing involvement from transferred positions as of 31 December 2023 
and 31 December 2022 was not material. Life-to-date losses reported in prior periods primarily relate to legacy positions 
in securitization vehicles that have been fully marked down, with no remaining exposure to loss.
d) Off-balance sheet assets received
The table below presents assets received from third parties that can be sold or repledged and that are not recognized on 
the balance sheet but that are held as collateral, including amounts that have been sold or repledged.

purposes for which there are no associated liabilities or contingent liabilities. 3 Refer to Note 2 for more information about the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.
Note 24 Maturity analysis of assets and liabilities
a) Maturity analysis of carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
The table below provides an analysis of carrying amounts of balance sheet assets and liabilities, as well as off-balance 
sheet exposures by residual contractual maturity as of the reporting date. The residual contractual maturity of assets 
includes the effect of callable features. The residual contractual maturity of liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures is 
based on the earliest date on which a third party could require UBS to pay.
Derivative financial instruments and financial assets and liabilities at fair value held for trading are presented in the Due 
within 1 month column; however, the respective contractual maturities may extend over significantly longer periods.
Assets held to hedge unit-linked investment contracts (presented within Financial assets at fair value not held for trading) 
are presented in the Due within 1 month column, consistent with the maturity assigned to the related amounts due 
under unit-linked investment contracts (presented within Other financial liabilities designated at fair value).
Other financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity, such as equity securities, are presented in the Perpetual / 
Not applicable column. Undated or perpetual instruments are classified based on the contractual notice period that the 
counterparty of the instrument is entitled to give. Where there is no contractual notice period, undated or perpetual 
contracts are presented in the Perpetual / Not applicable column.
Non-financial assets and liabilities with no contractual maturity are generally included in the Perpetual / Not applicable
column.

Note 25 Interest rate benchmark reform
During 2023, the Group largely completed the transition of the USD London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) contracts. 
The transition of the largest remaining non-derivative exposure, the US mortgage portfolio of approximately USD 9bn as 
of 31 December 2022, was substantially completed, with these contracts automatically converting to term Secured 
Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) from their next interest rate reset date following the cessation of the respective USD 
LIBOR rates, i.e., 30 June 2023. Corporate loans granted by the Investment Bank and the Investment Bank (Credit Suisse), 
as well as Wealth Management (Credit Suisse), have now also been transitioned to alternative rates, with approximately 
USD 1bn (predominantly attributable to positions acquired through the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group) relying on 
synthetic LIBOR rates. The Group will continue to focus on the transition of the remaining synthetic LIBOR rate exposures 
to alternative rates in 2024.
In August 2022, to facilitate the transition of derivatives linked to the USD LIBOR Swap Rate, the Group adhered to the 
June 2022 Benchmark Module of the ISDA 2021 Fallbacks Protocol on the USD LIBOR Swap Rate. As of 31 December 
2023, the transition of these USD LIBOR-linked derivatives had been materially accomplished. 
The table below sets out the contracts that remained as of 31 December 2022. No contracts are included as of 
31 December 2023 given transition has largely completed as noted above.

1 As of 31 December 2022, non-USD balances and trade counts were minimal. 2 Includes USD 1bn of loans related to revolving multi-currency credit lines, where IBOR transition efforts are complete, except for 
USD LIBOR. The remaining balances as of 31 December 2022 primarily related to US mortgages and corporate lending. 3 Relates to floating-rate notes that per their contractual terms can reset to rates linked to 
LIBOR, with transition dependent upon the actions of respective issuers. 4 Includes approximately 2,000 contracts having a contractual maturity after 30 June 2023, with the last USD LIBOR fixing occurring before 
30 June 2023. No further contractual fixing is required for these contracts. 5 Includes approximately USD 3bn of loan commitments that can be drawn in different currencies; however, only USD LIBOR transition 
efforts remained open as of 31 December 2022.
In addition, as of 31 December 2023 the Group had approximately USD 4bn equivalent of yen- and US dollardenominated publicly issued benchmark bonds that, per current contractual terms, if not called on their respective call 
dates, would reset based directly on JPY LIBOR and USD LIBOR, respectively. Furthermore, certain benchmark bonds 
publicly issued by the Group reference rates indirectly derived from IBORs, if they are not called on their respective call 
dates. Confirmation of interest rate calculation mechanics will be communicated in advance of any rate resets, if 
applicable.
Note 26 Hedge accounting
Derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships
The Group applies hedge accounting to interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, including structural foreign exchange 
risk related to net investments in foreign operations. 
› Refer to “Market risk” in the “Risk management and control” section of this report for more information about how risks arise 
and how they are managed by the Group
Hedging instruments and hedged risk
Interest rate swaps are designated in fair value hedges or cash flow hedges of interest rate risk arising solely from changes 
in benchmark interest rates. Fair value changes arising from such risk are usually the largest component of the overall 
change in the fair value of the hedged position in transaction currency. 
Cross-currency swaps are designated as fair value hedges of foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange forwards and 
foreign exchange swaps are mainly designated as hedges of structural foreign exchange risk related to net investments 
in foreign operations. In both cases the hedged risk arises solely from changes in the spot foreign exchange rate. 
The notional of the designated hedging instruments matches the notional of the hedged items, except when the interest 
rate swaps are designated in cash flow hedges after the trade date, in which case the hedge ratio designated is 
determined based on the swap sensitivity.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 380
Note 26 Hedge accounting (continued)
Hedged items and hedge designation 
Fair value hedges of interest rate risk related to debt instruments and loan assets
Fair value hedges of interest rate risk related to debt instruments and loan assets involve swapping fixed cash flows 
associated with loans to customers (including long-term fixed-rate mortgage loans in Swiss francs), debt securities held, 
customer deposits, or debt issued to floating cash flows by entering into interest rate swaps that either pay fixed and 
receive floating cash flows or that receive fixed and pay floating cash flows. The floating future cash flows are based on 
the following benchmark rates: Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), Effective Federal Funds Rate (EFFR), Swiss 
Average Rate Overnight (SARON), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR), Euro Short-Term Rate (ESTR), Sterling 
Overnight Index Average (SONIA), AUD London Interbank Offered Rate (AUD LIBOR), Tokyo Overnight Average Rate 
(TONA), Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA) and Norwegian Krona Overnight Index Swap (NOK OIS). 
Cash flow hedges of forecast transactions
The Group hedges forecast cash flows on non-trading financial assets and liabilities that bear interest at variable rates or 
are expected to be refinanced or reinvested in the future, due to movements in future market rates. The amounts and 
timing of future cash flows, representing both principal and interest flows, are projected on the basis of contractual terms 
and other relevant factors, including estimates of prepayments and defaults. The aggregate principal balances and 
interest cash flows across all portfolios over time form the basis for identifying the non-trading interest rate risk of the 
Group, which is hedged with interest rate swaps, the maximum maturity of which is 15 years. Cash flow forecasts and 
risk exposures are monitored and adjusted on an ongoing basis, and consequently additional hedging instruments are 
traded and designated, or are terminated resulting in a hedge discontinuance. 
Fair value hedges of foreign exchange risk related to issued debt instruments
Debt instruments denominated in currencies other than the US dollar are designated in fair value hedges of spot foreign 
exchange risk, in addition to and separate from the fair value hedges of interest rate risk. Cross-currency swaps 
economically convert debt instruments denominated in currencies other than the US dollar to US dollars. The hedge 
designations also involve intragroup debt instruments that are eliminated upon consolidation but FX gains and losses 
impact consolidated profit or loss.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations
The Group applies hedge accounting for certain net investments in foreign operations, which include subsidiaries, 
branches and associates. Upon maturity of hedging instruments, typically one to three months, the hedge relationship is 
terminated and new designations are made to reflect any changes in the net investments in foreign operations.
Economic relationship between hedged item and hedging instrument
The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is determined based on a qualitative 
analysis of their critical terms. In cases where hedge designation takes place after the trade date of the hedging 
instrument, a quantitative analysis of the possible behavior of the hedging derivative and the hedged item during their 
respective terms is also performed.
Sources of hedge ineffectiveness 
In hedges of interest rate risk, hedge ineffectiveness can arise from mismatches of critical terms and / or the use of 
different curves to discount the hedged item and instrument, or from entering into a hedge relationship after the trade 
date of the hedging derivative. 
In hedges of foreign exchange risk related to debt issued, hedge ineffectiveness can arise due to the discounting of the 
hedging instruments and undesignated risk components and lack of such discounting and risk components in the hedged 
items. 
In hedges of net investments in foreign operations, ineffectiveness is unlikely unless the hedged net assets fall below the 
designated hedged amount. The exceptions are hedges where the hedging currency is not the same as the currency of 
the foreign operation, where the currency basis may cause ineffectiveness.
Hedge ineffectiveness from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss is recognized in Other net 
income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships 
Non-hedge-accounted derivatives are mandatorily held for trading with all fair value movements taken to Other net 
income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, even when held as an economic hedge 
or to facilitate client clearing. The one exception relates to forward points on certain short- and long-duration foreign 
exchange contracts acting as economic hedges, which are reported in Net interest income.

Interest rate benchmark reform
In 2023, the Group applied the relief provided by Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and 
IFRS 7), published by the International Accounting Standards Board in September 2019, to its hedges in US dollars and 
Singapore dollars until they transitioned to alternative reference rate (ARR) designations in May 2023 and June 2023, 
respectively. The transition of fair value hedges took place following the IBOR transition for swaps with LCH (formerly 
the London Clearing House), with hedge relationships continuing in accordance with Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – 
Phase 2 (Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16). Cash flow hedge relationships were discontinued 
and replaced with new ARR designations in May 2023. 
As of 31 December 2023, there were no hedge relationships where the designated risk is LIBOR and maturing after the 
cessation date of the applicable interest rate benchmarks. The table below provides details on the hedging instruments 
in such hedge relationships as of 31 December 2022.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are not affected by the amendments.

Note 27 Post-employment benefit plans
a) Defined benefit plans
UBS has established defined benefit plans for its employees in various jurisdictions in accordance with local regulations 
and practices. The major plans are in Switzerland, the UK, the US and Germany. The level of benefits depends on the 
specific plan rules.
Swiss pension plans
The Swiss pension plans consist of the UBS Swiss plan and the Credit Suisse Swiss plan, covering employees of UBS Group 
AG in Switzerland and employees of companies in Switzerland that have close economic or financial ties with UBS Group 
AG, and exceed the minimum benefit requirements under Swiss pension law. The Swiss plans offer retirement, disability 
and survivor benefits and are governed by Pension Foundation Boards. The responsibilities of these boards are defined 
by Swiss pension law and the plan rules. The UBS Swiss plan covers contributions for all salary levels. The Credit Suisse 
Swiss plan covers contributions up to a salary of CHF 138,180 (USD 164,169), and contributions above that salary go 
into the Credit Suisse Swiss 1e plan, which is accounted for under IFRS Accounting Standards as a defined contribution 
plan.
Savings contributions to the Swiss plans are paid by both the employer and the employee. For the UBS Swiss plan, 
depending on the age of the employee, UBS pays a savings contribution that ranges between 6.5% and 27.5% of the 
contributory base salary and between 2.8% and 9% of the contributory variable compensation. Employees can choose 
the level of savings contributions paid by them, which vary between 2.5% and 13.5% of the contributory base salary 
and between 0% and 9% of the contributory variable compensation, depending on age and choice of savings 
contribution category. For the Credit Suisse Swiss plan, depending on the age of the employee, UBS pays a savings 
contribution that ranges between 7.5% and 25.0% of the contributory base salary and 6% of the contributory variable 
compensation. Employees can choose the level of savings contributions paid by them, which vary between 5.0% and 
14.0% of the contributory base salary and between 3% and 9% of the contributory variable compensation, depending 
on age and choice of savings contribution category. UBS also pays risk contributions that are used to fund disability and 
survivor benefits.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 383
Note 27 Post-employment benefit plans (continued)
The plans offer to members at the normal retirement age of 65 a choice between a lifetime pension and a partial or full 
lump sum payment. Participants can choose to draw early retirement benefits starting from the age of 58, but they can 
also continue employment and remain active members of the plan until the age of 70. Employees can make additional 
purchases of benefits to fund early retirement benefits.
The pension amount payable to a participant is calculated by applying a conversion rate to the accumulated balance of 
the participant’s retirement savings account at the retirement date. The balance is based on credited vested benefits 
transferred from previous employers, purchases of benefits, employee and employer contributions made to the 
participant’s retirement savings account, and interest accrued. The annual interest rate credited to participants is 
determined by the Pension Foundation Boards at the end of each year.
Although the Swiss plans are based on a defined contribution promise under Swiss pension law, they are accounted for 
as defined benefit plans under IFRS Accounting Standards, primarily because of the obligation to accrue interest on the 
participants’ retirement savings accounts and the payment of lifetime pension benefits.
Actuarial valuations in accordance with Swiss pension law are performed regularly. Should an underfunded situation on 
this basis occur, the Pension Foundation Board of the respective plan is required to take the necessary measures to ensure 
that full funding can be expected to be restored within a maximum period of 10 years. If a Swiss plan were to become 
significantly underfunded on a Swiss pension law basis, additional employer and employee contributions could be 
required. In this situation, the risk is shared between employer and employees, and the employer is not legally obliged to 
cover more than 50% of the additional contributions required. As of 31 December 2023, the technical funding ratio in 
accordance with Swiss pension law was 119.2% at 0.5% technical interest rate for the UBS Swiss plan and 124.0% at 
1.62% technical interest rate for the Credit Suisse Swiss plan (UBS Swiss plan 31 December 2022: 119.0% at 0.5% 
technical interest rate).
The investment strategies of the Swiss plans comply with Swiss pension law, including the rules and regulations relating 
to diversification of plan assets, and are derived from the risk budget defined by the Pension Foundation Boards based 
on regularly performed asset and liability management analyses. The Pension Foundation Boards strive for a mediumand long-term balance between assets and liabilities.
As of 31 December 2023, the Swiss plans were in surplus situations on an IFRS Accounting Standards measurement basis, 
as the fair value of the plan assets exceeded the defined benefit obligation (DBO) by USD 6,332m for the UBS Swiss plan 
and USD 3,150m for the Credit Suisse Swiss plan (UBS Swiss plan 31 December 2022: USD 7,848m, Credit Suisse Swiss 
plan 31 May 2023: USD 3,772m). However, a surplus is only recognized on the balance sheet to the extent that it does 
not exceed the estimated future economic benefit, which equals the difference between the present value of the 
estimated future net service cost and the present value of the estimated future employer contributions. As of both 
31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the estimated future economic benefit of the UBS Swiss plan was zero and 
hence no net defined benefit asset was recognized on the balance sheet; as of 31 December 2023 a net defined benefit 
asset of USD 88m was recognized by UBS for prepaid contributions held at the Credit Suisse Swiss plan (31 May 2023: 
USD 77m).
The regular employer contributions in 2024 are estimated at USD 549m for the UBS Swiss plan and USD 283m for the 
Credit Suisse Swiss plan.
Changes to the Credit Suisse Swiss pension plan
In December 2023, the Pension Foundation Board of the Credit Suisse Swiss plan decided to align the Swiss pension 
scheme to that of the UBS Swiss plan, effective as of 1 January 2027. On that date, the Credit Suisse Swiss plan will 
adopt the plan rules of the UBS Swiss plan. The Credit Suisse Swiss 1e plan will remain in place as of this date, but will 
be closed for further contributions. In accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, these decisions and related mitigating 
measures led to an increase in UBS’s pension obligations in Switzerland resulting in a one-time pre-tax loss of USD 245m 
(CHF 207m) and an offsetting gain in other comprehensive income in the fourth quarter of 2023 with no impact on 
equity and CET1 capital.
UK pension plans
UBS maintains two major pension plans in the UK. The UBS UK plan is a career-average revalued earnings scheme, and 
the Credit Suisse UK plan is a final salary pension scheme. In both plans benefits increase automatically based on UK 
price inflation, subject to defined caps. The normal retirement age for most participants is 60 or 65. The plans provide 
guaranteed lifetime pension benefits to participants upon retirement. The UK plans have been closed to new entrants 
for more than 20 years and participants are no longer accruing benefits for current or future service. Instead, employees 
participate in the UK defined contribution plans.
The governance responsibility for each UK plan lies jointly with the Pension Trustee Board of the respective plan and UBS. 
Both plans invest in diversified portfolios of financial assets. The UBS UK plan assets include swaps to hedge the risk 
between expected and actual longevity. 
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 384
Note 27 Post-employment benefit plans (continued)
In 2019, UBS and the UBS UK Pension Trustee Board entered an arrangement whereby a collateral pool was established 
to provide security for the UBS UK pension fund. The value of the collateral pool as of 31 December 2023 was USD 260m 
(31 December 2022: USD 292m) and includes corporate bonds, government-related debt instruments and other financial 
assets. The arrangement provides the Pension Trustee Board dedicated access to a pool of assets in the event of UBS’s 
insolvency or not paying a required funding contribution. 
The employer contributions to the UBS UK plan reflect agreed-upon funding contributions, determined based on the 
most recent actuarial valuation using assumptions agreed by the Pension Trustee Board and UBS. In 2023, UBS made 
funding contributions of USD 19m to the UBS UK plan (2022: USD 5m). The employer contributions in 2024 are estimated 
at USD 19m for the UBS UK plan, subject to regular funding reviews during the year. 
No contributions were paid to the Credit Suisse UK plan in 2023 or are planned for 2024. The trustees of the Credit 
Suisse UK Pension Fund have agreed to meet the cost of the active members’ contributions into the Credit Suisse UK 
defined contribution plan from the pension assets of the Credit Suisse UK defined benefit plan, which amounted to 
USD 7m in 2023, and such payments are expected to continue in 2024.
US defined benefit plans
There are two main UBS US pension plans and two main Credit Suisse US defined benefit plans, each of which has a 
normal retirement age of 65. All main plans were closed to new entrants more than 20 years ago. Since they closed, new 
employees have participated in defined contribution plans.
One of the UBS defined benefit plans is a contribution-based plan in which each participant accrues a percentage of 
salary in a retirement savings account. The retirement savings account is credited annually with interest based on a rate 
that is linked to the average yield on one-year US government bonds. For the other UBS defined benefit plan, retirement 
benefits accrue based on the career-average earnings of each individual plan participant. Former employees with vested 
benefits can take a lump sum payment or a lifetime annuity. In one of the Credit Suisse defined benefit plans, benefits 
are accrued based on compensation and credited service. The other Credit Suisse defined benefit plan provides unfunded 
health-care benefits for eligible retired employees.
As required under applicable pension laws, the pension plans have fiduciaries who, together with UBS, are responsible 
for the governance of the plans. Each plan’s fiduciaries are responsible for the investment decisions with respect to the 
plan assets. The plan assets of the funded plans are invested in diversified portfolios of financial assets.
The employer contributions in 2024 are estimated at USD 12m for the UBS US plans and at USD 10m for the Credit 
Suisse US plans.
German pension plans
There are two major unfunded UBS defined benefit plans in Germany. The normal retirement age is 65 and benefits are 
paid directly by UBS. In the larger of the two plans each participant accrues a percentage of salary in a retirement savings 
account. The accumulated account balance of the participant is credited on an annual basis with guaranteed interest at 
a rate of 5%. The plan has been closed to new entrants, and all participants younger than the age of 55 as of June 2021 
no longer accrue benefits. In the other plan, amounts are accrued annually based on employee elections related to 
variable compensation. For this plan, the accumulated account balance is credited on an annual basis with a guaranteed 
interest rate of 6% for amounts accrued before 2010, of 4% for amounts accrued from 2010 to 2017, and of 0.9% for 
amounts accrued after 2017. Both plans are subject to German pension law, whereby the responsibility to pay pension 
benefits when they are due resides entirely with UBS. A portion of the pension payments is directly increased in line with 
price inflation.
In June 2021, UBS implemented a new funded pension plan with interest credited to participants equal to actual 
investment returns with a guaranteed minimum of 0%. The plan was implemented retrospectively for new hires since 
June 2018 and for all eligible active participants younger than 55 from July 2021. Each participant accrues a percentage 
of salary in a retirement savings account.
The employer contributions in 2024 are estimated at USD 14m for the UBS German plans. 
There are no major Credit Suisse defined benefit plans in Germany.

Actuarial assumptions
The actuarial assumptions used for the defined benefit plans are based on the economic conditions prevailing in the 
jurisdiction in which they are offered. Changes in the defined benefit obligation are most sensitive to changes in the 
discount rate. The discount rate is based on the yield of high-quality corporate bonds quoted in an active market in the 
currency of the respective plan. A decrease in the discount curve increases the DBO. UBS regularly reviews the actuarial 
assumptions used in calculating the DBO to determine their continuing relevance.

Sensitivity analysis of significant actuarial assumptions
The table below presents a sensitivity analysis for each significant actuarial assumption, showing how the DBO would 
have been affected by changes in the relevant actuarial assumption that were reasonably possible at the balance sheet 
date. Unforeseen circumstances may arise, which could result in variations that are outside the range of alternatives 
deemed reasonably possible. Caution should be used in extrapolating the sensitivities below on the DBO, as the 
sensitivities may not be linear.

b) Defined contribution plans
UBS sponsors several defined contribution plans, with the most significant plans in the US and the UK. UBS’s obligation 
is limited to its contributions made in accordance with each plan, which may include direct contributions and matching 
contributions. Employer contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized as an expense and were USD 386m 
for the UBS plans and USD 128m for the Credit Suisse plans in 2023 (2022: USD 357m for the UBS plans).
› Refer to Note 7 for more information
c) Related-party disclosure
UBS is the principal provider of banking services for the pension funds of UBS and Credit Suisse in Switzerland. In this 
capacity, UBS is engaged to execute most of the pension funds’ banking activities. These activities can include, but are 
not limited to, trading, securities lending and borrowing and derivative transactions. The non-Swiss pension funds do not 
have a similar banking relationship with UBS. During 2023, UBS received USD 35m in fees for banking services from the 
major UBS plans and USD 11m from the major Credit Suisse plans (2022: USD 36m from the major UBS plans). As of 
31 December 2023, the major UBS plans held USD 417m in UBS shares and major Credit Suisse plans held USD 26m 
(31 December 2022: Major UBS plans held USD 265m).

Note 28 Employee benefits: variable compensation 
a) Plans offered
The Group has several share-based and other deferred compensation plans that align the interests of Group Executive 
Board (GEB) members and other employees with the interests of investors. 
Share-based awards are granted in the form of notional shares and, where permitted, carry a dividend equivalent that may be 
paid in notional shares or cash. Awards are settled by delivering UBS shares at vesting, except in jurisdictions where this is not 
permitted for legal or tax reasons. 
Deferred compensation awards are generally forfeitable upon, among other circumstances, voluntary termination of 
employment with UBS. These compensation plans are also designed to meet regulatory requirements and include special 
provisions for regulated employees. 
The most significant deferred compensation plans are described below.
› Refer to Note 1a item 4 for a description of the accounting policy related to share-based and other deferred compensation plans
Mandatory deferred compensation plans
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is a mandatory deferred share-based compensation plan for senior leaders of the 
Group (i.e., GEB members and selected senior management).
The number of notional shares delivered at vesting depends on two equally weighted performance metrics over a threeyear performance period: return on common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital and relative total shareholder return, which 
compares the total shareholder return (TSR) of UBS with the TSR of an index consisting of listed Global Systemically 
Important Banks as determined by the Financial Stability Board (excluding UBS). The final number of shares vest over 
three years following the performance period for GEB members, and cliff-vest in the year following the performance 
period for selected senior management.
Equity Ownership Plan / Fund Ownership Plan
The Equity Ownership Plan (EOP) is the deferred share-based compensation plan for employees outside of the GEB that 
are subject to deferral requirements. EOP awards generally vest over three years. 
Certain Asset Management employees receive some or all of their EOP in the form of notional funds (Fund Ownership 
Plan or FOP, previously named AM EOP). This plan is generally delivered in cash and vests over three years. The amount 
delivered depends on the value of the underlying investment funds at the time of vesting. 
Deferred Contingent Capital Plan
The Deferred Contingent Capital Plan (DCCP) is a deferred compensation plan for all employees who are subject to 
deferral requirements. Such employees are awarded notional additional tier 1 (AT1) capital instruments, which, at the 
discretion of UBS, can be settled in cash or a perpetual, marketable AT1 capital instrument. DCCP awards generally bear 
notional interest paid annually (except for certain regulated employees) and vest in full after five years. Awards are 
forfeited if a viability event occurs (i.e., if FINMA notifies the firm that the DCCP awards must be written down to mitigate 
the risk of insolvency, bankruptcy or failure of UBS) or if the firm receives a commitment of extraordinary support from 
the public sector that is necessary to prevent such an event. DCCP awards are also written down if the Group’s CET1 
capital ratio falls below a defined threshold. In addition, GEB members forfeit 20% of DCCP awards for each loss-making 
year during the vesting period.

Note 28 Employee benefits: variable compensation (continued)
Deferred compensation plans awarded to employees of Credit Suisse
Awards granted in connection with the acquisition
Retention awards were offered to selected employees of the Credit Suisse Group prior to the acquisition date to support 
the completion of the transaction and the early phase of integration. These awards were contingent on the completion 
of the acquisition and are delivered 50% in cash (in general vesting 60 days from the completion of the acquisition) and 
50% in shares (in general vesting on the first anniversary of the completion of the acquisition). Vesting periods are longer 
for certain regulated employees. 
Existing compensation plans offered to employees of Credit Suisse before the acquisition
Credit Suisse offered a range of compensation plans to its employees. Generally, outstanding deferred awards continue 
to vest according to their original terms. Awards referenced to shares of Credit Suisse Group were converted into units 
over UBS Group shares according to the exchange ratio applied to the merger transaction (1 share in UBS for 22.48 
shares in Credit Suisse). 
Unvested awards that contributed to compensation expenses in 2023 and continue to be expensed over the future service 
period include upfront cash awards, share awards and other deferred awards settled in cash. These awards were granted 
for the main purpose of employee retention. 
Upfront cash awards are subject to repayment (clawback) by the employee in the event of voluntary resignation, 
termination for cause or other specified events within three years from the grant date. The expense is recognized over 
the three-year service period according to the clawback provisions.
Share awards that were granted as part of the annual performance incentive typically vest over three years with one third 
of the award vesting on each of the three anniversaries of the grant date.
Financial advisor variable compensation
In line with market practice for US wealth management businesses, the compensation for US financial advisors in Global 
Wealth Management consists of cash compensation and deferred compensation awards, determined using a formulaic 
approach based on production. 
Cash compensation reflects a percentage of the compensable production that each financial advisor generates. 
Compensable production is generally based on transaction revenue and investment advisory fees and may reflect further 
adjustments. The percentage rate generally varies based on the level of the production and firm tenure.
Financial advisors may also be granted annual deferred compensation. These amounts generally vest over a six-year 
period. The annual deferred compensation amount reflects the overall percentage rate and production. 
Cash compensation and deferred compensation awards may be reduced for, among other things, errors, negligence or 
carelessness, or failure to comply with the firm’s rules, standards, practices and / or policies, and / or applicable laws and 
regulations. 
Financial advisors may also participate in additional programs to support promoting and developing their business or 
supporting the transition of client relationships where appropriate. Financial advisor compensation also includes expenses 
related to compensation commitments with financial advisors entered into at the time of recruitment that are subject to 
vesting requirements.
Share delivery obligations
Share delivery obligations related to employee share-based compensation awards were 196m shares as of 31 December 
2023 (31 December 2022: 178m shares). Share delivery obligations are calculated on the basis of undistributed notional 
share awards, taking applicable performance conditions into account.
As of 31 December 2023, UBS held 131m treasury shares (31 December 2022: 119m) that were available to satisfy share 
delivery obligations.

b) Effect on the income statement
Effect on the income statement for the financial year and future periods
The table below provides information about compensation expenses related to total variable compensation that were 
recognized in the financial year ended 31 December 2023, as well as expenses that were deferred and will be recognized 
in the income statement for 2024 and later. Deferred expenses related to compensation plans granted to employees of 
Credit Suisse in 2023 and earlier years are presented under Variable compensation – other. The expense recognized in 
2023 associated with these awards was USD 335m for retention awards granted in connection with the acquisition and 
USD 412m for outstanding deferred compensation plans that existed on the date of acquisition. 
The majority of expenses deferred to 2024 and later that are related to the 2023 performance year pertain to awards 
granted in February 2024. The total unamortized compensation expense for unvested share-based awards granted up to 
31 December 2023 will be recognized in future periods over a weighted average period of 2.2 years.

d) Valuation
UBS share awards
UBS measures compensation expense based on the average market price of UBS shares on the grant date as quoted on 
the SIX Swiss Exchange, taking into consideration post-vesting sale and hedge restrictions, non-vesting conditions and 
market conditions, where applicable. The fair value of the share awards subject to post-vesting sale and hedge restrictions 
is discounted on the basis of the duration of the post-vesting restriction and is referenced to the cost of purchasing an 
at-the-money European put option for the term of the transfer restriction. The grant date fair value of notional shares 
without dividend entitlements also includes a deduction for the present value of future expected dividends to be paid 
between the grant date and distribution.
Note 29 Interests in subsidiaries and other entities
a) Interests in subsidiaries
UBS defines its significant subsidiaries as those entities that, either individually or in aggregate, contribute significantly to 
the Group’s financial position or results of operations, based on a number of criteria, including the subsidiaries’ equity

Consolidated structured entities
Consolidated structured entities (SEs) include certain investment funds, securitization vehicles and client investment 
vehicles. UBS has no individually significant subsidiaries that are SEs.
In 2023 and 2022, the Group did not enter into any contractual obligation that could require the Group to provide 
financial support to consolidated SEs. In addition, the Group did not provide support, financial or otherwise, to a 
consolidated SE when the Group was not contractually obligated to do so, nor does the Group currently have any 
intention to do so in the future. Furthermore, the Group did not provide support, financial or otherwise, to a previously 
unconsolidated SE that resulted in the Group controlling the SE during the reporting period.

Note 29 Interests in subsidiaries and other entities (continued)
b) Interests in associates and joint ventures
As of 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, no associate or joint venture was individually material to the Group. 
Also, there were no significant restrictions on the ability of associates or joint ventures to transfer funds to UBS Group AG 
or its subsidiaries as cash dividends or to repay loans or advances made. There were no quoted market prices for any 
associates or joint ventures of the Group.

negative USD 17m from associates (for 2022, consists of negative USD 73m from associates).
c) Unconsolidated structured entities
UBS is considered to sponsor another entity if, in addition to ongoing involvement with that entity, it had a key role in 
establishing that entity or in bringing together relevant counterparties for a transaction facilitated by that entity. During 
2023, the Group sponsored the creation of various SEs and interacted with a number of non-sponsored SEs, including 
securitization vehicles, client vehicles and certain investment funds, that UBS did not consolidate as of 31 December 2023 
because it did not control them.
Interests in unconsolidated structured entities
The table below presents the Group’s interests in and maximum exposure to loss from unconsolidated SEs, as well as the 
total assets held by the SEs in which UBS had an interest as of year-end, except for investment funds sponsored by third 
parties, for which the carrying amount of UBS’s interest as of year-end has been disclosed.
As a consequence of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group and the resulting increase in interests in structured 
entities, interests in client vehicles sponsored by UBS are presented separately to other vehicles sponsored by third parties, 
to clearly distinguish the different types of entities that UBS is involved with. Further, bonds issued by US governmentsponsored entities included within Group Treasury’s HQLA portfolio have been excluded given UBS does not absorb 
significant risk and third-party funding vehicles of large multi-nationals have been excluded as they are no longer 
considered structured entities. Prior periods have been restated to reflect these changes. 
The increase in interests held in structured entities primarily relates to financial assets at fair value in the Non-core and 
Legacy business division.
Sponsored unconsolidated structured entities in which UBS did not have an interest at year-end
During 2023 and 2022, the Group did not earn material income from sponsored unconsolidated SEs in which UBS did 
not have an interest at year-end. 
During 2023 and 2022, UBS and third parties did not transfer any assets into sponsored securitization vehicles created in 
those years. UBS and third parties transferred assets, alongside deposits and debt issuances (which are assets from the 
perspective of the vehicle), of USD 0.5bn and USD 0.5bn, respectively, into sponsored client vehicles created in 2023 
(2022: USD 1bn and USD 3bn, respectively). For sponsored investment funds, transfers arose during the period as 
investors invested and redeemed positions, thereby changing the overall size of the funds, which, when combined with 
market movements, resulted in a total closing net asset value of USD 137bn (31 December 2022: USD 38bn).

1 Includes loans with a high LTV and credit-impaired loans to pre-securitization warehouse structured entities managed by third parties, as well as securities issued by securitization structured entities sponsored by 
both UBS and third parties. 2 Client vehicles sponsored by UBS are structured entities that do not qualify as a securitization in line with regulatory requirements and are not considered an investment fund. Effective 
from 31 December 2023, bonds issued by US government-sponsored entities included in Group Treasury‘s HQLA and interests in third-party funding vehicles of large multi-nationals have been excluded, with prior 
periods restated. The restatement resulted in a decrease in interests in securitization vehicles of USD 852m and a decrease in interests in client vehicles of USD 5,057m as of 31 December 2022. There was a 
corresponding decrease in assets held by securitization vehicles in which UBS has an interest of USD 11bn and a decrease in assets held by client vehicles in which UBS has an interest of USD 105bn as of 31 December 
2022. 3 Other vehicles sponsored by third parties are structured entities that do not qualify as a securitization in line with regulatory requirements and are not considered an investment fund. Interests in other 
vehicles sponsored by third parties included loans with a high LTV and credit-impaired loans provided to third-party structured entities. 4 For the purpose of this disclosure, maximum exposure to loss amounts do 
not consider the risk-reducing effects of collateral or other credit enhancements. 5 Represents the principal amount outstanding. 6 Represents the market value of total assets. 7 Represents the net asset value 
of the investment funds sponsored by UBS and the carrying amount of UBS’s interests in the investment funds not sponsored by UBS. 8 Represents the carrying amount of UBS's interest in other vehicles sponsored 
by third parties.
The Group retains or purchases interests in unconsolidated SEs in the form of direct investments, financing, guarantees, 
letters of credit and derivatives, as well as through management contracts. The Group’s maximum exposure to loss is 
generally equal to the carrying amount of the Group’s interest in the given SE, with this subject to change over time with 
market movements. Guarantees, letters of credit and credit derivatives are an exception, with the given contract’s 
notional amount, adjusted for losses already incurred, representing the maximum loss that the Group is exposed to.
The maximum exposure to loss disclosed in the table above does not reflect the Group’s risk management activities, 
including effects from financial instruments that may be used to economically hedge risks inherent in the given 
unconsolidated SE or risk-reducing effects of collateral or other credit enhancements.
In 2023 and 2022, the Group did not provide support, financial or otherwise, to any unconsolidated SE when not 
contractually obligated to do so, nor does the Group currently have any intention to do so in the future.
In 2023 and 2022, income and expenses from interests in unconsolidated SEs primarily resulted from mark-to-market 
movements recognized in Other net income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
which were generally hedged with other financial instruments, as well as fee and commission income received from UBSsponsored funds.
Interests in securitization vehicles
As of 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the Group held interests, both retained and acquired, in various 
securitization vehicles that relate to financing, underwriting, secondary market and derivative trading activities. In addition 
to the interests disclosed in the table above, the Group manages the assets of certain securitization vehicles and receives 
fees based, in whole or in part, on the asset value of the vehicles. Interest in such vehicles, acquired as part of the 
acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, is not represented by the on-balance sheet fee receivable but rather by the future 
exposure to variable fees. The total assets of such vehicles were USD 26bn as of 31 December 2023, and have been 
excluded from the table above.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 398
Note 29 Interests in subsidiaries and other entities (continued)
The numbers outlined in the table above may differ from the securitization positions presented in the 31 December 2023 
Pillar 3 Report, available under “Pillar 3 disclosures” at ubs.com/investors, for the following reasons: (i) exclusion of synthetic 
securitizations transacted with entities that are not SEs and transactions in which the Group did not have an interest because 
it did not absorb any risk; (ii) a different measurement basis in certain cases (e.g., IFRS Accounting Standards carrying amount 
within the table above compared with net exposure amount at default for Pillar 3 disclosures); and (iii) different classification 
of vehicles viewed as sponsored by the Group versus sponsored by third parties.
› Refer to the 31 December 2023 Pillar 3 Report, available under “Pillar 3 disclosures” at ubs.com/investors, for more information
Interests in client vehicles sponsored by UBS
UBS-sponsored client vehicles are established predominantly for clients to gain exposure to specific assets or risk 
exposures. Such vehicles may enter into derivative agreements, with UBS or a third party, to align the cash flows of the 
entity with the investor’s intended investment objective, or to introduce other desired risk exposures. 
As of 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, the Group retained interests in client vehicles sponsored by UBS that 
relate to financing, secondary market and derivative trading activities, and to hedge structured product offerings. 
Interests in investment funds
Investment funds have a collective investment objective, and are either passively managed, so that any decision-making 
does not have a substantive effect on variability, or are actively managed and investors or their governing bodies do not 
have substantive voting or similar rights.
The Group holds interests in a number of investment funds, primarily resulting from seed investments or in order to 
hedge structured product offerings. In addition to the interests disclosed in the table above, the Group manages the 
assets of various pooled investment funds and receives fees based, in whole or in part, on the net asset value of the fund 
and / or the performance of the fund. The specific fee structure is determined based on various market factors and 
considers the fund’s nature and the jurisdiction of incorporation, as well as fee schedules negotiated with clients. These 
fee contracts represent an interest in the fund, as they align the Group’s exposure with investors, providing a variable 
return based on the performance of the entity. Depending on the structure of the fund, these fees may be collected 
directly from the fund’s assets and / or from the investors. Any amounts due are collected on a regular basis and are 
generally backed by the fund’s assets. Therefore, interest in such funds is not represented by the on-balance sheet fee 
receivable but rather by the future exposure to variable fees. The total assets of such funds were USD 511bn and 
USD 292bn as of 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, respectively, and have been excluded from the table above. 
The Group did not have any material exposure to loss from these interests as of 31 December 2023 or as of 31 December 
2022. 
Interests in other vehicles sponsored by third parties
Interests in other vehicles sponsored by third parties include loans with a high LTV and credit-impaired loans provided to 
third-party structured entities acquired as part of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group.

Related parties of the Group are: 
– associates (entities that are under the significant influence of the Group); 
– joint ventures (entities in which UBS shares control with another party); 
– post-employment benefit plans for the benefit of UBS employees; 
– key management personnel and close family members of key management personnel; and 
– entities over which key management personnel or their close family members have solely or jointly a direct or indirect

the activities of the Group, directly or indirectly. The Group considers the members of the Board of Directors (the BoD) 
and the Group Executive Board (the GEB) to constitute key management personnel.
a) Remuneration of key management personnel
The Vice Chairman of the BoD has a specific management employment contract and receives pension benefits upon 
retirement. Total remuneration of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the BoD and all GEB members is included in 
the table below.

is based on the share price on grant date taking into account performance conditions. Refer to Note 28 for more information. For GEB members, share-based compensation for 2023, 2022 and 2021 was entirely 
composed of LTIP awards. For the Chairman of the BoD the share-based compensation for 2023, 2022 and 2021 was entirely composed of UBS shares. 4 Swiss franc amounts disclosed represent the respective US 
dollar amounts translated at the applicable performance award currency exchange rates (2023: USD / CHF 0.91; 2022: USD / CHF 0.96; 2021: USD / CHF 0.92).
The independent members of the BoD, including the Chairman, do not have employment or service contracts with UBS, 
and thus are not entitled to benefits upon termination of their service on the BoD. Payments to these individuals for their 
services as independent members of the BoD amounted to USD 11.7m (CHF 10.6m) in 2023, USD 11.1m (CHF 10.7m) 
in 2022 and USD 7.5m (CHF 6.9m) in 2021.

Note 32 Invested assets and net new money 
The following disclosures provide a breakdown of UBS’s invested assets and a presentation of their development, 
including net new money, as required by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).
Invested assets
Invested assets consist of all client assets managed by or deposited with UBS for investment purposes. Invested assets 
include managed fund assets, managed institutional assets, discretionary and advisory wealth management portfolios, 
fiduciary deposits, time deposits, savings accounts, and wealth management securities or brokerage accounts. All assets 
held for purely transactional purposes and custody-only assets, including corporate client assets held for cash 
management and transactional purposes, are excluded from invested assets, as the Group only administers the assets 
and does not offer advice on how they should be invested. Also excluded are non-bankable assets (e.g., art collections) 
and deposits from third-party banks for funding or trading purposes.
Discretionary assets are defined as client assets that UBS decides how to invest. Other invested assets are those where 
the client ultimately decides how the assets are invested. When a single product is created in one business division and 
sold in another, it is counted in both the business division managing the investment and the one distributing it. This 
results in double counting within UBS’s total invested assets and net new money, as both business divisions are 
independently providing a service to their respective clients, and both add value and generate revenue.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 401
Note 32 Invested assets and net new money (continued)
Net new money
Net new money in a reporting period is the amount of invested assets entrusted to UBS by new and existing clients, less 
those withdrawn by existing clients and clients who terminated relationships with UBS.
Net new money is calculated using the direct method, under which inflows and outflows to / from invested assets are 
determined at the client level, based on transactions. Interest and dividend income from invested assets are not counted as 
net new money inflows. Market and currency movements, as well as fees, commissions and interest on loans charged, are 
excluded from net new money, as are effects resulting from any acquisition or divestment of a UBS subsidiary or business. 
Reclassifications between invested assets and custody-only assets as a result of a change in service level delivered are 
generally treated as net new money flows. However, where the change in service level directly results from an externally 
imposed regulation or a strategic decision by UBS to exit a market or specific service offering, the one-time net effect is 
reported as Other effects.
The Investment Bank does not track invested assets and net new money. However, when a client is transferred from the 
Investment Bank to another business division, this may produce net new money even though the client’s assets were 
already with UBS. 
In 2023 UBS has changed its accounting policy for net new money and invested assets to include its share of net new 
money and invested assets from associates, to better reflect the business strategy and aligned with the equity method 
accounting applied to these entities. Comparative figures in the tables below have been restated to reflect this change, 
resulting in an increase to invested assets as of 31 December 2022 of USD 24bn and an increase to net new money for 
2022 of USD 8bn, all relating to Asset Management.

1 Monthly income statement items of operations with a functional currency other than the US dollar are translated into US dollars using month-end rates. Disclosed average rates for a year represent an average of 
twelve month-end rates, weighted according to the income and expense volumes of all operations of the Group with the same functional currency for each month. Accordingly, the weighted average rates for the full 
year 2023 consider income and expenses from Credit Suisse’s operations generated since UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group. Weighted average rates for individual business divisions may deviate from the 
weighted average rates for the Group.

Note 34 Events after the reporting period 
Adjustment made within the IFRS 3 measurement period after publication of the fourth quarter 2023 report
The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group in the second quarter of 2023 resulted in provisional negative goodwill of 
USD 28.9bn. Following the publication of the unaudited fourth quarter 2023 report on 6 February 2024, UBS has refined 
its acquisition-date fair value estimates in accordance with the 12-month measurement period requirements provided by 
IFRS 3, Business Combinations. This has resulted in an adjustment of USD 1.2bn, decreasing the negative goodwill to 
USD 27.7bn. As a result, 2023 operating profit before tax and 2023 net profit attributable to shareholders decreased by 
USD 1.2bn, basic earnings per share decreased by USD 0.38 to USD 8.83 and diluted earnings per share decreased by 
USD 0.36 to USD 8.45. 
› Refer to Note 2 for more information
Non-adjusting post balance sheet events
On 22 March 2024, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG repaid loans drawn under the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) 
facility, reducing the amount of loans outstanding under the ELA from CHF 38bn to CHF 19bn as of that date.
In March 2024, Credit Suisse has entered into agreements with entities and funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global 
Management (collectively, Apollo) and Atlas SP Partners (Atlas) to conclude the investment management agreement 
under which Atlas has managed Credit Suisse’s retained portfolio of assets of its former securitized products group 
(SPG). Following this agreement, the assets previously managed by Atlas will be managed in Non-core and Legacy. The 
parties have also agreed to conclude the transition services agreement under which Credit Suisse has provided services 
to Atlas. In addition, Credit Suisse AG has entered into an agreement to transfer to Apollo approximately USD 8bn of 
senior secured asset-based financing. As part of the loan transfer, Credit Suisse AG will extend a one-year USD 750m 
swingline facility to the borrowers under the transferred financing facilities. UBS Group expects to recognize a net gain 
in the first quarter of 2024 of around USD 0.3bn from the conclusion of the investment management agreement and 
assignment of the loan facilities.
Note 35 Main differences between IFRS Accounting Standards and Swiss GAAP 
The consolidated financial statements of UBS Group AG are prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards. 
The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) requires financial groups presenting financial statements under 
IFRS Accounting Standards to provide a narrative explanation of the main differences between IFRS Accounting Standards 
and Swiss generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) (the FINMA Accounting Ordinance, FINMA Circular 2020/1 
“Accounting – banks” and the Banking Ordinance (the BO)). Included in this Note are the significant differences in the 
recognition and measurement between IFRS Accounting Standards and the provisions of the BO and the guidelines of 
FINMA governing true and fair view financial statement reporting pursuant to Art. 25 to Art. 42 of the BO.
1. Consolidation
Under IFRS Accounting Standards, all entities that are controlled by the holding entity are consolidated. Under Swiss 
GAAP, controlled entities deemed immaterial to a group or those held only temporarily are exempt from consolidation, 
but instead are recorded as participations accounted for under the equity method of accounting or as financial 
investments measured at the lower of cost or market value.
2. Classification and measurement of financial assets
Under IFRS Accounting Standards, debt instruments are measured at amortized cost, fair value through other 
comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), depending on the nature of the business 
model within which the particular asset is held and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the asset. Equity 
instruments are accounted for at FVTPL by UBS. Under Swiss GAAP, trading assets and derivatives are measured at FVTPL, 
in line with IFRS Accounting Standards. However, non-trading debt instruments are generally measured at amortized 
cost, even when the assets are managed on a fair value basis. In addition, the measurement of financial assets in the 
form of securities depends on the nature of the asset: debt instruments not held to maturity, i.e., instruments available 
for sale, and equity instruments with no permanent holding intent, are classified as Financial investments and measured 
at the lower of (amortized) cost or market value. Market value adjustments up to the original cost amount and realized 
gains or losses upon disposal of the investment are recorded in the income statement as Other income from ordinary 
activities. Equity instruments with a permanent holding intent are classified as participations in Non-consolidated 
investments in subsidiaries and other participations and are measured at cost less impairment. Impairment losses are 
recorded in the income statement as Impairment of investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participations.
Reversals of impairments up to the original cost amount and realized gains or losses upon disposal of the investment are 
recorded as Extraordinary income / Extraordinary expenses.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 403
Note 35 Main differences between IFRS Accounting Standards and Swiss GAAP (continued)
3. Fair value option applied to financial liabilities
Under IFRS Accounting Standards, UBS applies the fair value option to certain financial liabilities not held for trading. 
Instruments for which the fair value option is applied are accounted for at FVTPL. The amount of change in the fair value 
attributable to changes in UBS’s own credit is presented in Other comprehensive income directly within Retained earnings. 
The fair value option is applied primarily to issued structured debt instruments, certain non-structured debt instruments, 
certain payables under repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities lending agreements, amounts due under 
unit-linked investment contracts, and brokerage payables.
Under Swiss GAAP, the fair value option can only be applied to structured debt instruments consisting of a debt host 
contract and one or more embedded derivatives that do not relate to own equity. Furthermore, unrealized changes in 
fair value attributable to changes in UBS’s own credit are not recognized, whereas realized own credit is recognized in
Net trading income.
4. Allowances and provisions for credit losses
Swiss GAAP permit use of IFRS Accounting Standards for accounting for allowances and provisions for credit losses based 
on an expected credit loss (ECL) model. UBS has chosen to apply the IFRS 9 ECL approach to those exposures that are in 
the ECL scope of both frameworks, IFRS Accounting Standards and Swiss GAAP.
For the small residual exposures within the scope of Swiss GAAP ECL requirements, which are not subject to ECL under 
IFRS Accounting Standards due to classification differences, UBS applies alternative approaches. 
– For exposures for which Pillar 1 internal ratings-based models are applied to measure credit risk, ECL is determined by 
the regulatory expected loss (EL), with an add-on for scaling up to the residual maturity of exposures maturing beyond 
the next 12 months, as appropriate. For detailed information on regulatory EL, refer to the “Risk management and 
control” section of this report. 
– For exposures for which the Pillar 1 standardized approach is used to measure credit risk, ECL is determined using a 
portfolio approach that derives a conservative probability of default (PD) and a conservative loss given default (LGD) 
for the entire portfolio. 
5. Hedge accounting
Under IFRS Accounting Standards, when cash flow hedge accounting is applied, the fair value gain or loss on the effective 
portion of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is recognized initially in equity and reclassified to the income 
statement when certain conditions are met. When fair value hedge accounting is applied, the fair value change of the 
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is reflected in the measurement of the hedged item and is recognized in the 
income statement along with the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative. Under Swiss GAAP, the effective 
portion of the fair value change of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow or as a fair value hedge is deferred 
on the balance sheet as Other assets or Other liabilities. The carrying amount of the hedged item designated in fair value 
hedges is not adjusted for fair value changes attributable to the hedged risk.
6. Business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets
Under IFRS Accounting Standards, business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, as prescribed 
by IFRS 3, Business Combinations. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives acquired in a business 
combination are not amortized but tested annually for impairment. Negative goodwill is recognized in the income 
statement.
Under Swiss GAAP, assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are generally recorded at market value. 
Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are amortized over a period not exceeding five years, unless a 
longer useful life, which may not exceed 10 years, can be justified. In addition, these assets are tested annually for 
impairment. If acquisition-date amounts of the net assets acquired exceed the market value of the consideration 
transferred, incremental provisions are recognized for expected cash outflows related to taking over control of the 
business, e.g. for expected restructuring. Any remaining negative goodwill is recognized in the income statement.
7. Post-employment benefit plans
Swiss GAAP permit the use of IFRS Accounting Standards or Swiss accounting standards for post-employment benefit 
plans, with the election made on a plan-by-plan basis.
Annual Report 2023 | Consolidated financial statements | UBS Group AG consolidated financial statements 404
Note 35 Main differences between IFRS Accounting Standards and Swiss GAAP (continued)
UBS has elected to apply IAS 19 for the non-Swiss defined benefit plans in the UBS AG standalone financial statements 
and Swiss GAAP (FER 16) for the Swiss pension plan in the UBS AG and the UBS Switzerland AG standalone financial 
statements. The requirements of Swiss GAAP are better aligned with the specific nature of Swiss pension plans, which 
are hybrid in that they combine elements of defined contribution and defined benefit plans, but are treated as defined 
benefit plans under IFRS Accounting Standards. Key differences between Swiss GAAP and IFRS Accounting Standards 
include the treatment of dynamic elements, such as future salary increases and future interest credits on retirement 
savings, which are not considered under the static method used in accordance with Swiss GAAP. Also, the discount rate 
used to determine the defined benefit obligation in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards is based on the yield of 
high-quality corporate bonds of the market in the respective pension plan country. The discount rate used in accordance 
with Swiss GAAP (i.e., the technical interest rate) is determined by the Pension Foundation Board based on the expected 
returns of the Board’s investment strategy.
For defined benefit plans, IFRS Accounting Standards require the full defined benefit obligation net of the plan assets to 
be recorded on the balance sheet subject to the asset ceiling rules, with changes resulting from remeasurements 
recognized directly in equity. However, for non-Swiss defined benefit plans for which IFRS Accounting Standards are 
elected, changes due to remeasurements are recognized in the income statement of UBS AG standalone under Swiss 
GAAP.
Swiss GAAP require employer contributions to the pension fund to be recognized as personnel expenses in the income 
statement. Swiss GAAP also require an assessment of whether, based on the pension fund’s financial statements prepared 
in accordance with Swiss accounting standards (FER 26), an economic benefit to, or obligation of, the employer arises 
from the pension fund that is recognized in the balance sheet when conditions are met. Conditions for recording a 
pension asset or liability would be met if, for example, an employer contribution reserve is available or the employer is 
required to contribute to the reduction of a pension deficit (on an FER 26 basis).
8. Leasing
Under IFRS Accounting Standards, a single lease accounting model applies that requires UBS to record a right-of-use 
(RoU) asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet when UBS is a lessee in a lease arrangement. The 
RoU asset and the lease liability are recognized when UBS acquires control of the physical use of the asset. The lease 
liability is measured based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term, discounted using UBS’s 
unsecured borrowing rate. The RoU asset is recorded at an amount equal to the lease liability but is adjusted for rent 
prepayments, initial direct costs, any costs to refurbish the leased asset and / or lease incentives received. The RoU asset 
is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset.
Under Swiss GAAP, leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards, but not necessarily legal title in the 
underlying assets, are classified as finance leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Whereas finance 
leases are recognized on the balance sheet and measured in line with IFRS Accounting Standards, operating leases are 
not recognized on the balance sheet, with payments recognized as General and administrative expenses on a straightline basis over the lease term, which commences with control of the physical use of the asset. Lease incentives are treated 
as a reduction of rental expense and recognized on a consistent basis over the lease term. 
9. Netting of derivative assets and liabilities
Under IFRS Accounting Standards, derivative assets, derivative liabilities and related cash collateral not settled to market 
are reported on a gross basis unless the restrictive netting requirements under IFRS Accounting Standards are met: 
(i) existence of master netting agreements and related collateral arrangements that are unconditional and legally 
enforceable, in both the normal course of business and the event of default, bankruptcy or insolvency of UBS and its 
counterparties; and (ii) UBS’s intention to either settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously. Under Swiss GAAP, derivative assets, derivative liabilities and related cash collateral not settled to market 
are generally reported on a net basis, provided the master netting and the related collateral agreements are legally 
enforceable in the event of default, bankruptcy or insolvency of UBS’s counterparties.
10. Negative interest
Under IFRS Accounting Standards, negative interest income arising on a financial asset does not meet the definition of 
interest income and, therefore, negative interest on financial assets and negative interest on financial liabilities are 
presented within interest expense and interest income, respectively. Under Swiss GAAP, negative interest on financial 
assets is presented within interest income and negative interest on financial liabilities is presented within interest expense.
11. Extraordinary income and expense
Certain non-recurring and non-operating income and expense items, such as negative goodwill realized gains or losses 
from the disposal of participations, fixed and intangible assets, and reversals of impairments of participations and fixed 
assets, are classified as extraordinary items under Swiss GAAP. This distinction is not available under IFRS Accounting 
Standards. 

Annual Report 2023 | Significant regulated subsidiary and sub-group information 406
UBS Group AG is a holding company and conducts substantially all of its operations through UBS AG, Credit Suisse AG 
and subsidiaries thereof. UBS Group AG, UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG have contributed a significant portion of their 
respective capital to, and provide substantial liquidity to, such subsidiaries. Many of these subsidiaries are subject to 
regulations requiring compliance with minimum capital, liquidity and similar requirements. The table in this section 
summarizes the regulatory capital components and capital ratios of our significant regulated subsidiaries and sub-groups 
determined under the regulatory framework of each subsidiary’s or sub-group’s home jurisdiction.

Supervisory authorities generally have discretion to impose higher requirements or to otherwise limit the activities of 
subsidiaries. Supervisory authorities also may require entities to measure capital and leverage ratios on a stressed basis 
and may limit the ability of an entity to engage in new activities or take capital actions based on the results of those tests.
In June 2023, the Federal Reserve Board released the results of its 2023 Dodd–Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST). UBS’s US 
intermediate holding company, UBS Americas Holding LLC, and Credit Suisse’s intermediate holding, Credit Suisse 
Holdings (USA), Inc., exceeded the minimum capital requirements under the severely adverse scenario. Following the 
completion of the annual DFAST and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), UBS Americas Holding 
LLC was assigned a stress capital buffer (an SCB) of 9.1% (previously 4.8%) under the SCB rule as of 1 October 2023, 
resulting in a total common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital requirement of 13.6%. Credit Suisse Holdings (USA), Inc. was 
assigned an SCB of 7.2% (previously 9.0%), resulting in a total CET1 capital requirement of 11.7%. 
Additional information on the above entities is provided in the 31 December 2023 Pillar 3 report, which is available under

UBS Group AG consolidated supplemental disclosures 
required under SEC regulations
A – Introduction
The following pages contain supplemental UBS Group AG disclosures that are required under US Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) regulations. UBS Group AG’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with IFRS Accounting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (the IASB) and are 
denominated in US dollars.
On 12 June 2023, UBS Group AG acquired Credit Suisse Group AG, succeeding by operation of Swiss law to all assets 
and liabilities of Credit Suisse Group AG, and became the direct or indirect shareholder of all of the former direct and 
indirect subsidiaries of Credit Suisse Group AG. The acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group constitutes a business 
combination under IFRS 3, Business Combinations, and is required to be accounted for by applying the acquisition method 
of accounting. With the acquisition date of 12 June 2023, for convenience the Credit Suisse Group was consolidated 
from 31 May 2023, as the impact of transactions and activities in the period from 31 May 2023 to 12 June 2023 on the 
consolidated financial statements was not material.

as a reduction to interest expense, while in the consolidated income statement negative interest income on liabilities is presented as interest income. Refer to “Note 4 Net interest income and other net income from 
financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss“ in the “Consolidated financial statements” section of this report for more information. 4 Mainly includes derivative financial instruments, equity 
instruments at fair value held for trading and financial liabilities related to unit-linked investment contracts.
The percentage of total average interest-earning assets attributable to foreign activities was 57% for 2023 (2022: 61%; 
2021: 60%). The percentage of total average interest-bearing liabilities attributable to foreign activities was 56% for 
2023 (2022: 60%; 2021: 59%). All assets and liabilities are translated into US dollars at uniform month-end rates. Interest 
income and expense are translated at monthly average rates.
Average rates earned and paid on assets and liabilities can change from period to period, based on the changes in interest 
rates in general, but are also affected by changes in the currency mix included in the assets and liabilities. Tax-exempt 
income is not recorded on a tax-equivalent basis. For all three years presented, tax-exempt income is considered to be 
insignificant, and the effect from such income is therefore negligible.

Analysis of changes in interest income and expense
The tables below provide information, by categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, about the 
changes in interest income and expense due to changes in volume and interest rates for the year ended 31 December 
2023 compared with the year ended 31 December 2022, and for the year ended 31 December 2022 compared with the 
year ended 31 December 2021. The change in average volume represents the change in the current average balance 
compared to the average balance from the prior year with respect to the average rate of the prior year. The change in 
average rate represents the difference between the net change in interest income and expense and the change in average 
volume.

Uninsured deposits
From the combined total of Due to banks and Customer deposits as of 31 December 2023, total estimated uninsured 
deposits were USD 670bn (31 December 2022: USD 362bn; 31 December 2021: USD 392bn). Uninsured deposits are 
deposits that are in excess of local deposit insurance or protection scheme limits in the key locations in which UBS 
operates, calculated based on the respective local regulations, as well as deposits in uninsured accounts. The main deposit 
insurance schemes applicable to UBS deposits are the Swiss depositor protection scheme in Switzerland (which protects 
applicable deposits up to a maximum of CHF 100,000 per client and per bank or securities firm), the Compensation 
Scheme of German Banks in combination with the Deposit Protection Fund of the Association of German Banks in 
Germany (which protects applicable deposits up to a maximum of EUR 5m per client and EUR 50m per business) and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) scheme in the Americas (which protects applicable deposits up to a 
maximum of USD 250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category).
The table below presents the maturity of estimated uninsured time deposits as of 31 December 2023. Where a depositor 
holds multiple accounts that in aggregate are in excess of a deposit insurance or protection limit, the insured amount is 
first allocated to the account with the shortest time to maturity.

Alternative performance measures
Alternative performance measures
An alternative performance measure (an APM) is a financial measure of historical or future financial performance, financial 
position or cash flows other than a financial measure defined or specified in the applicable recognized accounting 
standards or in other applicable regulations. A number of APMs are reported in the discussion of the financial and 
operating performance of the external reports (annual, quarterly and other reports). APMs are used to provide a more 
complete picture of operating performance and to reflect management’s view of the fundamental drivers of the business 
results. A definition of each APM, the method used to calculate it and the information content are presented in 
alphabetical order in the table below. These APMs may qualify as non-GAAP measures as defined by US Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.

Annual Report 2023 | Appendix 425
Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements | This report contains statements that constitute “forward-looking statements,” including but 
not limited to management’s outlook for UBS’s financial performance, statements relating to the anticipated effect of transactions and strategic initiatives on 
UBS’s business and future development and goals or intentions to achieve climate, sustainability and other social objectives. While these forward-looking 
statements represent UBS’s judgments, expectations and objectives concerning the matters described, a number of risks, uncertainties and other important 
factors could cause actual developments and results to differ materially from UBS’s expectations. In particular, terrorist activity and conflicts in the Middle East, 
as well as the continuing Russia–Ukraine war, may have significant impacts on global markets, exacerbate global inflationary pressures, and slow global growth. 
In addition, the ongoing conflicts may continue to cause significant population displacement, and lead to shortages of vital commodities, including energy 
shortages and food insecurity outside the areas immediately involved in armed conflict. Governmental responses to the armed conflicts, including, with respect 
to the Russia–Ukraine war, coordinated successive sets of sanctions on Russia and Belarus, and Russian and Belarusian entities and nationals, and the uncertainty 
as to whether the ongoing conflicts will widen and intensify, may continue to have significant adverse effects on the market and macroeconomic conditions, 
including in ways that cannot be anticipated. UBS’s acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group has materially changed our outlook and strategic direction and 
introduced new operational challenges. The integration of the Credit Suisse entities into the UBS structure is expected to take between three and five years and 
presents significant risks, including the risks that UBS Group AG may be unable to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits contemplated by the transaction. 
This creates significantly greater uncertainty about forward-looking statements. Other factors that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our plans, 
outlook and other objectives also include, but are not limited to: (i) the degree to which UBS is successful in the execution of its strategic plans, including its cost 
reduction and efficiency initiatives and its ability to manage its levels of risk-weighted assets (RWA) and leverage ratio denominator (LRD), liquidity coverage ratio 
and other financial resources, including changes in RWA assets and liabilities arising from higher market volatility and the size of the combined Group; (ii) the 
degree to which UBS is successful in implementing changes to its businesses to meet changing market, regulatory and other conditions, including as a result of 
the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; (iii) increased inflation and interest rate volatility in major markets; (iv) developments in the macroeconomic climate 
and in the markets in which UBS operates or to which it is exposed, including movements in securities prices or liquidity, credit spreads, currency exchange rates, 
deterioration or slow recovery in residential and commercial real estate markets, the effects of economic conditions, including increasing inflationary pressures, 
market developments, increasing geopolitical tensions, and changes to national trade policies on the financial position or creditworthiness of UBS’s clients and 
counterparties, as well as on client sentiment and levels of activity; (v) changes in the availability of capital and funding, including any adverse changes in UBS’s 
credit spreads and credit ratings of UBS, Credit Suisse, sovereign issuers, structured credit products or credit-related exposures, as well as availability and cost of 
funding to meet requirements for debt eligible for total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC), in particular in light of the acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group; 
(vi) changes in central bank policies or the implementation of financial legislation and regulation in Switzerland, the US, the UK, the EU and other financial centers 
that have imposed, or resulted in, or may do so in the future, more stringent or entity-specific capital, TLAC, leverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity and 
funding requirements, heightened operational resilience requirements, incremental tax requirements, additional levies, limitations on permitted activities, 
constraints on remuneration, constraints on transfers of capital and liquidity and sharing of operational costs across the Group or other measures, and the effect 
these will or would have on UBS’s business activities; (vii) UBS’s ability to successfully implement resolvability and related regulatory requirements and the potential 
need to make further changes to the legal structure or booking model of UBS in response to legal and regulatory requirements and any additional requirements 
due to its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, or other developments; (viii) UBS’s ability to maintain and improve its systems and controls for complying with 
sanctions in a timely manner and for the detection and prevention of money laundering to meet evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, in particular 
in current geopolitical turmoil; (ix) the uncertainty arising from domestic stresses in certain major economies; (x) changes in UBS’s competitive position, including 
whether differences in regulatory capital and other requirements among the major financial centers adversely affect UBS’s ability to compete in certain lines of 
business; (xi) changes in the standards of conduct applicable to our businesses that may result from new regulations or new enforcement of existing standards, 
including measures to impose new and enhanced duties when interacting with customers and in the execution and handling of customer transactions; (xii) the 
liability to which UBS may be exposed, or possible constraints or sanctions that regulatory authorities might impose on UBS, due to litigation, contractual claims 
and regulatory investigations, including the potential for disqualification from certain businesses, potentially large fines or monetary penalties, or the loss of 
licenses or privileges as a result of regulatory or other governmental sanctions, as well as the effect that litigation, regulatory and similar matters have on the 
operational risk component of our RWA, including as a result of its acquisition of the Credit Suisse Group, as well as the amount of capital available for return 
to shareholders; (xiii) the effects on UBS’s business, in particular cross-border banking, of sanctions, tax or regulatory developments and of possible changes in 
UBS’s policies and practices; (xiv) UBS’s ability to retain and attract the employees necessary to generate revenues and to manage, support and control its 
businesses, which may be affected by competitive factors; (xv) changes in accounting or tax standards or policies, and determinations or interpretations affecting 
the recognition of gain or loss, the valuation of goodwill, the recognition of deferred tax assets and other matters; (xvi) UBS’s ability to implement new 
technologies and business methods, including digital services and technologies, and ability to successfully compete with both existing and new financial service 
providers, some of which may not be regulated to the same extent; (xvii) limitations on the effectiveness of UBS’s internal processes for risk management, risk 
control, measurement and modeling, and of financial models generally; (xviii) the occurrence of operational failures, such as fraud, misconduct, unauthorized 
trading, financial crime, cyberattacks, data leakage and systems failures, the risk of which is increased with cyberattack threats from both nation states and nonnation-state actors targeting financial institutions; (xix) restrictions on the ability of UBS Group AG and UBS AG to make payments or distributions, including due 
to restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to make loans or distributions, directly or indirectly, or, in the case of financial difficulties, due to the exercise by 
FINMA or the regulators of UBS’s operations in other countries of their broad statutory powers in relation to protective measures, restructuring and liquidation 
proceedings; (xx) the degree to which changes in regulation, capital or legal structure, financial results or other factors may affect UBS’s ability to maintain its 
stated capital return objective; (xxi) uncertainty over the scope of actions that may be required by UBS, governments and others for UBS to achieve goals relating 
to climate, environmental and social matters, as well as the evolving nature of underlying science and industry and the possibility of conflict between different 
governmental standards and regulatory regimes; (xxii) the ability of UBS to access capital markets; (xxiii) the ability of UBS to successfully recover from a disaster 
or other business continuity problem due to a hurricane, flood, earthquake, terrorist attack, war, conflict (e.g., the Russia–Ukraine war), pandemic, security 
breach, cyberattack, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made event, including the ability to function remotely during long-term 
disruptions such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic; (xxiv) the level of success in the absorption of Credit Suisse, in the integration of the two groups and 
their businesses, and in the execution of the planned strategy regarding cost reduction and divestment of any non-core assets, the existing assets and liabilities 
of Credit Suisse, the level of resulting impairments and write-downs, the effect of the consummation of the integration on the operational results, share price 
and credit rating of UBS – delays, difficulties, or failure in closing the transaction may cause market disruption and challenges for UBS to maintain business, 
contractual and operational relationships; and (xxv) the effect that these or other factors or unanticipated events, including media reports and speculations, may 
have on our reputation and the additional consequences that this may have on our business and performance. The sequence in which the factors above are 
presented is not indicative of their likelihood of occurrence or the potential magnitude of their consequences. Our business and financial performance could be 
affected by other factors identified in our past and future filings and reports, including those filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). 
More detailed information about those factors is set forth in documents furnished by UBS and filings made by UBS with the SEC, including the UBS Group AG 
and UBS AG Annual Reports on Form 20- F for the year ended 31 December 2023. UBS is not under any obligation to (and expressly disclaims any obligation to) 
update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

The combination of UBS and Credit Suisse is the first merger of two Global Systemically Important Financial Institutions in history 
and a pivotal moment for the Swiss banking industry. Building on the heritage of the combined firm, we want to write the next 
successful chapter by serving private, institutional and corporate clients worldwide, as well as retail clients in Switzerland and

employees apply the highest standards of business ethics and personal integrity to all of our business dealings and interactions. 
The Organization Regulations constitute the Group’s primary corporate governance guidelines establishing a corporate 
governance structure for UBS Group AG and its subsidiaries. These Organization Regulations have been approved by the Board 
of UBS Group AG, they comply with all relevant corporate governance requirements but are not intended in any way to be a 
substitute for mandatory provisions of law, rules or regulations applicable to the Group.
In the interest of transparency, the Organization Regulations are published on our website.

Exhibit 2(d)
UBS GROUP AG
DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES REGISTERED UNDER SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT 
OF 1934
1
Description of the Corporation’s Ordinary Shares
The following summary of UBS Group AG’s (the “Corporation”) ordinary shares (the “shares”) is based on and qualified by 
the Corporation’s Articles of Association and the laws of Switzerland. For a complete description of the terms and provisions 
of the shares refer to the Corporation’s Articles of Association, which are filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 
20-F. Throughout this exhibit, references to “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to the Corporation.
General
At year-end 2023, UBS Group AG had 3,462,087,722 issued shares with a nominal value of USD 0.10 each, equating to a 
share capital of USD 346,208,772.20. The shares are fully paid up, and there is no liability of shareholders to further capital 
calls by the Corporation.
The shares rank pari passu in all respects with each other, including voting rights, entitlement to dividends, share of the 
liquidation proceeds in case of the liquidation of the Corporation, preemptive rights in the event of a share issue (Bezugsrechte) 
and advance subscription rights in the event of the issuance of equity-linked securities (Vorwegzeichnungsrechte).
At the Corporation’s 2023 annual general meeting of shareholders held on 5 April 2023, shareholders approved the change of 
the share capital currency of the Corporation from the Swiss franc to the US dollar, which was implemented with retroactive 
effect as of 1 January 2023 for accounting purposes. As a result, the nominal value per share has changed from CHF 0.10 to 
USD 0.10.
The shares are registered shares (Namenaktien), are issued as uncertificated securities (einfache Wertrechte) (in the sense of 
the Swiss Code of Obligations) and, in the case of shares registered in the Corporation’s Swiss register, constitute 
intermediated securities (Bucheffekten) (in the sense of the Swiss Federal Intermediated Securities Act).
The shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. They are also listed on the NYSE as global registered shares. As such, the 
shares can be traded and transferred across applicable borders, without the need for conversion, with identical shares traded on 
different stock exchanges in different currencies. We do not apply any restrictions or limitations on the transferability of 
shares.
Shareholders registered in the Corporation’s share register may at any time request from the Corporation a confirmation of the 
shares that they hold according to the share register. However, shareholders have no right to request the printing and delivery 
of certificates for shares or the conversion of the shares into another form. In contrast, the Corporation may print and deliver 
certificates for shares (individual share certificates, certificates representing multiples of shares or global certificates) at any 
time. It may also withdraw shares that constitute intermediated securities from the applicable custody system. With the consent 
of the applicable shareholder, the Corporation may cancel issued certificates (if any) that are returned to it without 
replacement.
Share Register
Swiss law and the Corporation’s Articles of Association require the Corporation to keep a share register in which the names, 
addresses and nationality (or registered office in the case of legal entities) of the owners of the shares are recorded. The main 
function of the share register is to register shareholders entitled to vote and participate in shareholders’ meetings, or to assert or 
exercise other rights related to voting rights.
The Corporation’s share register is split into two parts – a Swiss register, which is maintained by UBS Group AG, acting as 
Swiss transfer agent, and a U.S. register, which is maintained by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., c/o Computershare 
Investor Services, P.O. Box 505000, Louisville, KY 40233-5000, United States, as U.S. transfer agent.
In order to register shares in the Corporation’s share register, a shareholder must file a share registration form with the share 
register. Failing such registration, a shareholder may not vote at or participate in a shareholders’ meeting but will still be 
entitled to receive dividends and other rights with financial value such as preemptive rights in the event of a share issue 
(Bezugsrechte) and advance subscription rights in the event of the issuance of equity-linked securities 
(Vorwegzeichnungsrechte). Shareholders registered in the Corporation’s share register may at any time request from the 
Corporation a confirmation of the shares that they hold according to the Corporation’s share register.
Dividend Rights and Dividends
Shareholders are entitled to the dividends or other distributions approved by the shareholders’ meeting in proportion to their 
shareholdings.
Swiss law requires that at least 5% of the annual net profits of the Corporation must be retained and booked as statutory 
retained earnings until these retained earnings equal, together with the Corporation’s statutory capital reserve, no less than 20% 
of the Corporation’s share capital registered in the commercial register of the Canton of Zurich. Any remaining net profit of the 
Corporation may be allocated by the shareholders represented at the applicable shareholders’ meeting.
2
Under Swiss law, dividends may be paid by the Corporation only if, based on its audited standalone financial statements 
prepared in accordance with Swiss law, the Corporation has sufficient distributable profits from the previous financial years or 
if the reserves of the Corporation are sufficient to allow distribution of a dividend. In either event, dividends may be paid by 
the Corporation only after approval by the shareholders’ meeting. The Corporation’s board of directors may propose to the 
shareholders that a dividend be paid, but cannot itself set the dividend. The Corporation’s statutory auditors must confirm that 
any dividend proposal of the Corporation’s board of directors is in accordance with Swiss law and the Corporation’s Articles 
of Association. In addition, any interim dividend may be paid based on an interim account. The provisions governing dividends 
also apply to any such interim dividends.
Dividends are usually due and payable not earlier than three days after the shareholders’ resolution relating to the allocation of 
profits has been passed. Under Swiss law, the statute of limitations in respect of dividend payments is five years (dividends not 
paid are allocated to a special reserve of the Corporation).
The Corporation declares dividends in U.S. dollars. Shareholders holding their shares through the Depository Trust Company 
or the U.S. transfer agent will receive dividend payments in U.S. dollars. Shareholders holding their shares through SIX SIS 
receive dividends in Swiss francs, based on a published exchange rate calculated up to five decimal places, on the day prior to 
the ex-dividend date.
Voting Rights
In principle, each share carries one vote at a shareholders’ meeting. Swiss law distinguishes between registration with and 
without voting rights. Shareholders must be registered in the Corporation’s share register as shareholders with voting rights in 
order to vote and participate in shareholders’ meetings or to assert or exercise other rights related to voting rights. We place no 
restrictions on share ownership and voting rights. However, pursuant to general principles formulated by the Corporation’s 
board of directors, nominees, which normally represent a large number of individual shareholders and may hold an unlimited 
number of shares, have voting rights limited to a maximum of 5% of all issued shares if they agree to disclose, upon our 
request, beneficial owners holding 0.3% or more of all issued shares. This 5% limit has been implemented to avoid large 
shareholders being entered in the Corporation’s share register via nominee companies so as to exercise influence without 
directly registering their shares with the Corporation. An exception to the 5% voting limit rule is in place for securities clearing 
organizations, such as the Depository Trust Company.
Unless otherwise provided by Swiss law or the Corporation’s Articles of Association, resolutions require the approval of a 
majority of the votes represented, excluding blank and invalid ballots, at a shareholders’ meeting in order to be passed. 
Under Swiss corporate law (or Swiss banking law, as the case may be), a resolution passed at a shareholders’ meeting with the 
approval of at least a two-thirds majority of the votes, and a majority of the nominal value of shares, in each case represented at 
such meeting is required in order to approve certain specific issues. Such issues include introducing shares with preferential 
voting rights, any restriction on the transferability of registered shares, the creation of conditional capital, the introduction 
capital band or the introduction of reserve capital, restricting or excluding preemptive rights in the event of a share issue 
(Bezugsrechte), and, in certain circumstances, restricting or excluding advance subscription rights in the event of the issuance 
of equity-linked securities (Vorwegzeichnungsrechte).
The Corporation’s Articles of Association require a resolution passed at a shareholders’ meeting with the approval of at least a 
two-thirds majority of the votes represented at such meeting in order to approve any change to their provisions regarding the 
number of members of the board of directors, any decision to remove one-quarter or more of the members of the board of 
directors or the deletion or modification of the provision thereof establishing these supermajority requirements.
Shareholder ownership disclosure
Under the Swiss Federal Act on Financial Market Infrastructures and Market Conduct in Securities and Derivatives Trading of 
June 19, 2015, as amended, anyone who directly, indirectly or acting in concert with third parties, acquires or disposes of 
shares in a company listed in Switzerland or holds other purchase or sale positions relating to such shares, and, thereby, 
directly, indirectly or in concert with third parties reaches, falls below or exceeds one of the following percentage thresholds: 
3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 331
⁄3, 50 or 662
⁄3% of the voting rights in such company, regardless of whether or not such rights may be 
exercised, must notify the company and the Swiss stock exchange on which such shares are listed. Nominee companies that 
cannot autonomously decide how voting rights are exercised are not required to notify the company and such stock exchange if 
they reach, exceed or fall below the aforementioned thresholds.
Board of Directors
The term of office for each member of the Corporation’s board of directors is until the next annual general meeting of 
shareholders. Pursuant to the Corporation’s organizational regulations, board members are generally expected to serve for at 
least three years and no board member may serve for more than 10 consecutive terms of office. In exceptional circumstances 
the Corporation’s board of directors can extend this limit.
Members whose term of office has expired are immediately eligible for re-election.
3
Liquidation Rights
In the event of liquidation of the Corporation’s assets, shareholders are entitled to a proportional share after all debts have been 
paid.
Repurchase of Shares
Swiss law limits the Corporation’s ability to hold or repurchase shares. The Corporation and its subsidiaries may repurchase 
shares only if and to the extent that (i) the Corporation has freely distributable reserves in the amount of the purchase price and 
(ii) the aggregate nominal value of all shares held by the Corporation and its subsidiaries does not exceed 10% of the 
Corporation’s nominal share capital (or 20% of its nominal share capital in specific circumstances). Repurchases for 
cancellation purposes approved by the shareholders’ meeting are not subject to the 10% threshold for the Corporation’s own 
shares within the meaning of article 659 paragraph 2 of the Swiss Code of Obligations. The Corporation must create a special 
reserve in its standalone financial statements prepared in accordance with Swiss law in the amount of the purchase price of any 
repurchased shares. Furthermore, in the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements, own shares are recorded at cost and 
reported as treasury shares, resulting in a reduction in total shareholders’ equity. Shares held by the Corporation or any of its 
subsidiaries do not carry any rights to vote at shareholders’ meetings.
Preemptive and Advanced Subscription Rights
Under Swiss law, any share issue, whether for cash or non-cash consideration or for no consideration, is subject to the prior 
approval of the shareholders’ meeting. Existing shareholders of a Swiss corporation have certain preemptive rights in the event 
of a share issue (Bezugsrechte) and advance subscription rights in the event of the issuance of equity-linked securities 
(Vorwegzeichnungsrechte) to subscribe for the new shares or equity-linked securities, as the case may be, in proportion to the 
nominal amount of shares held. However, the articles of association of the corporation, or a resolution approved at a 
shareholders’ meeting by at least a two-thirds majority of the votes, and a majority of the nominal value of the shares, in each 
case represented at the meeting, may limit or exclude such preemptive or advance subscription rights in certain limited 
circumstances.

subclause (i) of this clause (c), the Issuer will procure the prompt delivery (free 
of charge) of Definitive Certificates to the Fiscal Agent, duly executed without 
interest coupons, registered in the names of the relevant Indirect Holders, 
addresses and denominations provided in a written notice to be given by the 
Depositary or the Issuer to the Fiscal Agent (which notice shall be given subject 
to the Depositary's procedures and also specify the taxpayer identification 
number, if any, of each Person in whose name such Definitive Certificates are to 
be registered). Upon written direction of the Issuer, the Fiscal Agent will deliver 
such Definitive Certificates to the Holders thereof no later than five Business 
Days after receipt by the Fiscal Agent of the written notice provided by the 
Depositary (or the Issuer, as applicable) referred to above (and any other 
necessary information as the Fiscal Agent may reasonably request from the 
Issuer at such
10272857175-v14 82 70-41061831
time). The Fiscal Agent shall promptly cancel and deliver to the Issuer the 
surrendered Global Certificates. The form of Definitive Certificate that will be 
issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in a Note represented by a Rule 
144A Global Certificate and the form of Definitive Certificate that will be 
issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in a Note represented by a 
Regulation S Global Certificate are set out in the Fiscal Agency Agreement, 
which will be made available by the Registrar to any Holder or Indirect Holder 
upon written request.
(iii) If Definitive Certificates have been issued pursuant to this Condition 2(c), any 
Definitive Certificate that is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed may be 
replaced, subject to applicable laws and regulations, at the Specified Office of the 
Fiscal Agent upon payment by the claimant of the fees, costs and expenses 
incurred by the Fiscal Agent and the Issuer in connection therewith and on such 
terms as to evidence, security and indemnity (which may provide, among other 
things, that if the Definitive Certificate allegedly or actually lost, stole or 
destroyed is subsequently presented for payment there shall be paid to the Issuer 
on demand the amount payable by the Issuer in respect of such Definitive 
Certificate subsequently presented) as the Issuer may require. Mutilated or 
defaced Definitive Certificates must be surrendered before replacements will be 
issued.
3. TRANSFER
(a) General
(i) Subject to Conditions 3(b) and 3(c), title to Notes will pass on transfer by 
assignment (Zession) and due registration in the Register. All transfers of Notes 
and entries on the Register will be made subject to the provisions concerning 
transfers of Notes set forth in the Fiscal Agency Agreement, which will be made 
available by the Registrar to any Holder or Indirect Holder upon written request.
(ii) Transfers of Notes, or of beneficial interests in Notes represented by Global 
Certificates, may be made only in accordance with the legend set forth upon the 
face of the applicable Global Certificate or Definitive Certificate, and the 
Registrar will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any Note or 
beneficial interests in Notes except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to 
the Fiscal Agent and the Registrar that such transfer is being made in compliance 
with such legend.
(iii) Transfers of Notes and the issue of new Global Certificates or Definitive 
Certificates, as the case may be, on transfer will be effected without charge by or 
on behalf of the Issuer or the Registrar, but upon payment of any tax or other 
governmental charges that may be imposed in relation to the transfer (or the 
giving of such indemnity as the Fiscal Agent or the Registrar may require) by the 
Holder.
(iv) No Holder may require the transfer of a Note to be registered (x) if the Notes are 
to be redeemed pursuant to Condition 6 (Redemption and Purchase), during the 
period of 15 days ending on (and including) the relevant Redemption Date, or
(y) during the period of 15 days ending on (and including) the Record Date for 
any Interest Payment Date.
No Person (including any Indirect Holder) other than the Holder(s) will have 
any rights, or be owed any obligations by the Issuer, under the Notes. Payments 
of principal, interest or any other amount in respect of Notes will be made only 
to the Person shown on the Register as the registered holder of such Note (i.e., 
the Holder) at close of business on the relevant Record Date.
(b) Transfer of Notes represented by a Global Certificate
10272857175-v14 83 70-41061831
(i) Global Certificates may be transferred only in whole, but not in part, and only to 
a Relevant Clearing System or any of their respective successors or nominees, in 
each case located outside of Switzerland, except as provided below. Beneficial 
interests of Indirect Holders in Notes represented by Global Certificates may be 
transferred only in accordance with the rules and procedures of such Relevant 
Clearing System, the provisions of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and this 
Condition 3(b).
(ii) A beneficial interest in a Note represented by a Regulation S Global Certificate 
may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial 
interest in a Note represented by a Rule 144A Global Certificate during the 
Distribution Compliance Period, only if such exchange occurs in connection with 
a transfer of beneficial interests in the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A and the 
transferor first delivers to the Fiscal Agent and the Registrar a written certificate 
substantially in the form of a certificate available on request from the Registrar to 
the effect that the beneficial interests in the Notes are being transferred to a Person 
who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A 
under the US Securities Act, purchasing the beneficial interests in the Notes for 
its own account or the account of a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements 
of Rule 144A and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states 
of the United States and other jurisdictions.
(iii) A beneficial interest in a Note represented by a Rule 144A Global Certificate may 
be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest 
in a Note represented by a Regulation S Global Certificate, whether before or after 
the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, only if the transferor first 
delivers to the Fiscal Agent and the Registrar a written certificate substantially in 
the form of a certificate available on request from the Registrar to the effect that 
the transfer is being conducted in compliance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of 
Regulation S under the US Securities Act.
(iv) Until the termination of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests 
in any Regulation S Global Certificate may be held only through participants 
acting for and on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, provided 
that this subclause (iv) shall not prohibit any transfer in accordance with 
subclause (ii) of this Condition 3(b).
(c) Transfer of Notes represented by a Definitive Certificate
(i) If and when Definitive Certificates have been issued pursuant to Condition 2(c), 
one or more Notes may be transferred only in accordance with the legends set 
forth upon the face of the relevant Definitive Certificate and only upon the 
surrender (at the Specified Office of the Registrar) of the Definitive Certificate 
representing such Notes to be transferred, together with the form of transfer 
attached to such Definitive Certificate (or another form of transfer substantially 
in the same form and containing the same representations and certifications (if 
any), unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer), duly completed and executed and 
any other evidence as the Fiscal Agent and the Registrar may reasonably 
require. A new Definitive Certificate shall be issued to the transferee in respect 
of the Notes that are the subject of the relevant transfer and, in the case of a 
transfer of part only of a holding of Notes represented by one Definitive 
Certificate, a new Definitive Certificate in respect of the balance of the Notes 
not transferred shall be issued to the transferor. In the case of a transfer of Notes 
to a Person who is already a Holder, a new Definitive Certificate representing 
the enlarged holding may be issued but only against surrender of the Definitive 
Certificate representing the existing holding of such Person.
(ii) Each new Definitive Certificate to be issued pursuant to Condition 2(c) shall be 
available for delivery within three Relevant Banking Days of receipt of the form 
of transfer and surrender of the relevant Definitive Certificate. Delivery of new 
Definitive Certificate(s) will be made at the Specified Office of the Fiscal Agent
10272857175-v14 84 70-41061831
to which delivery and surrender of such form of transfer and Definitive Certificate 
or, as the case may be, surrender of such Definitive Certificate, will have been 
made or, at the option of the relevant Holder and as specified in the relevant form 
of transfer or otherwise in writing, be mailed by uninsured post at the risk of the 
Holder entitled to the new Definitive Certificate to such address as may be so 
specified, unless such Holder requests otherwise and pays in advance to the Fiscal 
Agent the costs of such other method of delivery and/or such insurance as it may 
specify.
(d) Rule 144A
Each Note that is initially sold in the United States to a QIB will not be registered under 
the US Securities Act, or with any securities regulatory authority of any state or other 
jurisdiction of the United States and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred, 
except (i) in accordance with Rule 144A to a Person that the Holder and any Person acting 
on its behalf reasonably believe is a QIB that is acquiring the Notes for its own account or 
for the account of one or more QIBs, (ii) in an offshore transaction in accordance with 
Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S under the US Securities Act, (iii) pursuant to an 
exemption from registration under Rule 144 under the US Securities Act, or in accordance 
with another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, registration under the US 
Securities Act, if available, or (iv) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 
US Securities Act, in each case, in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any 
state of the United States.
4. STATUS AND SUBORDINATION
(a) Status
The Notes constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer and rank 
pari passu and without any preference among themselves. The rights and claims of the 
Holders against the Issuer under the Notes are subordinated as described in clause (b) of 
this Condition 4.
(b) Subordination
In the event of (i) a Bankruptcy Event or (ii) an order being made, or an effective 
resolution being passed, for the liquidation or winding-up of the Issuer (except, in any such 
case, a solvent liquidation or winding-up of the Issuer solely for purposes of a 
reorganisation, reconstruction or amalgamation of the Issuer or the substitution in place of 
the Issuer of a successor in business to the Issuer, the terms of which reorganisation, 
reconstruction, amalgamation or substitution (x) have previously been approved by a valid 
resolution of the Holders and (y) do not provide that the Notes shall become redeemable in 
accordance with these Terms and Conditions),
(i) if such event occurs (x) prior to the occurrence of a Conversion Capital 
Availability Event, or (y) on or after the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event but prior to the occurrence of a Conversion 
Event, the rights and claims of the Holders against the Issuer in respect 
of or arising under (including, without limitation, any damages awarded 
for breach of any obligation under) the Notes will, subject to any 
obligations that are mandatorily preferred by law, rank (A) junior to the 
rights and claims of all holders of Senior Obligations,
(B) pari passu with the rights and claims of holders of Parity 
Obligations, and
(C) senior to the rights and claims of holders of Junior Obligations; 
provided, however, that, if a Conversion Event subsequently occurs while 
such Bankruptcy Event or liquidation or winding-up, as the case may be, 
is continuing, the rights and claims of the Holders against the Issuer in 
respect of the delivery of Ordinary Shares in accordance with Condition 
9 (Conversion) will rank as set forth in subclause (ii) below; or
(ii) if such event occurs on or after the occurrence of a Conversion Event, 
the rights and claims of the Holders against the Issuer in respect of the 
delivery of Ordinary
10272857175-v14 85 70-41061831
Shares in accordance with Condition 9 (Conversion) will rank (A) junior 
to the rights and claims of all holders of Senior Obligations, (B) junior to 
the rights and claims of holders of Parity Obligations, and (C) pari passu 
with the rights and claims of holders of Junior Obligations.
(c) Claims subject to a Contingent Write-down or a Conversion
Any claim of any Holder in respect of or arising under the Notes (including, without 
limitation, any claim in relation to any unsatisfied payment obligation of the Issuer 
subject to enforcement by any Holder pursuant to Condition 13 (Events of Default) or in 
relation to the occurrence of any other Event of Default) will be subject to, and 
superseded by, Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), as 
applicable, irrespective of whether the relevant Trigger Event or Viability Event, as 
applicable, has occurred, or, in the case of a Viability Event, the relevant Viability Event 
Notice has been given, prior to or after the occurrence of an Event of Default or any 
other event.
5. INTEREST
(a) Interest Payment Dates
(i) Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) 
and clause (g) of this Condition 5, the Notes will bear interest on their principal 
amount (A) from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the First Call 
Date, at the Fixed Interest Rate, and (B) thereafter, at the applicable Reset 
Interest Rate.
(ii) Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) 
and clause (h) of this Condition 5, interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually in arrear on 13 May and 13 November of each year (each, an "Interest 
Payment Date"), commencing on 13 May 2024.
(b) Determination of the Treasury Yield, the Reset Interest Rate and the Reset Interest 
Amount in relation to each Reset Interest Period
With respect to each Reset Interest Period, the Calculation Agent will, as soon as 
practicable on the Reset Determination Date in relation to such Reset Interest Period, 
determine the Treasury Yield and the Reset Interest Rate for such Reset Interest Period 
and calculate the amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount on the Interest 
Payment Date in relation to each Interest Period falling in such Reset Interest Period (each, 
a "Reset Interest Amount").
(c) Publication of Reset Interest Rate and interest amount payable upon redemption
With respect to each Reset Interest Period, as soon as practicable after such determination 
but in any event no later than the relevant Reset Date, the Calculation Agent will cause
(i) the relevant Reset Interest Rate and the relevant Reset Interest Amount determined by 
it, together with the Interest Payment Date in relation to each Interest Period falling in 
such Reset Interest Period, to be notified to the Issuer and the Paying Agents and (ii) the 
relevant Reset Interest Rate determined by it to be notified to any stock exchange or other 
relevant authority on which the Notes are at the relevant time listed and to be published in 
accordance with Condition 15 (Notices).
The Calculation Agent shall calculate any interest amount payable on any Redemption 
Date (if the Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to Condition 6 (Redemption and 
Purchase)) and cause such interest amount to be notified to Issuer and the Paying Agents 
and to any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the Notes are at the 
relevant time listed and to be published in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) no 
later than two Business Days prior to such Redemption Date.
10272857175-v14 86 70-41061831
(d) Calculation of amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount
Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) and clause 
(h) of this Condition 5:
(i) the amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount on each Interest Payment 
Date to (and including) the First Call Date in respect of the Notes will be 
USD 46.25; and
(ii) if interest is required to be paid in respect of a Note on any other date (including, 
for the avoidance of doubt, the Reset Interest Amount), the amount of interest 
payable per Calculation Amount on such date will be calculated by:
(A) applying the applicable Interest Rate to the Calculation Amount;
(B) multiplying the product thereof by the Day Count Fraction; and
(C) rounding the resulting figure to the nearest cent (half a cent being 
rounded upwards).
(e) Calculation of amount of interest payable per Note
Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) and 
clause (h) of this Condition 5, the amount of interest payable in respect of a Note will be 
the product of:
(i) the amount of interest per Calculation Amount; and
(ii) the number by which the Calculation Amount is required to be multiplied to equal 
the denomination of such Note.
(f) Notifications, etc. to be final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and 
decisions given, expressed, made or obtained by the Calculation Agent for purposes of 
this Condition 5 will (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith and manifest error) be 
binding on the Issuer, the Agents and the Holders and (in the absence of wilful default 
and bad faith) no liability to the Issuer or the Holders will attach to the Calculation 
Agent in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by the Calculation Agent of its 
powers, duties and discretions under this Condition 5.
(g) Accrual of interest in the case of redemption or a Trigger Event or a Viability Event
(i) Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), 
if the Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to clause (b), (c) or (d) of Condition 6 
(Redemption and Purchase), interest on the Notes will accrue to (but excluding) 
the relevant Redemption Date, and will cease to accrue on such Redemption 
Date; provided, however, that if the payment with respect to any Note is 
improperly withheld or refused on such Redemption Date, interest will continue 
to accrue on the principal amount of such Note (both before and after judgment) 
at the relevant Interest Rate to the Relevant Date.
(ii) Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event or a Viability Event, interest on the 
Notes will cease to accrue from (and including) the date on which such Trigger 
Event or Viability Event occurs.
(h) Cancellation of interest; prohibited interest
(i) The Issuer may, in its sole discretion, elect to cancel all or part of any payment 
of interest on the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any related 
Additional Amounts) that is otherwise scheduled to be paid on an Interest 
Payment Date. This subclause (h)(i) is without prejudice to the provisions of
10272857175-v14 87 70-41061831
subclause (h)(ii) of this Condition 5. Non-payment of any amount of interest by 
the Issuer to the Fiscal Agent will constitute evidence of cancellation of the 
relevant payment, whether or not notice of cancellation has been given by the 
Issuer.
If practicable, the Issuer shall provide notice of any cancellation of interest (in 
whole or in part) pursuant to this subclause (h)(i) to the Holders on or prior to the 
relevant Interest Payment Date. If practicable, the Issuer shall endeavour to 
provide such notice at least five Business Days prior to the relevant Interest 
Payment Date. Failure to provide such notice will not have any impact on the 
effectiveness of, or otherwise invalidate, any such cancellation of interest, or give 
Holders any rights as a result of such failure.
(ii) The Issuer will be prohibited from making, in whole or in part, any payment of 
interest on the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any related 
Additional Amounts) on the relevant Interest Payment Date if and to the extent 
that:
(A) the amount of Distributable Items as at such Interest Payment Date is 
less than the sum of (1) the amount of such interest payment, plus (2) 
all other payments (other than redemption payments) made by UBS 
Group AG on or in respect of the Notes or any Parity Obligations or 
Junior Obligations since the balance sheet date of the Relevant 
Accounts and prior to such Interest Payment Date, plus (3) all payments 
(other than redemption payments) payable by UBS Group AG on such 
Interest Payment Date on or in respect of any Parity Obligations or 
Junior Obligations, in the case of each of subclauses (1), (2) and (3), 
excluding any portion of such payments already accounted for in 
determining the amount of such Distributable Items; and/or
(B) UBS Group AG is not, or will not immediately after the relevant 
payment of interest be, in compliance with all applicable minimum 
capital adequacy requirements of the National Regulations on a 
consolidated (Finanzgruppe) basis (for the avoidance of doubt, it being 
understood that such minimum requirements will reflect any reduction 
in such requirements granted by FINMA to the Group pursuant to the 
Capital Adequacy Ordinance); and/or
(C) FINMA has required the Issuer not to make such interest payment.
The Issuer shall deliver a certificate signed by the Authorised Signatories to the 
Fiscal Agent and shall give notice in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) to 
the Holders, in each case as soon as practicable following any determination that 
interest is required to be cancelled pursuant to this subclause (h)(ii) or, where no 
such prior determination is made, promptly following any Interest Payment Date 
on which interest was scheduled to be paid if such interest is being cancelled in 
accordance with this subclause (h)(ii), to such effect setting out brief details as 
to the amount of interest being cancelled and the reason therefor. Failure to 
provide such certificate and notice will not have any impact on the effectiveness 
of, or otherwise invalidate, any such cancellation or give any Holder any rights 
as a result of such failure.
(iii) If, on any Interest Payment Date, any payment of interest scheduled to be made 
on such date is not made in full pursuant to subclause (h)(i) or subclause (h)(ii) of 
this Condition 5, UBS Group AG shall not, directly or indirectly,
(A) recommend to Shareholders that any dividend or other distribution in 
cash or in kind (other than in the form of Ordinary Shares) be paid or 
made on any Ordinary Shares; or
10272857175-v14 88 70-41061831
(B) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any Ordinary Shares other than as 
a Permitted Transaction,
in each case unless and until (x) the interest payment due and payable on the 
Notes on any subsequent Interest Payment Date has been paid in full (or an 
amount equal to the same has been paid in full to a designated third party trust 
account for the benefit of the Holders prior to payment by the trustee thereof to 
the Holders on such subsequent Interest Payment Date) or, if earlier, (y) all 
outstanding Notes have been cancelled in accordance with these Terms and 
Conditions.
(iv) Payments of interest on the Notes are not cumulative. Notwithstanding any other 
provision in these Terms and Conditions, the cancellation or non-payment of 
any interest amount by virtue of this Condition 5(h) will not constitute a default 
for any purpose (including, without limitation, Condition 13 (Events of Default)) 
on the part of the Issuer. Any interest payment not paid by virtue of this 
Condition 5(h) will not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter, and 
Holders will have no right thereto.
(v) If UBS Group AG determines, after consultation with FINMA, that the Notes do 
not, or will cease to, fully qualify as Additional Tier 1 Capital, (A) the Issuer 
shall not, to the extent permitted under National Regulations, exercise its 
discretion pursuant to subclause (h)(i) of this Condition 5 to cancel any interest 
payments due on the Notes on any Interest Payment Date following the 
occurrence of such determination, and (B) the Issuer shall give notice to the 
Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) as soon as practicable after 
such determination stating that the Issuer may no longer exercise its discretion 
pursuant to subclause (h)(i) of this Condition 5 to cancel any interest payments 
as from the date of such notice.
6. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE
(a) No fixed redemption date
The Notes are perpetual securities in respect of which there is no fixed redemption date. 
Unless previously redeemed (including by way of Conversion pursuant to Condition 9 
(Conversion)) or purchased and cancelled in accordance with this Condition 6 and 
subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), the Notes 
are perpetual and may only be redeemed or purchased in accordance with this Condition 
6.
(b) Redemption at the option of the Issuer
Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 6, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to 
redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, on the First Call Date or any Interest 
Payment Date thereafter at their aggregate principal amount, together with any accrued 
and unpaid interest thereon to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date.
(c) Redemption due to a Tax Event
(i) Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 6, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event at 
any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to 
redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, on the relevant Redemption Date at 
their aggregate principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest 
thereon to (but excluding) such Redemption Date.
(ii) A "Tax Event" will have occurred if the Issuer in making any payments on the 
Notes (A) has paid, or will or would on the next payment date be required to 
pay, Additional Amounts, or (B) has paid, or will or would be required to pay, 
any additional Tax in respect of the Notes, in the case of each of subclauses (A) 
and (B), under the laws or regulations of a Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof or any authority of or in a Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof having the power to impose, levy, collect, withhold or assess 
Taxes, including, without limitation, any treaty to which a Tax Jurisdiction is a 
party, or
10272857175-v14 89 70-41061831
any generally published application or interpretation of such laws (including, 
without limitation, a decision of any court or tribunal, any generally published 
application or interpretation of such laws by any relevant tax authority or any 
generally published pronouncement by any relevant tax authority), and the Issuer 
cannot avoid the foregoing by taking measures reasonably available to it.
(d) Redemption due to a Regulatory Event
(i) Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 6, upon the occurrence of a Regulatory 
Event at any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, 
to redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, on the relevant Redemption Date at 
their aggregate principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest 
thereon to (but excluding) such Redemption Date.
(ii) A "Regulatory Event" will have occurred if any of the Notes ceases to be eligible 
in full to be (A) treated as Additional Tier 1 Capital, and/or (B) counted towards 
either the Going-Concern LR Requirement or the Going-Concern RWA 
Requirement (or both).
(e) Conditions for redemption
(i) If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes pursuant to clause (b), (c) or (d) of this 
Condition 6, then the Issuer shall give the Holders not less than 15 and not more 
than 60 days' prior notice in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) (a 
"Redemption Notice"), which notice shall, subject to subclauses (ii) and (iii) of 
this clause (e), be irrevocable and specify (x) the clause of this Condition 6 
pursuant to which the redemption is to be made, (y) if any Definitive Certificates 
have been issued, the method by which Notes to be redeemed will be tendered, 
and (z) the date (which date, in the case of a redemption pursuant to clause (c) or
(d) of this Condition 6, shall be a Payment Business Day) on which the Issuer 
will redeem the Notes pursuant to such clause of this Condition 6 (such specified 
date, the "Redemption Date").
(ii) The Issuer may only redeem the Notes pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of this 
Condition 6 on the relevant Redemption Date if FINMA has approved such 
redemption on or prior to such Redemption Date, if such approval is then required 
under applicable Swiss laws and regulations.
(iii) The Issuer may only redeem the Notes pursuant to any clause of this Condition 6 
on the relevant Redemption Date if no Trigger Event or Viability Event has 
occurred prior to such Redemption Date.
(iv) If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes pursuant to clause (c) or (d) of this 
Condition 6, then prior to the publication of the Redemption Notice pursuant to 
subclause (e)(i) of this Condition 6, the Issuer shall deliver to the Fiscal Agent 
(A) a certificate signed by the Authorised Signatories stating that the relevant 
requirement or circumstance giving rise to the right to redeem under clause (c) or 
(d), as applicable, of this Condition 6 is satisfied and the reasons therefor and such 
certificate will be conclusive and binding on the Holders, and (B) in the case of a 
redemption pursuant to clause (c) of this Condition 6 only, an opinion of 
independent legal advisers of recognised standing to the effect that circumstances 
entitling the Issuer to exercise its right of redemption under clause (c) of this 
Condition 6 have arisen.
(f) Purchases
The Issuer or any other member of the Group or any of their respective affiliates may at 
any time purchase Notes at any price in the open market or otherwise, provided that
(i) such purchase complies with any limits or conditions to which any member of the 
Group is subject under applicable banking laws and regulations at the time of such 
purchase, (ii) other than in the case of purchases made in connection with stabilisation
10272857175-v14 90 70-41061831
measures in compliance with applicable law or in connection with any market making in 
the Notes, FINMA has approved such purchase (if such approval is then required under 
applicable Swiss laws and regulations) on or prior to the date of such purchase, and (iii) no 
Trigger Event or Viability Event has occurred prior to the date of such purchase. Any 
Notes so purchased may, at the option of the Issuer, be held, reissued, resold or cancelled.
(g) Cancellation
All Notes redeemed in accordance with this Condition 6 or by way of Conversion 
pursuant to Condition 9 (Conversion) will be cancelled and may not be reissued or 
resold; provided, however, that, in the case of Notes redeemed by way of Conversion, 
the Issuer will not take any action to cause such Notes to be removed from the Relevant 
Clearing System prior to the later of (i) the applicable Settlement Date and (ii) the Final 
Cancellation Date. Following the issuance and delivery of the relevant Ordinary Shares 
to the Settlement Share Depository on the Conversion Date and until the later of (i) the 
applicable Settlement Date and (ii) the Final Cancellation Date, the Notes will evidence 
solely the Holder's right to receive Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds, as the case 
may be, from the Settlement Share Depository or the Settlement Shares Offer Agent (or 
such other relevant recipient).
(h) Redemption of other instruments
For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that, if, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event 
or a Regulatory Event, the Issuer does not elect to redeem the Notes pursuant to this 
Condition 6, nothing in this Condition 6 or any other provision of these Terms and 
Conditions will prohibit the Issuer from redeeming (whether early, at maturity or 
otherwise) any other instruments issued by any member of the Group pursuant to the 
terms thereof.
7. TRIGGER EVENT AND VIABILITY EVENT
(a) Trigger Event
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event:
(A) if such Trigger Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Contingent Write-down will occur on the

8 (Contingent Write-down); or
(B) if such Trigger Event occurs on or after the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Conversion will occur on the applicable 
Trigger Event Conversion Date in accordance with Condition 9 
(Conversion).
(ii) A "Trigger Event" will have occurred if the Issuer gives the Holders a Trigger 
Event Notice in accordance with clause (b) of this Condition 7.
(b) Trigger Event Notice
(i) If, with respect to any Publication Date, the Trigger CET1 Ratio as of such 
Publication Date is less than the Threshold Ratio, the Issuer shall, subject to 
subclauses (ii) and (iii) of this Condition 7(b), give a notice (a "Trigger Event 
Notice") to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) (x) if such 
Publication Date is an Ordinary Publication Date, within five Business Days of 
such Ordinary Publication Date (such fifth Business Day, the "Trigger Breach 
Determination Date", and the date of such notice, the "Ordinary Trigger 
Event Notice Date"), and (y) if such Publication Date is an Extraordinary 
Publication Date, on such Extraordinary Publication Date (the "Extraordinary 
Trigger Event Notice Date"), which notice shall:

(A) if such Trigger Event Notice is given prior to the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event (1) state that the Trigger CET1 
Ratio as of such Publication Date is less than the Threshold Ratio, and a 
Contingent Write-down will take place, and (2) specify the date on 
which the Contingent Write-down will take place, which date shall, 
subject to postponement pursuant to subclause (ii) of this Condition 
7(b), be no later than 10 Business Days after the date of such notice (the 
"Trigger Event Write-down Date"); or
(B) if such Trigger Event Notice is given on or after the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, (1) state that the Trigger CET1 
Ratio as of such Publication Date is less than the Threshold Ratio, and a

Settlement Share Depository (including its Specified Office) or, if the 
Issuer is unable to appoint a Settlement Share Depository prior to 
giving of such notice, the other arrangements it has made in accordance 
with subclause (h)(i) of Condition 9 (Conversion) for the issuance and 
delivery of the Ordinary Shares to be issued and delivered upon 
Conversion to the Holders, the procedures Holders must follow to 
obtain delivery of the Ordinary Shares from the Settlement Share 
Depository, the Settlement Notice Cut-Off Date and the Final 
Cancellation Date).
(ii) If a Trigger Event Notice is required to be given pursuant to subclause (i) of this 
Condition 7(b), and on the relevant Publication Date any Higher-Trigger 
Contingent Capital is outstanding with respect to which either (x) no HigherTrigger Write-down/Conversion Notice has been given prior to the Trigger 
Event Notice Date or (y) a Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion Notice has 
been given prior to the Trigger Event Notice Date, but the Trigger Event Writedown Date or the Trigger Event Conversion Date, as applicable, is scheduled to 
occur prior to the relevant Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion Date,
(A) in the case of subclause (x) above, the giving of such Trigger Event 
Notice will be postponed until the date on which a Higher-Trigger Writedown/Conversion Notice has been given with respect to all such 
outstanding Higher-Trigger Contingent Capital and such date will be 
deemed to be the Trigger Event Notice Date; and
(B) in the case of subclauses (x) and (y) above, if the Trigger Event Writedown Date or the Trigger Event Conversion Date, as applicable, is 
scheduled to occur prior to the Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion 
Date (or, in the case of more than one Higher-Trigger Writedown/Conversion Date, the latest Higher-Trigger Writedown/Conversion Date), the Trigger Event Write-down Date or the 
Trigger Event Conversion Date, as applicable, will be postponed to the 
Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion Date (or the latest HigherTrigger Write-down/Conversion Date, as applicable) and such 
postponement shall be specified in such Trigger Event Notice.
(iii) If (A) a Trigger Event Notice is required to be given pursuant to subclause (i) of 
this Condition 7(b) in relation to an Ordinary Publication Date, and (B) prior to 
the earlier of the Ordinary Trigger Event Notice Date and the Trigger Breach 
Determination Date, FINMA, upon the request of UBS Group AG, has agreed in 
writing that a Contingent Write-down or a Conversion, as applicable, is not
10272857175-v14 92 70-41061831
required as a result of actions taken by the Group or circumstances or events, in 
each case, that have had, or imminently will have, the effect of restoring the CET1 
Ratio as of the Balance Sheet Date relating to the relevant Ordinary Publication 
Date, after giving pro forma effect to such actions, circumstances or events, to a 
level above the Threshold Ratio that FINMA and UBS Group AG deem, in their 
sole discretion, to be adequate at such time, (x) the Issuer shall not give such 
Trigger Event Notice pursuant to subclause (i) of this Condition 7(b) in relation to 
the relevant Ordinary Publication Date, and (y) the Issuer shall give notice to the 
Holders on or prior to the Trigger Breach Determination Date in accordance with 
Condition 15 (Notices), which notice shall state that no Contingent Write-down or 
Conversion, as applicable, will occur in relation to the relevant Ordinary 
Publication Date.
(c) Viability Event
(i) Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 7, upon the occurrence of a Viability Event:
(A) the Issuer shall give notice (a "Viability Event Notice") to the Holders 
in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) within three days of the date 
on which such Viability Event occurred, which notice shall:
(1) if such Viability Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, (x) state that a Viability 
Event has occurred and a Contingent Write-down will take place 
and (y) specify the date on which the Contingent Write-down 
will take place, which date shall be no later than 10 Business 
Days after the date of such notice (such specified date, the 
"Viability Event Write-down Date"); or
(2) if such Viability Event occurs on or after the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, (w) state that a Viability 
Event has occurred and a Conversion will take place, (x) specify 
the date on which the Conversion will take place, which date 
shall be no more than 20 Business Days following the 
occurrence of the Viability Event (the "Viability Event 
Conversion Date"), (y) specify the Conversion Price in effect 
on the date of such Viability Event Notice, and (z) specify the 
details of the arrangements for the settlement of the Conversion 
(including the Suspension Date, the details of the Settlement 
Share Depository (including its Specified Office) or, if the Issuer 
is unable to appoint a Settlement Share Depository prior to 
giving of such notice, the other arrangements it has made in 
accordance with subclause (h)(i) of Condition 9 (Conversion) 
for the issuance and delivery of the Ordinary Shares to be issued 
and delivered upon Conversion to the Holders, the procedures 
Holders must follow to obtain delivery of the Ordinary Shares 
from the Settlement Share Depository, the Settlement Notice 
Cut-Off Date and the Final Cancellation Date); and
(B) if such Viability Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Contingent Write-down will occur on the 
applicable Viability Event Write-down Date in accordance Condition 8 
(Contingent Write-down); or
(C) if such Viability Event occurs on or after the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Conversion will occur on the applicable 
Viability Event Conversion Date in accordance with Condition 9 
(Conversion).
10272857175-v14 93 70-41061831
(ii) A "Viability Event" will have occurred if prior to an Alternative Loss Absorption 
Date (if any):
(A) FINMA has notified UBS Group AG in writing that it has determined a 
conversion or write-down, as applicable, of holders' claims in respect of 
the Notes and all other capital instruments issued by, or other capital 
obligations (whether qualifying fully or partially for capital treatment) 
of, any member of the Group that, pursuant to their terms or by 
operation of law, are capable of being converted into equity or written 
down at that time, is, because customary measures to improve the 
Group Holding Company's capital adequacy are at the time inadequate 
or infeasible, an essential requirement to prevent the Group Holding 
Company from becoming insolvent, bankrupt, unable to pay a material 
part of its debts as they fall due or unable to carry on its business; or
(B) customary measures to improve the Group Holding Company's capital 
adequacy being at the time inadequate or infeasible, the Group Holding 
Company has received an irrevocable commitment of direct or indirect 
extraordinary support from the Public Sector (beyond customary 
transactions and arrangements in the ordinary course) that has, or 
imminently will have, the effect of improving the Group Holding 
Company's capital adequacy and without which, in the determination of 
(and as notified in writing by) FINMA, the Group Holding Company 
would have become insolvent, bankrupt, unable to pay a material part 
of its debts as they fall due or unable to carry on its business.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that a Viability Event may occur 
irrespective of whether or not a Trigger Event has occurred or whether any of 
the conditions to the issuance of a Trigger Event Notice have been met.
(d) Determination of CET1 Ratio and Trigger CET1 Ratio
With respect to any Publication Date, (i) the CET1 Ratio as of the relevant Balance Sheet 
Date, (ii) the Trigger CET1 Ratio as of such Publication Date and (iii) the components of 
both of the foregoing, in each case, as published on such Publication Date, will be final for 
purposes of this Condition 7, and any revisions, restatements or adjustments to any of the 
calculations described in subclauses (i) through (iii) of this clause (d) subsequently 
published will have no effect for purposes of this Condition 7.
(e) Alternative loss absorption
In the event of the implementation of any new, or amendment to or change in the 
interpretation of any existing, laws or components of National Regulations, in each case 
occurring after the Issue Date, that alone or together with any other law(s) or regulation(s) 
has, in the joint determination of UBS Group AG and FINMA, the effect that clause (c) 
of this Condition 7 could cease to apply to the Notes without giving rise to a Regulatory 
Event, then the Issuer shall give notice to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices) no later than five Business Days after such joint determination stating that such 
provisions will cease to apply from the date of such notice (the "Alternative Loss 
Absorption Date"), and from the date of such notice, such provisions will cease to apply 
to the Notes.
(f) Conversion Capital Availability Event
(i) A "Conversion Capital Availability Event" will have occurred on the first date 
after the Issue Date on which an amendment to the Articles of Association is 
registered in the main register (Hauptregister) of the Commercial Register 
(Handelsregister) of the Canton of Zurich as a result of which the Conversion 
Capital provided for in the Articles of Association meets or exceeds the Minimum
10272857175-v14 94 70-41061831
Conversion Capital Availability Amount. For purposes of these Terms and 
Conditions, a Conversion Capital Availability Event may occur only once.
For purposes of the definition of Conversion Capital Availability Event:
"Articles of Association" means, at any time, the articles of association (Statuten) 
of UBS Group AG in effect at such time.
"Minimum Conversion Capital Availability Amount" means, at any time, the 
amount of Conversion Capital that UBS Group AG would require in order for it 
to create and issue:
(A) the number of Ordinary Shares into which the Notes outstanding at such 
time would be converted if they were to be converted at the Conversion 
Price in effect at such time and otherwise in accordance with these Terms 
and Conditions; and
(B) if any Other Tier 1 Contingent Convertible Capital Notes are outstanding 
at such time, the number of Ordinary Shares into which such Other Tier 1 
Contingent Convertible Capital Notes would be converted if they were 
to be converted at the conversion price then in effect pursuant to, and 
otherwise in accordance with, their respective terms at such time,
in each case, out of such Conversion Capital.
"Other Tier 1 Contingent Convertible Capital Note" means a capital 
instrument (other than the Notes) that:
(A) is eligible in full to be (A) treated as Additional Tier 1 Capital and
(B) counted towards either the Going-Concern LR Requirement or the 
Going-Concern RWA Requirement (or both); and
(B) subject to the terms and conditions thereof, is to be:
(x) converted into Ordinary Shares; or
(y) after a Conversion Capital Availability Event (or equivalent 
event described in the terms and conditions thereof) occurs, 
converted into Ordinary Shares,
in either case, when the CET1 Ratio (or equivalent capital measure of the 
Group described in the terms and conditions thereof) falls below a certain 
threshold and/or a Viability Event (or equivalent event described in the 
terms and conditions thereof) occurs.
(ii) If a Conversion Capital Availability Event occurs at any time on or prior to a 
Trigger Event or a Viability Event, the Issuer shall as soon as practicable 
thereafter deliver to the Fiscal Agent and the Settlement Agent a certificate signed 
by the Authorised Signatories and notice to the Holders in accordance with 
Condition 15 (Notices), in each case stating that a Conversion Capital Availability 
Event has occurred and the date on which it occurred.
8. CONTINGENT WRITE-DOWN
If the Issuer has given a Trigger Event Write-down Notice or a Viability Event Write-down Notice 
in accordance with Condition 7 (Trigger Event and Viability Event), then on the relevant Writedown Date:
(a) the full principal amount of, and any accrued and unpaid interest (whether or not due and 
payable) on, each Note will automatically be written down to zero, the Notes will be 
cancelled and all references to the principal amount of the Notes in these Terms and 
Conditions will be construed accordingly;
10272857175-v14 95 70-41061831
(b) the Holders will be automatically deemed to have irrevocably waived their right to 
receive, and will no longer have any rights against the Issuer with respect to, repayment 
of the aggregate principal amount of, and payment of any accrued and unpaid interest on, 
the Notes written down pursuant to subclause (a) of this Condition 8 (bedingter 
Forderungsverzicht); and
(c) all rights of any Holder for payment of any amounts under or in respect of the Notes 
(including, without limitation, any amounts arising as a result of, or due and payable 
upon the occurrence of, an Event of Default) will become null and void, irrespective of 
whether such amounts have become due and payable prior to the date of the relevant 
Trigger Event Notice or Viability Event Notice, as the case may be, or the Write-down 
Date.
9. CONVERSION
(a) Conversion upon a Trigger Event or a Viability Event
If the Issuer has given a Trigger Event Conversion Notice or a Viability Event Conversion 
Notice in accordance with Condition 7 (Trigger Event and Viability Event), then:
(i) each Note shall, subject to and as provided in this Condition 9, be redeemed and 
settled (the "Conversion") on the applicable Conversion Date by (x) the delivery 
of new fully paid Ordinary Shares to the Settlement Share Depository on behalf 
of the Holders, and (y) the cancellation of any accrued and unpaid interest on the 
Notes (whether or not due and payable); and
(ii) receipt by the Settlement Share Depository of such number of Ordinary Shares as 
is required to satisfy in full its obligation to deliver Ordinary Shares in respect of 
the Conversion on the applicable Conversion Date shall be a good and complete 
discharge of the Issuer's (and, if UBS Group AG is not the Issuer, UBS Group 
AG's) obligations in respect of the Notes.
In the case of the Ordinary Shares to be delivered upon Conversion, as from the applicable 
Share Creation Date for such Ordinary Shares, there is no provision for the reconversion 
of such Ordinary Shares into Notes.
(b) Recourse for Ordinary Shares
Holders shall have recourse only to the Issuer for the issue and delivery of Ordinary Shares 
to the Settlement Share Depository pursuant to these Terms and Conditions. After such 
delivery to the Settlement Share Depository, Holders shall have recourse only to the 
Settlement Share Depository for the delivery to them of such Ordinary Shares or, in the 
circumstances described in clause (h) of this Condition 9, any cash amounts to which such 
Holders are entitled under clause (h) of this Condition 9.
(c) Conversion Price and determination of number of Ordinary Shares
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Conversion Event, as at the date on which the relevant 
Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice is 
published, each Holder shall be deemed to have accepted, and hereby accepts and 
agrees, (A) to the conversion of its holding of Notes into Ordinary Shares at the 
Conversion Price provided for herein and that, where necessary under Swiss law, 
the Settlement Agent shall effect such conversion on such Holder's behalf, and
(B) that its obligation to pay up the Ordinary Shares to be issued shall be set off 
against its claim for repayment of the principal amount upon redemption of the 
Notes, which claim shall be deemed to be due and payable immediately prior to 
the time on the Share Creation Date when, as a matter of Swiss law, the relevant 
Ordinary Shares are paid up. Such Ordinary Shares shall be paid up and issued on 
the Share Creation Date whereupon the Holders shall cease as a matter of Swiss 
law to be treated for all purposes under Swiss law as Holders and shall instead as 
of such date be treated for all purposes under Swiss law as Shareholders.
10272857175-v14 96 70-41061831
(ii) Subject to clause (g) of this Condition 9, the Issuer, with the assistance of the 
Settlement Agent, where necessary under Swiss law, shall issue and deliver to the 
Settlement Share Depository on the applicable Conversion Date such number of 
Ordinary Shares in respect of each Holder as is determined by the Settlement 
Agent by dividing the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by such Holder 
on the applicable Conversion Date by the Conversion Price in effect on the date 
of relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion 
Notice, as the case may be. The Settlement Agent shall determine such number 
of Ordinary Shares in accordance with this subclause (ii) as soon as practicable 
after publication of the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability 
Event Conversion Notice, as applicable.
(iii) The initial Conversion Price per Ordinary Share in respect of the Notes is 
specified in the definition thereof. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment 
to (and including) the date of the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or 
Viability Event Conversion Notice, as the case may be, in the circumstances 
described in clause (d) below.
(d) Anti-dilution adjustment of the Conversion Price
(i) Upon the occurrence of any of the events described below after 8 November 2023, 
the Conversion Price will be adjusted by the Issuer as follows:
(A) If there is a consolidation, reclassification, redesignation or subdivision 
in relation to the Ordinary Shares that alters the number of Ordinary 
Shares in issue, the Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the 
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such consolidation, 
reclassification, redesignation or subdivision by the following fraction:
where:
A is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately before such consolidation, reclassification, 
redesignation or subdivision, as the case may be; and
B is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately after, and as a result of, such consolidation, 
reclassification, redesignation or subdivision, as the case may 
be.
Such adjustment will become effective on the date on which the 
consolidation, reclassification, redesignation or subdivision, as the case 
may be, takes effect.
(B) If UBS Group AG issues any Ordinary Shares to Shareholders as a class 
credited as fully paid by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves 
(including any share premium account or capital redemption reserve) 
other than (x) where any such Ordinary Shares are or are to be issued 
instead of the whole or part of a Cash Distribution that the Shareholders 
would or could otherwise have elected to receive, (y) where the 
Shareholders may elect to receive a Cash Distribution in lieu of such 
Ordinary Shares or (z) where any such Ordinary Shares are or are 
expressed to be issued in lieu of a dividend (whether or not a Cash 
Distribution equivalent or amount is announced or would otherwise be 
payable to the Shareholders, whether at their election or otherwise), the 
Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price 
in force immediately prior to such issue by the following fraction:
10272857175-v14 97 70-41061831
where:
A is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately before such issue; and
B is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately after such issue.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of issue of such 
Ordinary Shares.
(C) If UBS Group AG makes or pays an Extraordinary Distribution to 
Shareholders, the Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the 
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the Effective Date by the 
following fraction:
where:
A is the Current Market Price of one Ordinary Share on the 
Effective Date (translated, if necessary, into the Relevant 
Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the Effective Date); and
B is the portion of the aggregate Extraordinary Distribution 
attributable to one Ordinary Share, with such portion being 
determined by dividing the aggregate Extraordinary 
Distribution by the number of Ordinary Shares entitled to 
receive the relevant Extraordinary Distribution. If the 
Extraordinary Distribution shall be expressed in a currency 
other than the Relevant Currency, it shall be converted into the 
Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the relevant 
Effective Date.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date.
For purposes of this subclause (C), "Effective Date" means (x) the first 
date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-the Extraordinary 
Distribution on the Relevant Stock Exchange or (y) if there is no 
Relevant Stock Exchange, the first date upon which the adjusted 
Conversion Price is capable of being determined in accordance with this 
subclause (C).
(D) If UBS Group AG issues Ordinary Shares to Shareholders as a class by 
way of rights or UBS Group AG or any other member of the Group or 
(at the direction or request or pursuant to arrangements with UBS Group 
AG or any other member of the Group) any other Person issues or grants 
to Shareholders as a class by way of rights, any options, warrants or other 
rights to subscribe for or purchase Ordinary Shares, or any Securities that 
by their terms of issue carry (directly or indirectly) rights of conversion 
into, or exchange or subscription for, any Ordinary Shares (or shall grant 
any such rights in respect of existing Securities so issued), in each case 
at a price per Ordinary Share that is less than 95 per cent. of the Current 
Market Price per Ordinary Share on the Effective Date (translated, if 
necessary, into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the 
Effective Date), the Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the 
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the Effective Date by the 
following fraction:
10272857175-v14 98 70-41061831
where:
A is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue on the Effective Date;
B is the number of Ordinary Shares that the aggregate 
consideration (if any) receivable for the Ordinary Shares issued 
by way of rights, or for the Securities issued by way of rights, 
or for the options or warrants or other rights issued by way of 
rights and for the total number of Ordinary Shares deliverable 
on the exercise thereof, would purchase at such Current Market 
Price per Ordinary Share on the Effective Date (translated, if 
necessary, into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on 
the Effective Date); and
C is the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or the maximum 
number of Ordinary Shares that may be issued upon exercise of 
such options, warrants or rights calculated as at the date of issue 
of such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion or 
exchange or exercise of rights of subscription or purchase in 
respect thereof at the initial conversion, exchange, subscription 
or purchase price or rate, as the case may be,
provided that, if on the Effective Date, such number of Ordinary Shares 
is to be determined by reference to the application of a formula or other 
variable feature or the occurrence of any event at some subsequent time, 
then for the purposes of this subclause (D), "C" will be determined by the 
application of such formula or variable feature or as if the relevant event 
occurs or had occurred as at the Effective Date and as if such conversion, 
exchange, subscription, purchase or acquisition had taken place on the 
Effective Date.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date.
For purposes of this subclause (D), "Effective Date" means (x) the first 
date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-rights, ex-options or exwarrants on the Relevant Stock Exchange or (y) if there is no Relevant 
Stock Exchange, the first date upon which the adjusted Conversion Price 
is capable of being determined in accordance with this subclause (D).
For purposes of any calculation of the consideration receivable or price 
pursuant to this subclause (D), the following provisions shall apply:
(1) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary 
Shares issued for cash shall be the amount of such cash;
(2) (x) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary 
Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the 
conversion or exchange of any Securities will be deemed to be 
the consideration or price received or receivable for any such 
Securities and (y) the aggregate consideration receivable or 
price for Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made 
available upon the exercise of rights of subscription attached to 
any Securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or 
rights will be deemed to be that part (which may be the whole) 
of the consideration or price received or receivable for such 
Securities or, as the case may be, for such options, warrants or 
rights that are attributed by UBS Group AG to such rights of 
subscription or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or 
rights or, if no part of such consideration or price is so attributed,
10272857175-v14 99 70-41061831
the Fair Market Value of such rights of subscription or, as the 
case may be, such options, warrants or rights as at the relevant 
Effective Date, plus in the case of each of subclauses (x) and (y) 
above, the additional minimum consideration receivable or price 
(if any) upon the conversion or exchange of such Securities, or 
upon the exercise of such rights or subscription attached thereto 
or, as the case may be, upon exercise of such options, warrants 
or rights, and (z) the consideration receivable or price per 
Ordinary Share upon the conversion or exchange of, or upon the 
exercise of such rights of subscription attached to, such 
Securities or, as the case may be, upon the exercise of such 
options, warrants or rights will be the aggregate consideration or 
price referred to in subclause (x) or (y) above (as the case may 
be) divided by the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued upon 
such conversion or exchange or exercise at the initial 
conversion, exchange or subscription price or rate;
(3) if the consideration or price determined pursuant to 
subclause (1) or (2) above (or any component thereof) is 
expressed in a currency other than the Relevant Currency, it shall 
be converted into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate 
on the relevant Effective Date (in the case of subclause (1) 
above) or the relevant date of first public announcement (in the 
case of subclause (2) above);
(4) in determining the consideration or price pursuant to the above, 
no deduction shall be made for any commissions or fees 
(howsoever described) or any expenses paid or incurred for any 
underwriting, placing or management of the issue of the relevant 
Ordinary Shares or Securities or options, warrants or rights, or 
otherwise in connection therewith; and
(5) the consideration or price shall be determined as provided above 
on the basis of the consideration or price received, receivable, 
paid or payable, regardless of whether all or part thereof is 
received, receivable, paid or payable by or to UBS Group AG or 
another entity.
(E) If UBS Group AG determines, in its sole discretion, that, notwithstanding 
subclauses (A) to (D) of this Condition 9(d)(i), a reduction to the 
Conversion Price should be made as a result of one or more events or 
circumstances not referred to in this Condition 9(d)(i) that would require 
an adjustment to the Conversion Price in order to comply with Swiss 
mandatory law on the protection of holders of instruments that may 
convert into shares issued out of capital range (Kapitalband), conditional 
capital (bedingtes Kapital) or Conversion Capital, the Conversion Price 
will be reduced (either generally or for a specified period) in such manner 
and with effect from such date as UBS Group AG shall determine and 
the Issuer shall notify to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices).
(ii) Notwithstanding Condition 9(d)(i):
(A) where
(1) the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment to the 
Conversion Price have resulted or will result in an adjustment to 
the Conversion Price; or
(2) more than one event that gives rise to an adjustment to the 
Conversion Price occurs within such a short period of time,
10272857175-v14 100 70-41061831
that, in the opinion of UBS Group AG, a modification to the 
operation of the adjustment provisions set forth in this Condition 
9(d) is required to give the intended result, such modification 
will be made to the operation of the adjustment provisions set 
forth in this Condition 9(d) as may be determined by an 
Independent Adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to give the 
intended result, including to ensure that (x) an adjustment to the 
Conversion Price or the economic effect thereof shall not be 
taken into account more than once, (y) the economic effect of an 
Extraordinary Distribution is not taken into account more than 
once, and (z) to reflect a redenomination of the issued Ordinary 
Shares for the time being into a new currency;
(B) any adjustment to the Conversion Price will be subject to such 
Conversion Price not being less than the par value of an Ordinary Share 
at such time (currently USD 0.10);
(C) UBS Group AG shall not take any action, and shall procure that no action 
is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Conversion 
Price to below the par value of an Ordinary Share then in effect;
(D) if any doubt arises as to whether an adjustment is to be made to the 
Conversion Price or as to the appropriate adjustment to the Conversion 
Price, UBS Group AG may in its sole discretion appoint an Independent 
Adviser and, following consultation between UBS Group AG and such 
Independent Adviser, a written opinion of such Independent Adviser in 
respect thereof will (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith and 
manifest error) be conclusive and binding on UBS Group AG and the 
Holders;
(E) no adjustment will be made to the Conversion Price where Ordinary 
Shares or other securities (including rights, warrants and options) are 
issued, offered, exercised, allotted, purchased, appropriated, modified or 
granted to, or for the benefit of, employees or former employees 
(including directors holding or formerly holding executive office or the 
personal service company of any such person) or their spouses or 
relatives, in each case, of UBS Group AG or any of its subsidiaries or 
any associated company or to a trustee or trustees to be held for the 
benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to any share or 
option scheme; and
(F) on any adjustment, if the resultant Conversion Price has more decimal 
places than the initial Conversion Price, it will be rounded to the same 
number of decimal places as the initial Conversion Price. No adjustment 
will be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded 
down if applicable) would be less than one per cent. of the Conversion 
Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any 
amount by which the Conversion Price has been rounded down, will be 
carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and 
such subsequent adjustment will be made on the basis that the adjustment 
not required to be made had been made at the relevant time and/or that 
the relevant rounding down had not been made, as the case may be.
(iii) The Issuer shall give notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price made 
pursuant to this Condition 9(d) to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices) promptly after the determination thereof.
(iv) References in these Terms and Conditions to any issue or offer or grant to 
Shareholders "as a class" or "by way of rights" shall be taken to be references to 
an issue or offer or grant to all or substantially all Shareholders, other than 
Shareholders to whom, by reason of the laws of any territory or requirements of 
any recognised regulatory body or any other stock exchange or securities market
10272857175-v14 101 70-41061831
in any territory or in connection with fractional entitlements, it is determined not 
to make such issue or offer or grant.
(e) Qualifying Relevant Event
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Relevant Event that is a Qualifying Relevant Event, 
then:
(A) upon the occurrence of a Conversion Event where the applicable 
Conversion Date falls on or after the New Conversion Condition 
Effective Date,
(1) the Notes shall be converted on such Conversion Date into, or 
be exchanged on such Conversion Date for, as the case may be, 
Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity, mutatis mutandis as 
provided in accordance with this Condition 9, at a Conversion 
Price that shall be the New Conversion Price; and
(2) the Issuer shall procure the issue and/or delivery of the relevant 
number of Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity in the manner 
provided in this Condition 9 (as may be amended as described 
in the definition of the term New Conversion Condition); and
(B) the New Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment in the 
circumstances provided in this Condition 9 for the adjustment of the 
Conversion Price (if necessary with such amendments as an Independent 
Adviser shall determine to be appropriate) and the Issuer shall give notice 
in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) to the Holders of the New 
Conversion Price and of any such amendments thereafter.
(ii) Upon the occurrence of a Relevant Event, the Issuer shall give notice thereof to 
the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) within 10 Business Days 
following the occurrence of such Relevant Event, which notice shall:
(A) specify the identity of the Acquiror;
(B) specify whether the Relevant Event is a Qualifying Relevant Event or a 
Non-Qualifying Relevant Event;
(C) in the case of a Qualifying Relevant Event, specify the New Conversion 
Price; and
(D) if applicable, specify the New Conversion Condition Effective Date.
(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, upon the occurrence of a Relevant Event that is a 
Non-Qualifying Relevant Event, the provisions of this clause (e) shall (subject to 
the subsequent operation of this clause (e) upon the occurrence of a subsequent 
Relevant Event) not apply, and the Notes will continue to be convertible into 
Ordinary Shares pursuant to and in accordance with the other provisions of this 
Condition 9 (Conversion), if and when the Issuer gives a Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice or a Viability Event Conversion Notice in accordance with 
Condition 7 (Trigger Event and Viability Event).
(iv) For purposes of these Terms and Conditions:
"Acquiror" means the Person (including a Governmental Entity) that, following 
a Relevant Event, controls UBS Group AG.
"Approved Entity" means an Acquiror that is body corporate that is 
incorporated or established under the laws of an OECD member state and that, 
on the occurrence of the Relevant Event, has in issue Relevant Shares.
10272857175-v14 102 70-41061831
"Governmental Entity" means (x) the Swiss Confederation, (y) an agency of the 
Swiss Confederation or (z) a person or entity (other than a body corporate) 
controlled by the Swiss Confederation or any such agency referred to in clause (y); 
provided, however, that, if UBS Group AG is at any time organised in a 
jurisdiction outside of Switzerland, references in this definition to "the Swiss 
Confederation" shall be read as references to the government of such other 
jurisdiction.
The "New Conversion Condition" shall be satisfied in respect of a Relevant 
Event if, by no later than seven days following the occurrence of such Relevant 
Event, (x) UBS Group AG has, to the satisfaction of UBS Group AG, entered into 
arrangements with the Approved Entity that provide for delivery of Relevant 
Shares of the Approved Entity on Conversion on terms mutatis mutandis as 
provided in the provisions of this Condition 9, and (y) the Issuer has entered into 
such agreements and arrangements, and made such amendments to these Terms 
and Conditions, as may be required to ensure that, with effect from the New 
Conversion Condition Effective Date, the Notes shall, following the occurrence of 
a Conversion Event, be convertible into, or exchangeable for, Relevant Shares of 
the Approved Entity, mutatis mutandis in accordance with, and subject to, this 
Condition 9 (as may be so amended) at the New Conversion Price; provided, 
however, that, any failure to enter into the arrangements and agreements and/or 
make the amendments described in clauses (x) and (y) shall not constitute a 
default or an Event of Default under these Terms and Conditions.
"New Conversion Condition Effective Date" means the date with effect from 
which the New Conversion Condition has been satisfied.
"New Conversion Price" means, in respect of any Conversion Date falling on or 
after the New Conversion Condition Effective Date, the amount determined by the 
Issuer in accordance with the following formula:
where:
NCP is the New Conversion Price.
ECP is the Conversion Price in effect on the last dealing day prior 
to the New Conversion Condition Effective Date.
VWAPRS is the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the 
Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity (translated, if 
necessary, into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate 
on the relevant dealing day) on each of the five dealing days 
ending on the last dealing day prior to the date on which the 
Relevant Event occurred (and where references in the 
definition of "Volume Weighted Average Price" to 
"Ordinary Shares" shall be construed as a reference to the 
Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity and in the definition 
of "dealing day", references to the "Relevant Stock 
Exchange" shall be to the primary Recognised Stock 
Exchange on which the Relevant Shares of the Approved 
Entity are then listed, admitted to trading or accepted for 
dealing).
VWAPOS is the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the 
Ordinary Shares (translated, if necessary, into the Relevant 
Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the relevant dealing day) 
on each of the five dealing days ending on
10272857175-v14 103 70-41061831
the last dealing day prior to the date on which the Relevant 
Event occurred.
"Non-Qualifying Relevant Event" means a Relevant Event that is not a 
Qualifying Relevant Event.
"Qualifying Relevant Event" means a Relevant Event where:
(A) the Acquiror is an Approved Entity; and
(B) the New Conversion Condition is satisfied.
A "Relevant Event" will have occurred if, on or after the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, any Person or Persons acting in concert 
acquires control of UBS Group AG (other than as a result of an Exempt 
Reorganisation). For the purposes of this definition "Relevant Event", "control" 
means the acquisition or holding of legal or beneficial ownership of more than 95 
per cent. of the issued Ordinary Shares of UBS Group AG (whether obtained 
directly or indirectly and whether obtained by ownership of share capital, contract 
or otherwise) and, as a consequence thereof, the Ordinary Shares are no longer 
admitted to trading on any Recognised Stock Exchange, and "controlled" shall be 
construed accordingly.
"Relevant Shares" means, in respect of an Acquiror, ordinary share capital of 
such Acquiror that constitutes equity share capital or the equivalent (or depositary 
or other receipts representing the same) that is listed and admitted to trading on a 
Recognised Stock Exchange.
(f) Procedure for settlement and delivery of Ordinary Shares on Conversion
Ordinary Shares to be issued on Conversion shall be delivered subject to and as provided 
below.
(g) Fractions
Fractions of Ordinary Shares will not be issued or delivered pursuant to these Terms and 
Conditions on Conversion and no cash payment will be made in lieu thereof. The number 
of Ordinary Shares to be issued and delivered to the Settlement Share Depository for the 
benefit of each Holder in respect of a Conversion shall be calculated by the Settlement 
Agent on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by such Holder on the 
applicable Conversion Date and rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number 
of Ordinary Shares.
(h) Procedure for delivery in respect of a Conversion
(i) UBS Group AG, with the assistance of the Settlement Agent where necessary 
under Swiss law, shall on or prior to the applicable Conversion Date issue and 
deliver to the Settlement Share Depository such number of Ordinary Shares as is 
required to satisfy in full its obligation to deliver Ordinary Shares to the Holders 
in respect of the Conversion on the applicable Conversion Date. Receipt by the 
Settlement Share Depository of such Ordinary Shares shall be a good and 
complete discharge of the Issuer's (and, if UBS Group AG is not the Issuer, UBS 
Group AG's) obligations in respect of the Notes. If the Issuer is unable to appoint 
a Settlement Share Depository on or prior to the giving of the Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice, as the case may be, it 
shall make such other arrangements for the issuance and delivery of the Ordinary 
Shares to be issued and delivered upon Conversion to the Holders as it considers, 
in its sole discretion, to be reasonable in the circumstances, which may include 
issuing and delivering such Ordinary Shares to another independent nominee to 
be held on trust for the Holders or issuing and delivering such Ordinary Shares to 
the Holders directly, which issuance and delivery shall irrevocably discharge and 
satisfy all of the Issuer's obligations under the Notes as if the relevant Ordinary
10272857175-v14 104 70-41061831
Shares had been issued and delivered to the Settlement Share Depository and, in 
which case, where the context so admits, references in these Terms and 
Conditions to the issue and delivery of Ordinary Shares to the Settlement Share 
Depository shall be construed accordingly and apply mutatis mutandis.
(ii) Subject to the making of a Settlement Shares Offer and as otherwise provided 
herein, the Settlement Agent shall give instructions to the Settlement Share 
Depository for the relevant Ordinary Shares to be delivered by the Settlement 
Share Depository on the applicable Settlement Date to the Holders, and the 
Settlement Share Depository shall procure that the Ordinary Shares are so 
delivered to the Holders on the applicable Settlement Date.
(iii) In respect of a Conversion as a result of the occurrence of a Trigger Event only, 
following receipt by the Settlement Share Depository of the Ordinary Shares and 
the resulting good and complete discharge of the Issuer's obligations in respect of 
the Notes as described in subclause (i) above, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, 
appoint a placement agent (the "Settlement Shares Offer Agent") acting on 
behalf, and for the accounts, of the Holders to conduct an offering of the Ordinary 
Shares to which the Holders are otherwise entitled (a "Settlement Shares 
Offer"). In the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice, the Issuer shall notify 
the Holders whether it will appoint such Settlement Shares Offer Agent to conduct 
such a Settlement Shares Offer. If it does so appoint a Settlement Shares Offer 
Agent, it will instruct the Settlement Share Depository to deliver the relevant 
Ordinary Shares to or to the order of the Settlement Shares Offer Agent for this 
purpose prior to the end of the Offer Settlement Period. Such Settlement Shares 
Offer shall be made (x) at a net price per Ordinary Share, which, translated into 
the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate at the date of the Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice, is equal to the Conversion Price in effect on the date of the 
Trigger Event Conversion Notice, and (y) to some or, subject to applicable laws 
and regulations and to such an offer being practicable in the opinion of the Issuer 
in the Offer Settlement Period, all Shareholders on the record date of the Trigger 
Event Conversion Notice then eligible to participate in such offer. Any such 
Settlement Shares Offer shall be completed no later than 20 Business Days after 
the occurrence of the Trigger Event (the "Offer Settlement Period"). Neither the 
Issuer nor the Settlement Share Depository shall incur any liability whatsoever to 
the Holders in respect of the appointment of such Settlement Shares Offer Agent 
or its conduct, save for cases of gross negligence or wilful intent.
If the Settlement Shares Offer is fully subscribed by or before the end of the Offer 
Settlement Period, Holders shall, pursuant to the agreement appointing the 
Settlement Shares Offer Agent, be entitled to receive from the Settlement Shares 
Offer Agent on the fifth Business Day after the end of the Offer Settlement Period, 
in respect of each Ordinary Share to which they were otherwise entitled, cash 
proceeds received from the Settlement Shares Offer in an amount equal to the 
Conversion Price in effect on the date of the Trigger Event Conversion Notice 
(translated, if necessary, into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate at the 
date of the Trigger Event Conversion Notice). If the Settlement Shares Offer is 
only partially subscribed by the end of the Offer Settlement Period, Holders shall 
in aggregate be entitled to receive on a pro rata basis (x) cash proceeds received 
from such Settlement Shares Offer in an amount equal to the Conversion Price in 
effect on the date of the Trigger Event Conversion Notice (translated, if necessary, 
into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate at the date of the Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice) multiplied by the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares sold 
on the fifth Business Day after the end of the Offer Settlement Period from the 
Settlement Shares Offer Agent, pursuant to the agreement appointing the 
Settlement Shares Offer Agent, and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest 
sub-unit of the Relevant Currency (one half of any such sub-unit being rounded 
upwards), together with (y) the number of Ordinary Shares not subscribed 
pursuant to the Settlement Shares Offer within the period specified below from the 
Settlement Share Depository. If no Ordinary Shares are subscribed in the 
Settlement Shares Offer, Holders shall be entitled to receive the relevant Ordinary
10272857175-v14 105 70-41061831
Shares within the period specified below from the Settlement Share Depository. 
Notwithstanding Condition 10 (Payments; Agents), any cash proceeds that the 
Holders are entitled to receive pursuant to this subclause (iii) shall be delivered to 
the Holders in accordance with clause (j) of this Condition 9.
In relation to any Ordinary Shares not sold pursuant to a Settlement Shares Offer, 
the Settlement Agent shall give instructions to the Settlement Shares Offer Agent 
for such Ordinary Shares to be delivered by the Settlement Shares Offer Agent to 
the relevant Holders within five Business Days after the end of the Offer 
Settlement Period.
(i) Taxes and duties
None of the Issuer, any other member of the Group, any Agent, the Settlement Share 
Depository and the US Transfer Agent will pay any capital, stamp, issue, registration, 
transfer or other taxes or duties arising upon Conversion or that may arise or be paid as a 
consequence of or in connection with the issue and delivery of Ordinary Shares to the 
Settlement Share Depository or the delivery of any Ordinary Shares to the relevant 
recipient in accordance with the instructions given in the relevant Settlement Shares 
Settlement Notice. A Holder must pay any capital, stamp, issue, registration, transfer or 
other taxes or duties arising upon Conversion or that may arise or be paid as a consequence 
of or in connection with the issue and delivery of the Ordinary Shares to the Settlement 
Share Depository or the delivery of the Ordinary Shares to the relevant recipient in 
accordance with the instructions given in the relevant Settlement Shares Settlement 
Notice, and such Holder must pay all, if any, such taxes and duties arising by reference to 
any disposal or deemed disposal of such Holder's Notes or interest therein. Any capital, 
stamp, issue, registration, transfer or other taxes or duties arising on delivery or transfer 
of Ordinary Shares to a purchaser in any Settlement Shares Offer shall be payable by the 
relevant purchaser of those Ordinary Shares.
(j) Delivery of Ordinary Shares and cash proceeds received from a Settlement Shares Offer
UBS Group AG, with the assistance of the Settlement Agent where necessary under Swiss 
law, will issue and deliver the Ordinary Shares required to be issued and delivered on 
Conversion to the Settlement Share Depository on behalf of the Holder of the relevant 
Note(s). The Issuer (or another party so authorised by the Issuer) shall instruct the US 
Transfer Agent to credit such Ordinary Shares to a nominee account in the name of the 
Settlement Share Depository to be held on behalf of the Holders on the applicable 
Conversion Date. Receipt by the Settlement Share Depository of such Ordinary Shares on 
the applicable Conversion Date shall be a good and complete discharge of the Issuer's 
obligations in respect of the Notes as described in subclause (h)(i) of this Condition 9.
In order to obtain delivery from the Settlement Share Depository of the Ordinary Shares 
and/or cash proceeds received from a Settlement Shares Offer, in each case to which it is 
entitled pursuant to this Condition 9, a Holder will be required to deliver to the Settlement 
Share Depository (or any of its agent designated for such purpose in the Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice, as applicable) an executed 
settlement shares settlement notice substantially in the form that may be obtained from the 
Specified Office of the Settlement Agent (a "Settlement Shares Settlement Notice") and 
the relevant Certificate representing the relevant Note to the Settlement Share Depository 
(or any of its agents designated for such purpose in the Trigger Event Conversion Notice 
or Viability Event Conversion Notice) on or before the Settlement Notice Cut-off Date. If 
such Settlement Shares Settlement Notice or Certificate is delivered after the end of 
normal business hours at the Specified Office of the Settlement Share Depository, such 
delivery shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made or given on the following 
New York Business Day. The Settlement Shares Settlement Notice must contain certain 
information, including the name of the relevant recipient in which the relevant Ordinary 
Shares are to be registered directly on the books of the US Transfer, and Settlement Shares 
Settlement Notices and Certificates must be delivered to the Settlement Share Depository 
(or any of its agents designated for such purpose in the Trigger Event Conversion Notice 
or Viability Event Conversion Notice, as applicable) in accordance with the procedures
10272857175-v14 106 70-41061831
described in the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion 
Notice, as applicable; provided, however, that, if the Notes are represented by one or more 
Global Certificates deposited with, or with a custodian for, the Depositary, then the 
Settlement Shares Settlement Notice must be given in accordance with the standard 
procedures of the Depositary (which may include, without limitation, delivery of the 
notice to the Settlement Share Depository by electronic means) and in a form acceptable 
to the Depositary, the Settlement Agent and the Settlement Share Depository. Subject as 
otherwise provided herein, the relevant Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds of a 
Settlement Shares Offer will be delivered by or on behalf of the Settlement Share 
Depository or the Settlement Shares Offer Agent, as applicable, in accordance with the 
instructions given in the relevant Settlement Shares Settlement Notice; provided, however, 
that, if the Notes are represented by one or more Global Certificates deposited with, or 
with a custodian for, the Depositary, then delivery of any such cash proceeds shall be made 
by the Settlement Shares Offer Agent in accordance with the Depositary's practices from 
time to time.
If a Holder delivers a valid Settlement Shares Settlement Notice and the relevant 
Certificate on or before the Settlement Notice Cut-off Date, then the Ordinary Shares will 
be delivered in respect of the relevant Note(s) by way of registering the Ordinary Shares in 
the name of the relevant recipient directly on the books of the US Transfer Agent on the 
applicable Settlement Date or such other date as is specified for delivery. Once Ordinary 
Shares are registered in the name of the relevant recipient directly on the books of the US 
Transfer Agent, such relevant recipient, as Shareholder, is expected to receive periodic 
account statements from the US Transfer Agent with respect to its Ordinary Shares. At the 
time of delivery of any Ordinary Shares to the relevant recipient by registration of such 
Ordinary Shares directly on the books of the US Transfer Agent, the then-valid share 
registration rules of UBS Group AG will apply, and UBS Group AG does not offer any 
assurance or guarantee that such relevant recipient will be accepted as a Shareholder with 
voting rights in the share register of UBS Group AG.
If a Holder fails to deliver a Settlement Shares Settlement Notice or the relevant Certificate 
on or before the Settlement Notice Cut-off Date or if a Holder has delivered a Settlement 
Shares Settlement Notice and the relevant Certificate on or prior the Settlement Notice 
Cut-off Date but such Settlement Shares Settlement Notice has been determined by the 
Settlement Share Depository to be null and void, then the Settlement Share Depository 
shall continue to hold the relevant Ordinary Shares and/or, as applicable, cash proceeds 
received from a Settlement Shares Offer, in each case to which such Holder is entitled 
pursuant to this Condition 9, until a valid Settlement Shares Settlement Notice (and the 
Certificate representing the relevant Notes) is so delivered by such Holder. If any such 
Ordinary Shares or such cash proceeds received from a Settlement Shares Offer (as 
applicable) have not been claimed during the 10-year and 30-day period commencing on 
the Final Cancellation Date, the relevant claims of the applicable Holders are time-barred 
and the relevant Ordinary Shares and cash, as the case may be, will be transferred to the 
Issuer. None of the Issuer, the Settlement Share Depository and the Settlement Shares 
Offer Agent shall have any liability to any Holder for any loss resulting from such Holder 
not receiving any such Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds.
If not previously cancelled on the applicable Settlement Date, the relevant Notes shall be 
cancelled on the Final Cancellation Date and any Holder delivering a Settlement Shares 
Settlement Notice after the Settlement Notice Cut-off Date will have to provide evidence 
of its entitlement to the relevant Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds from a Settlement 
Shares Offer, as applicable, satisfactory to the Settlement Share Depository in its sole 
discretion in order to receive delivery of such Ordinary Shares or such cash proceeds, as 
applicable. None of the Issuer, the Settlement Share Depository and the Settlement Shares 
Offer Agent shall have any liability to any Holder for any loss resulting from such Holder 
not receiving any Ordinary Shares or cash proceeds from a Settlement Shares Offer, as 
applicable, or from any delay in the receipt thereof, in each case as a result of such Holder 
failing to submit a valid Settlement Shares Settlement Notice and any relevant Certificate 
(if applicable), on a timely basis or at all.
10272857175-v14 107 70-41061831
Any determination as to whether any Settlement Shares Settlement Notice has been 
properly completed and delivered together with the relevant Certificate(s) as provided in 
these Terms and Conditions, or whether any evidence of entitlement to Ordinary Shares or 
cash proceeds received from a Settlement Shares Offer, as applicable, is satisfactory, shall 
be made by the Settlement Share Depository in its sole discretion and shall be conclusive 
and binding on the relevant Holders. In the case of Notes represented by a Global 
Certificate, any Settlement Shares Settlement Notice delivered prior to the day following 
the Suspension Date will be null and void.
(k) Ordinary Shares
The Ordinary Shares issued and delivered on Conversion will be fully paid and nonassessable and will in all respects rank pari passu with the fully paid Ordinary Shares in 
issue on the relevant Share Creation Date, except in any such case for any right excluded 
by mandatory provisions of applicable law, and except that the Ordinary Shares so issued 
and delivered will not rank for (or, as the case may be, the relevant Holder will not be 
entitled to receive) any rights, distributions or payments the record date or other due date 
for the establishment of entitlement for which falls prior to the relevant Share Creation 
Date.
All Ordinary Shares issued and delivered to Holders upon Conversion are expected to be 
"restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the US Securities Act, and 
accordingly, any Holder who receives Ordinary Shares upon Conversion will be subject 
to restrictions under the US Securities Act on its ability to resell such Ordinary Shares. 
Subject to applicable law and the policies and procedures of the US Transfer Agent from 
time to time, through the US Transfer Agent, Holders who receive Ordinary Shares upon 
Conversion are expected to be able to effect transfers of such Ordinary Shares with other 
Shareholders holding their Ordinary Shares through the US Transfer Agent, or with 
Shareholders holding their Ordinary Shares via DTC through custodian banks or brokers 
by means of DTC's Direct Registration System.
(l) Purchase or redemption of Ordinary Shares
UBS Group AG or any of its subsidiaries may exercise such rights as it may from time to 
time enjoy to purchase or redeem or buy back any shares or securities of UBS Group AG 
(including Ordinary Shares) or any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing 
the same without the consent of Holders.
(m) Determinations to be made by an Independent Adviser
In the case of any determination that is required to be made by an Independent Adviser 
under these Terms and Conditions, the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint 
an Independent Adviser to make such determination; provided, however, that, 
notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions, if the Issuer is unable 
to so appoint an Independent Adviser or the Independent Adviser so appointed by the 
Issuer fails to make such determination, the Issuer, acting in good faith and a commercially 
reasonable manner, will make such determination.
Any determination that is made by an Independent Adviser under these Terms and 
Conditions will be made in the sole discretion of such Independent Adviser acting in good 
faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
(n) Notifications, etc. to be final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and 
decisions given, expressed, made or obtained by an Independent Adviser or the Settlement 
Agent for purposes of this Condition 9 will (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith and 
manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Agents and the Holders and (in the absence 
of wilful default and bad faith) no liability to the Issuer or the Holders will attach to the 
Independent Adviser or the Settlement Agent in connection with the exercise or non-
10272857175-v14 108 70-41061831
exercise by the Independent Adviser or the Settlement Agent of its powers, duties and 
discretions under this Condition 9.
10. PAYMENTS; AGENTS
(a) All payments required to be made under the Notes will be made available in good time 
in freely disposable funds in USD, which will be placed at the free disposal of the Fiscal 
Agent on behalf of the Holders. If the Scheduled Due Date for any payment (whether in 
respect of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of the Notes is not a Payment 
Business Day, then the Holders will not be entitled to payment thereof until the first 
Payment Business Day following the Scheduled Due Date, and the Holders will not be 
entitled to any additional sum in relation to such payment. All payments required to be 
made under the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Additional Amounts) 
shall be made to the Holders in USD without collection costs, without any restrictions 
and whatever the circumstances may be, irrespective of nationality, domicile or 
residence of the relevant Holder and without certification, affidavit or the fulfilment of 
any other formality; provided, however, that, in the case of Notes represented by 
Definitive Certificates, such Definitive Certificates must be presented and, in the case of 
redemption, surrendered at the Specified Office of the relevant Paying Agent as a 
condition to receipt of any such payment.
(b) The receipt by the Fiscal Agent of the due and punctual payment of funds in USD will 
release the Issuer from its obligations under the Notes to the extent of such payment.
Subject to clause (d) of this Condition 10:
(i) the Issuer reserves the right to terminate the appointment of any Agent, as well as 
to appoint or, after any such appointment, to terminate the appointment of, one or 
more other paying agents to carry out any payment, calculation or other functions 
in respect of the Notes (each, a "Paying Agent"), provided that (A) so long as any 
Note is outstanding, there will at all times be a Fiscal Agent, a Registrar, a 
Calculation Agent and a Settlement Agent, (B) for so long as the Notes are listed 
on the SIX Swiss Exchange and if then required by the regulations of the SIX 
Swiss Exchange, the Issuer shall maintain a Paying Agent in Switzerland, which 
agent shall have an office in Switzerland and be a bank or securities dealer subject 
to supervision by FINMA, to perform the functions of a Swiss paying agent (the 
"Swiss Paying Agent"), and (C) any successor Calculation Agent must be a 
leading bank or financial institution that is experienced in the calculations and 
determinations to be made by the Calculation Agent; and
(ii) if at any time the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar, the Calculation Agent, or the Swiss 
Paying Agent, (A) becomes incapable of acting, or (B) is adjudged bankrupt or 
insolvent, or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or makes an assignment for 
the benefit of its creditors, or consents to the appointment of a receiver of all or 
any substantial part of its property, or admits in writing its inability to pay or meet 
its debts as they mature, or if an order of any court is entered approving any 
petition filed by or against it under the provisions of any applicable bankruptcy 
or insolvency law, or if a receiver of it or of all or any substantial part of its 
property is appointed, or if any public officer takes charge or control of it or of its 
property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation 
(any such event, an "Agent Insolvency Event"), then the Issuer will terminate 
the appointment of such Agent in accordance with the Fiscal Agency Agreement 
and appoint a successor Agent; and
(iii) if at any time the Calculation Agent fails to (A) determine the Treasury Yield or 
the Reset Interest Rate or duly calculate the Reset Interest Amount for any Reset 
Interest Period or the interest amount payable on the Redemption Date (if the 
Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to Condition 6 (Redemption and Purchase)) 
or (B) comply with any other requirement in relation to the Notes, then the Issuer 
will terminate the appointment of the Calculation Agent in accordance with the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement and appoint a successor Calculation Agent; provided,
10272857175-v14 109 70-41061831
however, that, if the Calculation Agent duly calculates such Reset Interest Rate, 
Reset Interest Amount or interest amount payable on the Redemption Date, as 
the case may be, prior to its termination (and the appointment of its successor) 
taking effect in accordance with clause (d) of this Condition 10, the Issuer may 
elect, in its sole discretion and upon notice to the Holders in accordance with 
Condition 15 (Notices), to cancel such termination (and appointment).
(c) Any appointment or termination of appointment of, or any resignation by, any Agent 
(other than the Settlement Agent) may only take effect not more than 45 and not less than 
30 days after the Issuer has notified the Holders of such appointment, termination or 
resignation in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices); provided, however, that, in the case 
of the termination of an Agent with respect to which an Agent Insolvency Event has 
occurred, such termination may take effect prior to the expiry of such 30-day notice period, 
so long as a successor Agent has been appointed to the extent required by the immediately 
succeeding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any termination of the appointment 
of, or resignation by, the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar, the Swiss Paying Agent or the 
Calculation Agent may not take effect until the Issuer has appointed a successor Fiscal 
Agent, Registrar, Swiss Paying Agent or Calculation Agent, as applicable; provided, 
however, that, if no such successor has been appointed within 30 days of the scheduled 
effectiveness of such termination or resignation, any Holder (on behalf of itself and all 
others similarly situated) or, pursuant to and in accordance with the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement, the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar, any Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, 
as the case may be, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment 
of a successor, at the expense of the Issuer.
(d) Subject to subclause (c)(i) of this Condition 10, the Issuer may appoint or terminate the 
appointment of a Settlement Agent, and a Settlement Agent may resign, at any time. The 
Issuer will notify the Holders of any such appointment, termination or resignation in 
accordance with Condition 15 (Notices).
11. TAXATION
(a) All payments to be made by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Notes (including, 
for the avoidance of doubt, payments by a Paying Agent) shall be made without 
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, 
assessments or other government charges of any nature ("Taxes") imposed, levied, 
collected, withheld or assessed by or on behalf of any Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof or any authority of or in a Tax Jurisdiction or any political subdivision 
thereof having the power to impose, levy, collect, withhold or assess Taxes, unless 
withholding, deduction or accounting for such Taxes is required by law.
(b) In the event that any payment to be made by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the 
Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payments by a Paying Agent) is subject to 
any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes by requirement of law in a 
Tax Jurisdiction (as determined by the relevant tax authority of or in such Tax 
Jurisdiction), the Issuer shall pay such additional amounts as will result in the Holders 
receiving the amounts that they would have received in respect of the Notes if no such 
withholding or deduction had been required ("Additional Amounts").
(c) No Additional Amounts will be payable pursuant to clause (b) of this Condition 11 in 
relation to any Note:
(i) if the relevant Holder is liable for such Taxes on such Note as a result of having 
some connection with the relevant Tax Jurisdiction other than its mere ownership 
or possession of such Note or the receipt of principal or interest in respect thereof; 
or
(ii) if such Taxes are a result of such Note having been presented for payment (where 
presentment is required) more than 30 days after the Relevant Date, except to the 
extent that the Holder would have been entitled to receive the Additional Amounts 
if it had presented such Note for payment on the last day of the 30-day period; or
10272857175-v14 110 70-41061831
(iii) with respect to any Tax collected pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the 
US Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"), the regulations 
promulgated thereunder, or applicable inter-governmental agreements or 
agreements with the United States Internal Revenue Service entered into in 
connection with the implementation of such sections of the Code, or legislation 
enacted by a non-United States jurisdiction in connection with the implementation 
of such sections of the Code (FATCA); or]
(iv) where such withholding or deduction is required to be made pursuant to laws 
enacted by Switzerland providing for the taxation of payments according to 
principles similar to those laid down in the draft legislation of the Swiss Federal 
Council of 3 April 2020, or otherwise changing the Swiss federal withholding tax 
system from an issuer-based system to a paying agent-based system pursuant to 
which a Person other than the issuer is required to withhold tax on any interest 
payments; or
(v) to the extent any combination of subclauses (i) through (iv) of this clause (c) 
applies.
(d) Any reference in these Terms and Conditions to amounts payable by the Issuer in respect 
of the Notes includes (i) any Additional Amount payable pursuant to this Condition 11 
and (ii) any sum payable pursuant to an obligation taken in addition to or in substitution 
for the obligation in this Condition 11.

become time-barred after the 10-year period, in each case, commencing on the date on which such 
payments, repayment or redemption become due and payable.
13. EVENTS OF DEFAULT
(a) If any of the following events occurs, such occurrence will constitute an "Event of 
Default":
(i) the Issuer fails to pay the principal amount of any Note if and when the same 
becomes due and payable under these Terms and Conditions, and such failure 
continues unremedied for a period of 30 days; or
(ii) the Issuer fails to pay any interest on the Notes if and when the same becomes 
due and payable under these Terms and Conditions, and such failure continues 
unremedied for a period of 30 days; or
(iii) the Issuer fails to observe or perform any other covenant, condition, or agreement 
contained in these Terms and Conditions, and such failure continues unremedied 
for a period of 60 days after written notice thereof from any Holder to the Issuer; 
or
(iv) a Bankruptcy Event;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding subclauses (i) to (iv) above, neither (A) the 
opening of Restructuring Proceedings with respect to the Issuer nor (B) the exercise of 
any Swiss Resolution Power with respect to the Issuer during any such Restructuring 
Proceedings nor (C) the ordering of any Protective Measures with respect to the Issuer that 
are ordered or confirmed upon the opening of or during any such Restructuring 
Proceedings will constitute a default or an Event of Default.
(b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to any failure of the Issuer to meet 
any payment obligation under these Terms and Conditions and subject to Condition 8 
(Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), (i) such payment obligation (and 
such payment obligation only) will be immediately deemed a due and payable (fällige)
10272857175-v14 111 70-41061831
payment obligation of the Issuer, and (ii) if (A) the relevant Holder has formally requested 
payment of such payment obligation, (B) such payment obligation has not been fulfilled 
within the statutory period under Swiss law commencing after the date of such formal 
request and (C) a writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl) has been issued with respect to such 
payment obligation pursuant to the DEBA, the relevant Holder may institute proceedings 
against the Issuer in Switzerland (but not elsewhere) to enforce its rights with respect to 
such payment obligation under the DEBA.
(c) If a debt collection or insolvency proceeding with respect to the Issuer is instituted in 
Switzerland in accordance with clause (b) of this Condition 13, the Issuer shall not (i) after 
having received the writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl) relating to the relevant payment 
obligation, argue or plead that such payment obligation is not due and payable by the 
Issuer, or (ii) prior to the declaration of bankruptcy (or similar proceeding under Swiss 
insolvency laws), make any payment to the relevant Holder under or in connection with 
the Notes.
(d) In the case of any Event of Default arising under subclause (a)(iii) of this Condition 13 
and subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), any 
Holder may seek specific performance or damages with respect to such Event of Default 
pursuant to the Swiss Code if so entitled thereunder. Any such damage claim of any Holder 
will rank junior to the rights and claims of all holders of Senior Obligations.
(e) In the case of any Event of Default arising under subclause (a)(iv) of this Condition 13 
and subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), any 
Holder may, by written notice to the Issuer, declare the principal amount of any of its 
Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, immediately due and 
payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind.
(f) No remedy against the Issuer other than those described in this Condition 13 will be 
available to the Holders in connection with the Issuer's obligations under these Terms and 
Conditions, whether for the recovery of amounts owing under these Terms and Conditions 
or in respect of any breach by the Issuer of any of its other obligations under these Terms 
and Conditions or otherwise. In particular, no Holder may declare (i) the principal amount 
of any Notes due and payable prior to any Redemption Date, or (ii) any interest on any 
Notes due and payable prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, except, in the case of 
each of subclauses (i) and (ii) of this clause (f), pursuant to clause (e) of this Condition 13.

subject to subclause (v) of this clause (b), be irrevocable, and state the date on 
which such substitution or amendment will be effective (the "Substitution or 
Amendment Effective Date");
(iv) prior to the publication of any notice pursuant to subclause (iii) of this clause (b), 
the Issuer shall deliver to the Fiscal Agent (A) a certificate signed by the 
Authorised Signatories stating that the relevant requirement or circumstance
10272857175-v14 112 70-41061831
giving rise to the right to substitute or amend the terms of the Notes, as applicable, 
pursuant to this clause (b) is satisfied and the reasons therefor and such certificate 
will be conclusive and binding on the Holders, and (B) an opinion of independent 
legal advisers of recognised standing to the effect that circumstances entitling the 
Issuer to exercise its right to substitute or amend the terms of the Notes, as 
applicable, pursuant to this clause (b) have arisen; and
(v) no Trigger Event or Viability Event has occurred prior to the relevant Substitution 
or Amendment Effective Date.

consent of the Holders, substitute any entity (whether or not such entity is organised under 
the laws of Switzerland) (such substitute entity, the "Substitute Issuer") for itself as 
principal debtor under the Notes upon giving no more than 30 and no less than 10 days' 
notice to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices), provided that:

Issuer under, or in respect of, the Notes upon receipt of the written request for 
payment of the relevant amount, and (B) upon the occurrence of a Conversion,

of Condition 9 (Conversion), Condition 11 (Taxation), Condition 13 (Events of

consequential amendments to such Conditions or including such Conditions 
applicable to UBS Group AG and to its obligations under such guarantee in such 
guarantee itself, as applicable;
(iv) the Current Issuer and the Substitute Issuer (A) have entered into such documents 
(the "Substitution Documents") as are necessary to give effect to such 
substitution and pursuant to which the Substitute Issuer has (x) undertaken in 
favour of each Holder to be bound by these Terms and Conditions as the principal 
debtor (on a subordinated basis corresponding to Condition 4 (Status and 
Subordination)) under the Notes in place of the Current Issuer and (y) assumed 
the obligations of the Current Issuer under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and
(B) procure that all action, conditions and things required to be taken, fulfilled 
and done (including, without limitation, the obtaining of any necessary consents) 
to ensure that the Substitution Documents represent valid, legally binding and 
enforceable obligations of the Substitute Issuer have been taken, fulfilled and 
done and are in full force and effect;
(v) if the Substitute Issuer is resident for tax purposes in a jurisdiction (the "New 
Residence") other than that in which the Current Issuer prior to such substitution 
was resident for tax purposes (the "Former Residence"), the Substitution 
Documents contain an undertaking by the Substitute Issuer and/or such other 
provisions as may be necessary to ensure that each Holder has the benefit of an 
undertaking in terms corresponding to the provisions of Condition 11 (Taxation) 
in relation to the payment of all amounts due and payable under, or in respect of, 
the Notes and in relation to the guarantee referred to in subclause (iii) above, with, 
in the case of the Notes but not such guarantee, the substitution of references to 
the Former Residence with references to the New Residence, and an undertaking 
by the Substitute Issuer to indemnify each Holder against any Tax that is imposed 
on it by (or by any authority in or of) the New Residence and, if different, the 
jurisdiction of the Substitute Issuer's organisation with respect to any Note and
10272857175-v14 114 70-41061831
that would not have been so imposed had the substitution not been made, as well 
as against any Tax, and any cost or expense, relating to such substitution;

Substitute Issuer has appointed a process agent as its agent in Switzerland to 
receive service of process on its behalf in relation to any legal proceedings arising 
out of or in connection with the Notes; and
(viii) such substitution does not give rise to a Tax Event or a Regulatory Event.
(b) Upon any substitution pursuant to clause (a) of this Condition 16, (i) the Substitute Issuer 
will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the 
Current Issuer under the Notes with the same effect as if the Substitute Issuer had been

from its obligations under the Notes.
(c) After giving effect to any substitution pursuant to clause (a) of this Condition 16,

references to the Substitute Issuer, and (ii) references to the "Tax Jurisdiction" in the Notes 
and these Terms and Conditions will be read and construed as including the jurisdiction of

Substitute Issuer is resident for tax purposes instead of or in addition to (as the case may 
be) references to the jurisdiction of establishment of the Issuer and Switzerland.
17. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER OR SALE
The Issuer will not consolidate with, merge with or into, or sell, convey, transfer or otherwise 
dispose of all or substantially all of its property and assets (as an entirety or substantially as an 
entirety in one transaction or a series of related transactions) to, any Person (other than with, into or 
to any Person of which at least 95 per cent. of such Person's capital and voting rights are held, 
directly or indirectly, by the Issuer) or permit any Person to merge with or into the Issuer unless 
(a) the Issuer will be the continuing Person, or (b) the Person formed by such consolidation or into 
which the Issuer is merged or that acquired such property and assets of the Issuer expressly assumes 
in writing (or, in the case of an acquisition of property and assets, guarantees) all of the obligations 
of the Issuer under the Notes.
18. FURTHER ISSUES
The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Holders issue further notes and, 
provided that such notes have the same terms and conditions as the Notes in all respects (or in all 
respects except for the issue date and/or first date on which interest is paid), such further notes will 
be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes. If the Issuer issues any such further notes 
pursuant to this Condition 18, references in these Terms and Conditions to "Notes" include such 
further notes, unless the context otherwise requires.
19. CURRENCY INDEMNITY
Any amount received or recovered by any Holder in a currency other than USD (whether as a result 
of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the insolvency, 
winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise) under the Notes will only constitute a 
discharge of the Issuer to the extent of the amount in USD that such Holder is able to purchase 
with the amount so received or recovered in such other currency on the date of such receipt or 
recovery (or, if it is not practicable to purchase USD with such amount on such date, on the first 
date on which it is practicable to do so). If the amount of USD that such Holder is able to purchase 
is less than the amount owed by the Issuer to such Holder under the Notes, the Issuer shall
10272857175-v14 115 70-41061831
indemnify such Holder against any loss sustained by it as a result. In addition, the Issuer shall 
indemnify such Holder for the costs of making such purchase. For purposes of this Condition 19, 
it is sufficient for the relevant Holder to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an 
actual purchase been made. The indemnities under this Condition 19 will (a) constitute a separate 
and independent obligation from the Issuer's other obligations hereunder, (b) give rise to a separate 
and independent cause of action, (c) apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any Holder 
and (d) continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a 
liquidated amount in respect of any amount due under the Notes or any other judgment or order.
20. RULE 144A INFORMATION
If at any time the Issuer is neither a reporting company under Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the 
US Exchange Act, nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the US Exchange 
Act, the Issuer will comply with any applicable requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4) under the US 
Securities Act in relation to the Notes.
21. NO SET-OFF BY HOLDERS
Subject to applicable law, each Holder and Indirect Holder, by acceptance of any direct or 
beneficial interest in a Note, agrees that it will not, and waives its right to, exercise, claim or plead 
any right of set-off, compensation or retention with respect to any amount owed to it by the Issuer 
in respect of, or arising in connection with, the Notes.
22. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
(a) The Notes and all non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the 
Notes are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Switzerland.
(b) The courts of the Canton of Zurich (venue being the City of Zurich) shall have exclusive 
jurisdiction to settle any disputes that may arise out of or in connection with the Notes, 
including any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with the Notes.

subclause (i) of this clause (c), the Issuer will procure the prompt delivery (free 
of charge) of Definitive Certificates to the Fiscal Agent, duly executed without 
interest coupons, registered in the names of the relevant Indirect Holders, 
addresses and denominations provided in a written notice to be given by the 
Depositary or the Issuer to the Fiscal Agent (which notice shall be given subject

Issuer at such

upon written request.

Definitive Certificate that is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed may be 
replaced, subject to applicable laws and regulations, at the Specified Office of the 
Fiscal Agent upon payment by the claimant of the fees, costs and expenses 
incurred by the Fiscal Agent and the Issuer in connection therewith and on such 
terms as to evidence, security and indemnity (which may provide, among other 
things, that if the Definitive Certificate allegedly or actually lost, stole or 
destroyed is subsequently presented for payment there shall be paid to the Issuer 
on demand the amount payable by the Issuer in respect of such Definitive 
Certificate subsequently presented) as the Issuer may require. Mutilated or 
defaced Definitive Certificates must be surrendered before replacements will be

(v) No Person (including any Indirect Holder) other than the Holder(s) will have 
any rights, or be owed any obligations by the Issuer, under the Notes. Payments 
of principal, interest or any other amount in respect of Notes will be made only 
to the Person shown on the Register as the registered holder of such Note (i.e., 
the Holder) at close of business on the relevant Record Date.
(b) Transfer of Notes represented by a Global Certificate
10272790607-v17 83 70-41061831
(i) Global Certificates may be transferred only in whole, but not in part, and only to 
a Relevant Clearing System or any of their respective successors or nominees, in 
each case located outside of Switzerland, except as provided below. Beneficial 
interests of Indirect Holders in Notes represented by Global Certificates may be 
transferred only in accordance with the rules and procedures of such Relevant 
Clearing System, the provisions of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and this 
Condition 3(b).
(ii) A beneficial interest in a Note represented by a Regulation S Global Certificate 
may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial 
interest in a Note represented by a Rule 144A Global Certificate during the 
Distribution Compliance Period, only if such exchange occurs in connection with 
a transfer of beneficial interests in the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A and the 
transferor first delivers to the Fiscal Agent and the Registrar a written certificate 
substantially in the form of a certificate available on request from the Registrar to 
the effect that the beneficial interests in the Notes are being transferred to a Person 
who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A 
under the US Securities Act, purchasing the beneficial interests in the Notes for 
its own account or the account of a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements 
of Rule 144A and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states 
of the United States and other jurisdictions.
(iii) A beneficial interest in a Note represented by a Rule 144A Global Certificate may 
be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest 
in a Note represented by a Regulation S Global Certificate, whether before or after 
the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, only if the transferor first 
delivers to the Fiscal Agent and the Registrar a written certificate substantially in 
the form of a certificate available on request from the Registrar to the effect that 
the transfer is being conducted in compliance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of 
Regulation S under the US Securities Act.
(iv) Until the termination of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests 
in any Regulation S Global Certificate may be held only through participants 
acting for and on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, provided 
that this subclause (iv) shall not prohibit any transfer in accordance with 
subclause (ii) of this Condition 3(b).
(c) Transfer of Notes represented by a Definitive Certificate
(i) If and when Definitive Certificates have been issued pursuant to Condition 2(c), 
one or more Notes may be transferred only in accordance with the legends set 
forth upon the face of the relevant Definitive Certificate and only upon the 
surrender (at the Specified Office of the Registrar) of the Definitive Certificate 
representing such Notes to be transferred, together with the form of transfer 
attached to such Definitive Certificate (or another form of transfer substantially 
in the same form and containing the same representations and certifications (if 
any), unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer), duly completed and executed and 
any other evidence as the Fiscal Agent and the Registrar may reasonably 
require. A new Definitive Certificate shall be issued to the transferee in respect 
of the Notes that are the subject of the relevant transfer and, in the case of a 
transfer of part only of a holding of Notes represented by one Definitive 
Certificate, a new Definitive Certificate in respect of the balance of the Notes 
not transferred shall be issued to the transferor. In the case of a transfer of Notes 
to a Person who is already a Holder, a new Definitive Certificate representing 
the enlarged holding may be issued but only against surrender of the Definitive 
Certificate representing the existing holding of such Person.
(ii) Each new Definitive Certificate to be issued pursuant to Condition 2(c) shall be 
available for delivery within three Relevant Banking Days of receipt of the form 
of transfer and surrender of the relevant Definitive Certificate. Delivery of new 
Definitive Certificate(s) will be made at the Specified Office of the Fiscal Agent
10272790607-v17 84 70-41061831
to which delivery and surrender of such form of transfer and Definitive Certificate 
or, as the case may be, surrender of such Definitive Certificate, will have been 
made or, at the option of the relevant Holder and as specified in the relevant form 
of transfer or otherwise in writing, be mailed by uninsured post at the risk of the 
Holder entitled to the new Definitive Certificate to such address as may be so 
specified, unless such Holder requests otherwise and pays in advance to the Fiscal 
Agent the costs of such other method of delivery and/or such insurance as it may 
specify.
(d) Rule 144A
Each Note that is initially sold in the United States to a QIB will not be registered under 
the US Securities Act, or with any securities regulatory authority of any state or other 
jurisdiction of the United States and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred, 
except (i) in accordance with Rule 144A to a Person that the Holder and any Person acting 
on its behalf reasonably believe is a QIB that is acquiring the Notes for its own account or 
for the account of one or more QIBs, (ii) in an offshore transaction in accordance with 
Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S under the US Securities Act, (iii) pursuant to an 
exemption from registration under Rule 144 under the US Securities Act, or in accordance 
with another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, registration under the US 
Securities Act, if available, or (iv) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 
US Securities Act, in each case, in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any 
state of the United States.
4. STATUS AND SUBORDINATION
(a) Status
The Notes constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer and rank 
pari passu and without any preference among themselves. The rights and claims of the 
Holders against the Issuer under the Notes are subordinated as described in clause (b) of 
this Condition 4.
(b) Subordination
In the event of (i) a Bankruptcy Event or (ii) an order being made, or an effective 
resolution being passed, for the liquidation or winding-up of the Issuer (except, in any such 
case, a solvent liquidation or winding-up of the Issuer solely for purposes of a 
reorganisation, reconstruction or amalgamation of the Issuer or the substitution in place of 
the Issuer of a successor in business to the Issuer, the terms of which reorganisation, 
reconstruction, amalgamation or substitution (x) have previously been approved by a valid 
resolution of the Holders and (y) do not provide that the Notes shall become redeemable in 
accordance with these Terms and Conditions),
(i) if such event occurs (x) prior to the occurrence of a Conversion Capital 
Availability Event, or (y) on or after the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event but prior to the occurrence of a Conversion 
Event, the rights and claims of the Holders against the Issuer in respect 
of or arising under (including, without limitation, any damages awarded 
for breach of any obligation under) the Notes will, subject to any 
obligations that are mandatorily preferred by law, rank (A) junior to the 
rights and claims of all holders of Senior Obligations,
(B) pari passu with the rights and claims of holders of Parity 
Obligations, and
(C) senior to the rights and claims of holders of Junior Obligations; 
provided, however, that, if a Conversion Event subsequently occurs while 
such Bankruptcy Event or liquidation or winding-up, as the case may be, 
is continuing, the rights and claims of the Holders against the Issuer in 
respect of the delivery of Ordinary Shares in accordance with Condition 
9 (Conversion) will rank as set forth in subclause (ii) below; or
(ii) if such event occurs on or after the occurrence of a Conversion Event, 
the rights and claims of the Holders against the Issuer in respect of the 
delivery of Ordinary
10272790607-v17 85 70-41061831
Shares in accordance with Condition 9 (Conversion) will rank (A) junior 
to the rights and claims of all holders of Senior Obligations, (B) junior to 
the rights and claims of holders of Parity Obligations, and (C) pari passu 
with the rights and claims of holders of Junior Obligations.
(c) Claims subject to a Contingent Write-down or a Conversion
Any claim of any Holder in respect of or arising under the Notes (including, without 
limitation, any claim in relation to any unsatisfied payment obligation of the Issuer 
subject to enforcement by any Holder pursuant to Condition 13 (Events of Default) or in 
relation to the occurrence of any other Event of Default) will be subject to, and 
superseded by, Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), as 
applicable, irrespective of whether the relevant Trigger Event or Viability Event, as 
applicable, has occurred, or, in the case of a Viability Event, the relevant Viability Event 
Notice has been given, prior to or after the occurrence of an Event of Default or any 
other event.
5. INTEREST
(a) Interest Payment Dates
(i) Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) 
and clause (g) of this Condition 5, the Notes will bear interest on their principal 
amount (A) from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the First Call 
Date, at the Fixed Interest Rate, and (B) thereafter, at the applicable Reset 
Interest Rate.
(ii) Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) 
and clause (h) of this Condition 5, interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually in arrear on 13 May and 13 November of each year (each, an "Interest 
Payment Date"), commencing on 13 May 2024.
(b) Determination of the Treasury Yield, the Reset Interest Rate and the Reset Interest 
Amount in relation to each Reset Interest Period
With respect to each Reset Interest Period, the Calculation Agent will, as soon as 
practicable on the Reset Determination Date in relation to such Reset Interest Period, 
determine the Treasury Yield and the Reset Interest Rate for such Reset Interest Period 
and calculate the amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount on the Interest 
Payment Date in relation to each Interest Period falling in such Reset Interest Period (each, 
a "Reset Interest Amount").
(c) Publication of Reset Interest Rate and interest amount payable upon redemption
With respect to each Reset Interest Period, as soon as practicable after such determination 
but in any event no later than the relevant Reset Date, the Calculation Agent will cause
(i) the relevant Reset Interest Rate and the relevant Reset Interest Amount determined by 
it, together with the Interest Payment Date in relation to each Interest Period falling in 
such Reset Interest Period, to be notified to the Issuer and the Paying Agents and (ii) the 
relevant Reset Interest Rate determined by it to be notified to any stock exchange or other 
relevant authority on which the Notes are at the relevant time listed and to be published in 
accordance with Condition 15 (Notices).
The Calculation Agent shall calculate any interest amount payable on any Redemption 
Date (if the Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to Condition 6 (Redemption and 
Purchase)) and cause such interest amount to be notified to Issuer and the Paying Agents 
and to any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the Notes are at the 
relevant time listed and to be published in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) no 
later than two Business Days prior to such Redemption Date.
10272790607-v17 86 70-41061831
(d) Calculation of amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount
Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) and clause 
(h) of this Condition 5:
(i) the amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount on each Interest Payment 
Date to (and including) the First Call Date in respect of the Notes will be 
USD 46.25; and
(ii) if interest is required to be paid in respect of a Note on any other date (including, 
for the avoidance of doubt, the Reset Interest Amount), the amount of interest 
payable per Calculation Amount on such date will be calculated by:
(A) applying the applicable Interest Rate to the Calculation Amount;
(B) multiplying the product thereof by the Day Count Fraction; and
(C) rounding the resulting figure to the nearest cent (half a cent being 
rounded upwards).
(e) Calculation of amount of interest payable per Note
Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) and 
clause (h) of this Condition 5, the amount of interest payable in respect of a Note will be 
the product of:
(i) the amount of interest per Calculation Amount; and
(ii) the number by which the Calculation Amount is required to be multiplied to equal 
the denomination of such Note.
(f) Notifications, etc. to be final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and 
decisions given, expressed, made or obtained by the Calculation Agent for purposes of 
this Condition 5 will (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith and manifest error) be 
binding on the Issuer, the Agents and the Holders and (in the absence of wilful default 
and bad faith) no liability to the Issuer or the Holders will attach to the Calculation 
Agent in connection with the exercise or non-exercise by the Calculation Agent of its 
powers, duties and discretions under this Condition 5.
(g) Accrual of interest in the case of redemption or a Trigger Event or a Viability Event
(i) Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), 
if the Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to clause (b), (c) or (d) of Condition 6 
(Redemption and Purchase), interest on the Notes will accrue to (but excluding) 
the relevant Redemption Date, and will cease to accrue on such Redemption 
Date; provided, however, that if the payment with respect to any Note is 
improperly withheld or refused on such Redemption Date, interest will continue 
to accrue on the principal amount of such Note (both before and after judgment) 
at the relevant Interest Rate to the Relevant Date.
(ii) Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event or a Viability Event, interest on the 
Notes will cease to accrue from (and including) the date on which such Trigger 
Event or Viability Event occurs.
(h) Cancellation of interest; prohibited interest
(i) The Issuer may, in its sole discretion, elect to cancel all or part of any payment 
of interest on the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any related 
Additional Amounts) that is otherwise scheduled to be paid on an Interest 
Payment Date. This subclause (h)(i) is without prejudice to the provisions of
10272790607-v17 87 70-41061831
subclause (h)(ii) of this Condition 5. Non-payment of any amount of interest by 
the Issuer to the Fiscal Agent will constitute evidence of cancellation of the 
relevant payment, whether or not notice of cancellation has been given by the 
Issuer.
If practicable, the Issuer shall provide notice of any cancellation of interest (in 
whole or in part) pursuant to this subclause (h)(i) to the Holders on or prior to the 
relevant Interest Payment Date. If practicable, the Issuer shall endeavour to 
provide such notice at least five Business Days prior to the relevant Interest 
Payment Date. Failure to provide such notice will not have any impact on the 
effectiveness of, or otherwise invalidate, any such cancellation of interest, or give 
Holders any rights as a result of such failure.
(ii) The Issuer will be prohibited from making, in whole or in part, any payment of 
interest on the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any related 
Additional Amounts) on the relevant Interest Payment Date if and to the extent 
that:
(A) the amount of Distributable Items as at such Interest Payment Date is 
less than the sum of (1) the amount of such interest payment, plus (2) 
all other payments (other than redemption payments) made by UBS 
Group AG on or in respect of the Notes or any Parity Obligations or 
Junior Obligations since the balance sheet date of the Relevant 
Accounts and prior to such Interest Payment Date, plus (3) all payments 
(other than redemption payments) payable by UBS Group AG on such 
Interest Payment Date on or in respect of any Parity Obligations or 
Junior Obligations, in the case of each of subclauses (1), (2) and (3), 
excluding any portion of such payments already accounted for in 
determining the amount of such Distributable Items; and/or
(B) UBS Group AG is not, or will not immediately after the relevant 
payment of interest be, in compliance with all applicable minimum 
capital adequacy requirements of the National Regulations on a 
consolidated (Finanzgruppe) basis (for the avoidance of doubt, it being 
understood that such minimum requirements will reflect any reduction 
in such requirements granted by FINMA to the Group pursuant to the 
Capital Adequacy Ordinance); and/or
(C) FINMA has required the Issuer not to make such interest payment.
The Issuer shall deliver a certificate signed by the Authorised Signatories to the 
Fiscal Agent and shall give notice in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) to 
the Holders, in each case as soon as practicable following any determination that 
interest is required to be cancelled pursuant to this subclause (h)(ii) or, where no 
such prior determination is made, promptly following any Interest Payment Date 
on which interest was scheduled to be paid if such interest is being cancelled in 
accordance with this subclause (h)(ii), to such effect setting out brief details as 
to the amount of interest being cancelled and the reason therefor. Failure to 
provide such certificate and notice will not have any impact on the effectiveness 
of, or otherwise invalidate, any such cancellation or give any Holder any rights 
as a result of such failure.
(iii) If, on any Interest Payment Date, any payment of interest scheduled to be made 
on such date is not made in full pursuant to subclause (h)(i) or subclause (h)(ii) of 
this Condition 5, UBS Group AG shall not, directly or indirectly,
(A) recommend to Shareholders that any dividend or other distribution in 
cash or in kind (other than in the form of Ordinary Shares) be paid or 
made on any Ordinary Shares; or
10272790607-v17 88 70-41061831
(B) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any Ordinary Shares other than as 
a Permitted Transaction,
in each case unless and until (x) the interest payment due and payable on the 
Notes on any subsequent Interest Payment Date has been paid in full (or an 
amount equal to the same has been paid in full to a designated third party trust 
account for the benefit of the Holders prior to payment by the trustee thereof to 
the Holders on such subsequent Interest Payment Date) or, if earlier, (y) all 
outstanding Notes have been cancelled in accordance with these Terms and 
Conditions.
(iv) Payments of interest on the Notes are not cumulative. Notwithstanding any other 
provision in these Terms and Conditions, the cancellation or non-payment of 
any interest amount by virtue of this Condition 5(h) will not constitute a default 
for any purpose (including, without limitation, Condition 13 (Events of Default)) 
on the part of the Issuer. Any interest payment not paid by virtue of this 
Condition 5(h) will not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter, and 
Holders will have no right thereto.
(v) If UBS Group AG determines, after consultation with FINMA, that the Notes do 
not, or will cease to, fully qualify as Additional Tier 1 Capital, (A) the Issuer 
shall not, to the extent permitted under National Regulations, exercise its 
discretion pursuant to subclause (h)(i) of this Condition 5 to cancel any interest 
payments due on the Notes on any Interest Payment Date following the 
occurrence of such determination, and (B) the Issuer shall give notice to the 
Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) as soon as practicable after 
such determination stating that the Issuer may no longer exercise its discretion 
pursuant to subclause (h)(i) of this Condition 5 to cancel any interest payments 
as from the date of such notice.
6. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE
(a) No fixed redemption date
The Notes are perpetual securities in respect of which there is no fixed redemption date. 
Unless previously redeemed (including by way of Conversion pursuant to Condition 9 
(Conversion)) or purchased and cancelled in accordance with this Condition 6 and 
subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), the Notes 
are perpetual and may only be redeemed or purchased in accordance with this Condition 
6.
(b) Redemption at the option of the Issuer
Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 6, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to

and unpaid interest thereon to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date.
(c) Redemption due to a Tax Event
(i) Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 6, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event at 
any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to

their aggregate principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest 
thereon to (but excluding) such Redemption Date.
(ii) A "Tax Event" will have occurred if the Issuer in making any payments on the 
Notes (A) has paid, or will or would on the next payment date be required to 
pay, Additional Amounts, or (B) has paid, or will or would be required to pay, 
any additional Tax in respect of the Notes, in the case of each of subclauses (A) 
and (B), under the laws or regulations of a Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof or any authority of or in a Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof having the power to impose, levy, collect, withhold or assess 
Taxes, including, without limitation, any treaty to which a Tax Jurisdiction is a 
party, or
10272790607-v17 89 70-41061831
any generally published application or interpretation of such laws (including, 
without limitation, a decision of any court or tribunal, any generally published 
application or interpretation of such laws by any relevant tax authority or any 
generally published pronouncement by any relevant tax authority), and the Issuer 
cannot avoid the foregoing by taking measures reasonably available to it.
(d) Redemption due to a Regulatory Event
(i) Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 6, upon the occurrence of a Regulatory 
Event at any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, 
to redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, on the relevant Redemption Date at 
their aggregate principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest 
thereon to (but excluding) such Redemption Date.
(ii) A "Regulatory Event" will have occurred if any of the Notes ceases to be eligible 
in full to be (A) treated as Additional Tier 1 Capital, and/or (B) counted towards 
either the Going-Concern LR Requirement or the Going-Concern RWA 
Requirement (or both).
(e) Conditions for redemption
(i) If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes pursuant to clause (b), (c) or (d) of this 
Condition 6, then the Issuer shall give the Holders not less than 15 and not more 
than 60 days' prior notice in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) (a 
"Redemption Notice"), which notice shall, subject to subclauses (ii) and (iii) of 
this clause (e), be irrevocable and specify (x) the clause of this Condition 6 
pursuant to which the redemption is to be made, (y) if any Definitive Certificates 
have been issued, the method by which Notes to be redeemed will be tendered, 
and (z) the date (which date, in the case of a redemption pursuant to clause (c) or
(d) of this Condition 6, shall be a Payment Business Day) on which the Issuer 
will redeem the Notes pursuant to such clause of this Condition 6 (such specified 
date, the "Redemption Date").
(ii) The Issuer may only redeem the Notes pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of this 
Condition 6 on the relevant Redemption Date if FINMA has approved such 
redemption on or prior to such Redemption Date, if such approval is then required 
under applicable Swiss laws and regulations.
(iii) The Issuer may only redeem the Notes pursuant to any clause of this Condition 6 
on the relevant Redemption Date if no Trigger Event or Viability Event has 
occurred prior to such Redemption Date.
(iv) If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes pursuant to clause (c) or (d) of this 
Condition 6, then prior to the publication of the Redemption Notice pursuant to 
subclause (e)(i) of this Condition 6, the Issuer shall deliver to the Fiscal Agent 
(A) a certificate signed by the Authorised Signatories stating that the relevant 
requirement or circumstance giving rise to the right to redeem under clause (c) or 
(d), as applicable, of this Condition 6 is satisfied and the reasons therefor and such 
certificate will be conclusive and binding on the Holders, and (B) in the case of a 
redemption pursuant to clause (c) of this Condition 6 only, an opinion of 
independent legal advisers of recognised standing to the effect that circumstances 
entitling the Issuer to exercise its right of redemption under clause (c) of this 
Condition 6 have arisen.
(f) Purchases
The Issuer or any other member of the Group or any of their respective affiliates may at 
any time purchase Notes at any price in the open market or otherwise, provided that
(i) such purchase complies with any limits or conditions to which any member of the 
Group is subject under applicable banking laws and regulations at the time of such 
purchase, (ii) other than in the case of purchases made in connection with stabilisation
10272790607-v17 90 70-41061831
measures in compliance with applicable law or in connection with any market making in 
the Notes, FINMA has approved such purchase (if such approval is then required under 
applicable Swiss laws and regulations) on or prior to the date of such purchase, and (iii) no 
Trigger Event or Viability Event has occurred prior to the date of such purchase. Any 
Notes so purchased may, at the option of the Issuer, be held, reissued, resold or cancelled.
(g) Cancellation
All Notes redeemed in accordance with this Condition 6 or by way of Conversion 
pursuant to Condition 9 (Conversion) will be cancelled and may not be reissued or

the Issuer will not take any action to cause such Notes to be removed from the Relevant 
Clearing System prior to the later of (i) the applicable Settlement Date and (ii) the Final 
Cancellation Date. Following the issuance and delivery of the relevant Ordinary Shares 
to the Settlement Share Depository on the Conversion Date and until the later of (i) the 
applicable Settlement Date and (ii) the Final Cancellation Date, the Notes will evidence 
solely the Holder's right to receive Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds, as the case 
may be, from the Settlement Share Depository or the Settlement Shares Offer Agent (or 
such other relevant recipient).
(h) Redemption of other instruments
For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that, if, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event 
or a Regulatory Event, the Issuer does not elect to redeem the Notes pursuant to this 
Condition 6, nothing in this Condition 6 or any other provision of these Terms and 
Conditions will prohibit the Issuer from redeeming (whether early, at maturity or 
otherwise) any other instruments issued by any member of the Group pursuant to the 
terms thereof.
7. TRIGGER EVENT AND VIABILITY EVENT
(a) Trigger Event
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event:
(A) if such Trigger Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Contingent Write-down will occur on the 
applicable Trigger Event Write-down Date in accordance with Condition 
8 (Contingent Write-down); or
(B) if such Trigger Event occurs on or after the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Conversion will occur on the applicable 
Trigger Event Conversion Date in accordance with Condition 9 
(Conversion).
(ii) A "Trigger Event" will have occurred if the Issuer gives the Holders a Trigger 
Event Notice in accordance with clause (b) of this Condition 7.
(b) Trigger Event Notice

Notice") to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) (x) if such 
Publication Date is an Ordinary Publication Date, within five Business Days of 
such Ordinary Publication Date (such fifth Business Day, the "Trigger Breach 
Determination Date", and the date of such notice, the "Ordinary Trigger 
Event Notice Date"), and (y) if such Publication Date is an Extraordinary

Conversion Capital Availability Event (1) state that the Trigger CET1 
Ratio as of such Publication Date is less than the Threshold Ratio, and a 
Contingent Write-down will take place, and (2) specify the date on 
which the Contingent Write-down will take place, which date shall, 
subject to postponement pursuant to subclause (ii) of this Condition 
7(b), be no later than 10 Business Days after the date of such notice (the 
"Trigger Event Write-down Date"); or
(B) if such Trigger Event Notice is given on or after the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, (1) state that the Trigger CET1 
Ratio as of such Publication Date is less than the Threshold Ratio, and a 
Conversion will take place, (2) specify the date on which the 
Conversion will take place, which date shall, subject to postponement 
pursuant to subclause (ii) of this Condition 7(b), be no more than 20 
Business Days after the date of such notice (the "Trigger Event 
Conversion Date"), (3) specify the Conversion Price in effect on the 
date of such Trigger Event Notice, and (4) specify the details of the 
arrangement for the settlement of the Conversion (including whether or 
not the Issuer will appoint a Settlement Shares Offer Agent to conduct a 
Settlement Shares Offer, the Suspension Date, the details of the 
Settlement Share Depository (including its Specified Office) or, if the 
Issuer is unable to appoint a Settlement Share Depository prior to 
giving of such notice, the other arrangements it has made in accordance 
with subclause (h)(i) of Condition 9 (Conversion) for the issuance and 
delivery of the Ordinary Shares to be issued and delivered upon 
Conversion to the Holders, the procedures Holders must follow to 
obtain delivery of the Ordinary Shares from the Settlement Share 
Depository, the Settlement Notice Cut-Off Date and the Final 
Cancellation Date).
(ii) If a Trigger Event Notice is required to be given pursuant to subclause (i) of this 
Condition 7(b), and on the relevant Publication Date any Higher-Trigger 
Contingent Capital is outstanding with respect to which either (x) no HigherTrigger Write-down/Conversion Notice has been given prior to the Trigger 
Event Notice Date or (y) a Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion Notice has 
been given prior to the Trigger Event Notice Date, but the Trigger Event Writedown Date or the Trigger Event Conversion Date, as applicable, is scheduled to 
occur prior to the relevant Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion Date,
(A) in the case of subclause (x) above, the giving of such Trigger Event 
Notice will be postponed until the date on which a Higher-Trigger Writedown/Conversion Notice has been given with respect to all such 
outstanding Higher-Trigger Contingent Capital and such date will be 
deemed to be the Trigger Event Notice Date; and
(B) in the case of subclauses (x) and (y) above, if the Trigger Event Writedown Date or the Trigger Event Conversion Date, as applicable, is 
scheduled to occur prior to the Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion 
Date (or, in the case of more than one Higher-Trigger Writedown/Conversion Date, the latest Higher-Trigger Writedown/Conversion Date), the Trigger Event Write-down Date or the 
Trigger Event Conversion Date, as applicable, will be postponed to the 
Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion Date (or the latest HigherTrigger Write-down/Conversion Date, as applicable) and such 
postponement shall be specified in such Trigger Event Notice.
(iii) If (A) a Trigger Event Notice is required to be given pursuant to subclause (i) of 
this Condition 7(b) in relation to an Ordinary Publication Date, and (B) prior to 
the earlier of the Ordinary Trigger Event Notice Date and the Trigger Breach 
Determination Date, FINMA, upon the request of UBS Group AG, has agreed in 
writing that a Contingent Write-down or a Conversion, as applicable, is not
10272790607-v17 92 70-41061831
required as a result of actions taken by the Group or circumstances or events, in 
each case, that have had, or imminently will have, the effect of restoring the CET1 
Ratio as of the Balance Sheet Date relating to the relevant Ordinary Publication 
Date, after giving pro forma effect to such actions, circumstances or events, to a 
level above the Threshold Ratio that FINMA and UBS Group AG deem, in their 
sole discretion, to be adequate at such time, (x) the Issuer shall not give such 
Trigger Event Notice pursuant to subclause (i) of this Condition 7(b) in relation to 
the relevant Ordinary Publication Date, and (y) the Issuer shall give notice to the 
Holders on or prior to the Trigger Breach Determination Date in accordance with 
Condition 15 (Notices), which notice shall state that no Contingent Write-down or 
Conversion, as applicable, will occur in relation to the relevant Ordinary 
Publication Date.
(c) Viability Event
(i) Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 7, upon the occurrence of a Viability Event:
(A) the Issuer shall give notice (a "Viability Event Notice") to the Holders 
in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) within three days of the date 
on which such Viability Event occurred, which notice shall:
(1) if such Viability Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, (x) state that a Viability 
Event has occurred and a Contingent Write-down will take place 
and (y) specify the date on which the Contingent Write-down 
will take place, which date shall be no later than 10 Business 
Days after the date of such notice (such specified date, the 
"Viability Event Write-down Date"); or
(2) if such Viability Event occurs on or after the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, (w) state that a Viability 
Event has occurred and a Conversion will take place, (x) specify 
the date on which the Conversion will take place, which date 
shall be no more than 20 Business Days following the 
occurrence of the Viability Event (the "Viability Event 
Conversion Date"), (y) specify the Conversion Price in effect 
on the date of such Viability Event Notice, and (z) specify the 
details of the arrangements for the settlement of the Conversion 
(including the Suspension Date, the details of the Settlement 
Share Depository (including its Specified Office) or, if the Issuer 
is unable to appoint a Settlement Share Depository prior to 
giving of such notice, the other arrangements it has made in 
accordance with subclause (h)(i) of Condition 9 (Conversion) 
for the issuance and delivery of the Ordinary Shares to be issued 
and delivered upon Conversion to the Holders, the procedures 
Holders must follow to obtain delivery of the Ordinary Shares 
from the Settlement Share Depository, the Settlement Notice 
Cut-Off Date and the Final Cancellation Date); and
(B) if such Viability Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Contingent Write-down will occur on the 
applicable Viability Event Write-down Date in accordance Condition 8 
(Contingent Write-down); or
(C) if such Viability Event occurs on or after the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Conversion will occur on the applicable 
Viability Event Conversion Date in accordance with Condition 9 
(Conversion).
10272790607-v17 93 70-41061831
(ii) A "Viability Event" will have occurred if prior to an Alternative Loss Absorption 
Date (if any):
(A) FINMA has notified UBS Group AG in writing that it has determined a 
conversion or write-down, as applicable, of holders' claims in respect of 
the Notes and all other capital instruments issued by, or other capital 
obligations (whether qualifying fully or partially for capital treatment) 
of, any member of the Group that, pursuant to their terms or by 
operation of law, are capable of being converted into equity or written 
down at that time, is, because customary measures to improve the 
Group Holding Company's capital adequacy are at the time inadequate 
or infeasible, an essential requirement to prevent the Group Holding 
Company from becoming insolvent, bankrupt, unable to pay a material 
part of its debts as they fall due or unable to carry on its business; or
(B) customary measures to improve the Group Holding Company's capital 
adequacy being at the time inadequate or infeasible, the Group Holding 
Company has received an irrevocable commitment of direct or indirect 
extraordinary support from the Public Sector (beyond customary 
transactions and arrangements in the ordinary course) that has, or 
imminently will have, the effect of improving the Group Holding 
Company's capital adequacy and without which, in the determination of 
(and as notified in writing by) FINMA, the Group Holding Company 
would have become insolvent, bankrupt, unable to pay a material part 
of its debts as they fall due or unable to carry on its business.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that a Viability Event may occur 
irrespective of whether or not a Trigger Event has occurred or whether any of 
the conditions to the issuance of a Trigger Event Notice have been met.
(d) Determination of CET1 Ratio and Trigger CET1 Ratio
With respect to any Publication Date, (i) the CET1 Ratio as of the relevant Balance Sheet 
Date, (ii) the Trigger CET1 Ratio as of such Publication Date and (iii) the components of 
both of the foregoing, in each case, as published on such Publication Date, will be final for 
purposes of this Condition 7, and any revisions, restatements or adjustments to any of the 
calculations described in subclauses (i) through (iii) of this clause (d) subsequently 
published will have no effect for purposes of this Condition 7.
(e) Alternative loss absorption
In the event of the implementation of any new, or amendment to or change in the 
interpretation of any existing, laws or components of National Regulations, in each case 
occurring after the Issue Date, that alone or together with any other law(s) or regulation(s) 
has, in the joint determination of UBS Group AG and FINMA, the effect that clause (c) 
of this Condition 7 could cease to apply to the Notes without giving rise to a Regulatory 
Event, then the Issuer shall give notice to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices) no later than five Business Days after such joint determination stating that such 
provisions will cease to apply from the date of such notice (the "Alternative Loss 
Absorption Date"), and from the date of such notice, such provisions will cease to apply 
to the Notes.
(f) Conversion Capital Availability Event
(i) A "Conversion Capital Availability Event" will have occurred on the first date 
after the Issue Date on which an amendment to the Articles of Association is 
registered in the main register (Hauptregister) of the Commercial Register 
(Handelsregister) of the Canton of Zurich as a result of which the Conversion 
Capital provided for in the Articles of Association meets or exceeds the Minimum
10272790607-v17 94 70-41061831
Conversion Capital Availability Amount. For purposes of these Terms and 
Conditions, a Conversion Capital Availability Event may occur only once.
For purposes of the definition of Conversion Capital Availability Event:
"Articles of Association" means, at any time, the articles of association (Statuten) 
of UBS Group AG in effect at such time.
"Minimum Conversion Capital Availability Amount" means, at any time, the 
amount of Conversion Capital that UBS Group AG would require in order for it 
to create and issue:
(A) the number of Ordinary Shares into which the Notes outstanding at such 
time would be converted if they were to be converted at the Conversion 
Price in effect at such time and otherwise in accordance with these Terms 
and Conditions; and
(B) if any Other Tier 1 Contingent Convertible Capital Notes are outstanding 
at such time, the number of Ordinary Shares into which such Other Tier 1 
Contingent Convertible Capital Notes would be converted if they were 
to be converted at the conversion price then in effect pursuant to, and 
otherwise in accordance with, their respective terms at such time,
in each case, out of such Conversion Capital.
"Other Tier 1 Contingent Convertible Capital Note" means a capital 
instrument (other than the Notes) that:
(A) is eligible in full to be (A) treated as Additional Tier 1 Capital and
(B) counted towards either the Going-Concern LR Requirement or the 
Going-Concern RWA Requirement (or both); and
(B) subject to the terms and conditions thereof, is to be:
(x) converted into Ordinary Shares; or
(y) after a Conversion Capital Availability Event (or equivalent 
event described in the terms and conditions thereof) occurs, 
converted into Ordinary Shares,
in either case, when the CET1 Ratio (or equivalent capital measure of the 
Group described in the terms and conditions thereof) falls below a certain 
threshold and/or a Viability Event (or equivalent event described in the 
terms and conditions thereof) occurs.
(ii) If a Conversion Capital Availability Event occurs at any time on or prior to a 
Trigger Event or a Viability Event, the Issuer shall as soon as practicable 
thereafter deliver to the Fiscal Agent and the Settlement Agent a certificate signed 
by the Authorised Signatories and notice to the Holders in accordance with 
Condition 15 (Notices), in each case stating that a Conversion Capital Availability 
Event has occurred and the date on which it occurred.
8. CONTINGENT WRITE-DOWN
If the Issuer has given a Trigger Event Write-down Notice or a Viability Event Write-down Notice 
in accordance with Condition 7 (Trigger Event and Viability Event), then on the relevant Writedown Date:
(a) the full principal amount of, and any accrued and unpaid interest (whether or not due and 
payable) on, each Note will automatically be written down to zero, the Notes will be 
cancelled and all references to the principal amount of the Notes in these Terms and 
Conditions will be construed accordingly;
10272790607-v17 95 70-41061831
(b) the Holders will be automatically deemed to have irrevocably waived their right to 
receive, and will no longer have any rights against the Issuer with respect to, repayment 
of the aggregate principal amount of, and payment of any accrued and unpaid interest on, 
the Notes written down pursuant to subclause (a) of this Condition 8 (bedingter 
Forderungsverzicht); and
(c) all rights of any Holder for payment of any amounts under or in respect of the Notes 
(including, without limitation, any amounts arising as a result of, or due and payable 
upon the occurrence of, an Event of Default) will become null and void, irrespective of 
whether such amounts have become due and payable prior to the date of the relevant 
Trigger Event Notice or Viability Event Notice, as the case may be, or the Write-down 
Date.
9. CONVERSION
(a) Conversion upon a Trigger Event or a Viability Event
If the Issuer has given a Trigger Event Conversion Notice or a Viability Event Conversion 
Notice in accordance with Condition 7 (Trigger Event and Viability Event), then:
(i) each Note shall, subject to and as provided in this Condition 9, be redeemed and 
settled (the "Conversion") on the applicable Conversion Date by (x) the delivery 
of new fully paid Ordinary Shares to the Settlement Share Depository on behalf 
of the Holders, and (y) the cancellation of any accrued and unpaid interest on the 
Notes (whether or not due and payable); and
(ii) receipt by the Settlement Share Depository of such number of Ordinary Shares as 
is required to satisfy in full its obligation to deliver Ordinary Shares in respect of 
the Conversion on the applicable Conversion Date shall be a good and complete 
discharge of the Issuer's (and, if UBS Group AG is not the Issuer, UBS Group 
AG's) obligations in respect of the Notes.
In the case of the Ordinary Shares to be delivered upon Conversion, as from the applicable 
Share Creation Date for such Ordinary Shares, there is no provision for the reconversion 
of such Ordinary Shares into Notes.
(b) Recourse for Ordinary Shares
Holders shall have recourse only to the Issuer for the issue and delivery of Ordinary Shares 
to the Settlement Share Depository pursuant to these Terms and Conditions. After such 
delivery to the Settlement Share Depository, Holders shall have recourse only to the 
Settlement Share Depository for the delivery to them of such Ordinary Shares or, in the 
circumstances described in clause (h) of this Condition 9, any cash amounts to which such 
Holders are entitled under clause (h) of this Condition 9.
(c) Conversion Price and determination of number of Ordinary Shares
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Conversion Event, as at the date on which the relevant 
Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice is 
published, each Holder shall be deemed to have accepted, and hereby accepts and 
agrees, (A) to the conversion of its holding of Notes into Ordinary Shares at the 
Conversion Price provided for herein and that, where necessary under Swiss law, 
the Settlement Agent shall effect such conversion on such Holder's behalf, and
(B) that its obligation to pay up the Ordinary Shares to be issued shall be set off 
against its claim for repayment of the principal amount upon redemption of the 
Notes, which claim shall be deemed to be due and payable immediately prior to 
the time on the Share Creation Date when, as a matter of Swiss law, the relevant 
Ordinary Shares are paid up. Such Ordinary Shares shall be paid up and issued on 
the Share Creation Date whereupon the Holders shall cease as a matter of Swiss 
law to be treated for all purposes under Swiss law as Holders and shall instead as 
of such date be treated for all purposes under Swiss law as Shareholders.
10272790607-v17 96 70-41061831
(ii) Subject to clause (g) of this Condition 9, the Issuer, with the assistance of the 
Settlement Agent, where necessary under Swiss law, shall issue and deliver to the 
Settlement Share Depository on the applicable Conversion Date such number of 
Ordinary Shares in respect of each Holder as is determined by the Settlement 
Agent by dividing the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by such Holder 
on the applicable Conversion Date by the Conversion Price in effect on the date 
of relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion 
Notice, as the case may be. The Settlement Agent shall determine such number 
of Ordinary Shares in accordance with this subclause (ii) as soon as practicable 
after publication of the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability 
Event Conversion Notice, as applicable.
(iii) The initial Conversion Price per Ordinary Share in respect of the Notes is 
specified in the definition thereof. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment 
to (and including) the date of the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or 
Viability Event Conversion Notice, as the case may be, in the circumstances 
described in clause (d) below.
(d) Anti-dilution adjustment of the Conversion Price
(i) Upon the occurrence of any of the events described below after 8 November 2023, 
the Conversion Price will be adjusted by the Issuer as follows:
(A) If there is a consolidation, reclassification, redesignation or subdivision 
in relation to the Ordinary Shares that alters the number of Ordinary 
Shares in issue, the Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the 
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such consolidation, 
reclassification, redesignation or subdivision by the following fraction:
where:
A is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately before such consolidation, reclassification, 
redesignation or subdivision, as the case may be; and
B is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately after, and as a result of, such consolidation, 
reclassification, redesignation or subdivision, as the case may 
be.
Such adjustment will become effective on the date on which the 
consolidation, reclassification, redesignation or subdivision, as the case 
may be, takes effect.
(B) If UBS Group AG issues any Ordinary Shares to Shareholders as a class 
credited as fully paid by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves 
(including any share premium account or capital redemption reserve) 
other than (x) where any such Ordinary Shares are or are to be issued 
instead of the whole or part of a Cash Distribution that the Shareholders 
would or could otherwise have elected to receive, (y) where the 
Shareholders may elect to receive a Cash Distribution in lieu of such 
Ordinary Shares or (z) where any such Ordinary Shares are or are 
expressed to be issued in lieu of a dividend (whether or not a Cash 
Distribution equivalent or amount is announced or would otherwise be 
payable to the Shareholders, whether at their election or otherwise), the 
Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price 
in force immediately prior to such issue by the following fraction:
10272790607-v17 97 70-41061831
where:
A is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately before such issue; and
B is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately after such issue.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of issue of such 
Ordinary Shares.
(C) If UBS Group AG makes or pays an Extraordinary Distribution to 
Shareholders, the Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the 
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the Effective Date by the 
following fraction:
where:
A is the Current Market Price of one Ordinary Share on the 
Effective Date (translated, if necessary, into the Relevant 
Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the Effective Date); and
B is the portion of the aggregate Extraordinary Distribution 
attributable to one Ordinary Share, with such portion being 
determined by dividing the aggregate Extraordinary 
Distribution by the number of Ordinary Shares entitled to 
receive the relevant Extraordinary Distribution. If the 
Extraordinary Distribution shall be expressed in a currency 
other than the Relevant Currency, it shall be converted into the 
Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the relevant 
Effective Date.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date.
For purposes of this subclause (C), "Effective Date" means (x) the first 
date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-the Extraordinary 
Distribution on the Relevant Stock Exchange or (y) if there is no 
Relevant Stock Exchange, the first date upon which the adjusted 
Conversion Price is capable of being determined in accordance with this 
subclause (C).
(D) If UBS Group AG issues Ordinary Shares to Shareholders as a class by 
way of rights or UBS Group AG or any other member of the Group or 
(at the direction or request or pursuant to arrangements with UBS Group 
AG or any other member of the Group) any other Person issues or grants 
to Shareholders as a class by way of rights, any options, warrants or other 
rights to subscribe for or purchase Ordinary Shares, or any Securities that 
by their terms of issue carry (directly or indirectly) rights of conversion 
into, or exchange or subscription for, any Ordinary Shares (or shall grant 
any such rights in respect of existing Securities so issued), in each case 
at a price per Ordinary Share that is less than 95 per cent. of the Current 
Market Price per Ordinary Share on the Effective Date (translated, if 
necessary, into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the 
Effective Date), the Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the 
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the Effective Date by the 
following fraction:
10272790607-v17 98 70-41061831
where:
A is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue on the Effective Date;
B is the number of Ordinary Shares that the aggregate 
consideration (if any) receivable for the Ordinary Shares issued 
by way of rights, or for the Securities issued by way of rights, 
or for the options or warrants or other rights issued by way of 
rights and for the total number of Ordinary Shares deliverable 
on the exercise thereof, would purchase at such Current Market 
Price per Ordinary Share on the Effective Date (translated, if 
necessary, into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on 
the Effective Date); and
C is the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or the maximum 
number of Ordinary Shares that may be issued upon exercise of 
such options, warrants or rights calculated as at the date of issue 
of such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion or 
exchange or exercise of rights of subscription or purchase in 
respect thereof at the initial conversion, exchange, subscription 
or purchase price or rate, as the case may be,
provided that, if on the Effective Date, such number of Ordinary Shares 
is to be determined by reference to the application of a formula or other 
variable feature or the occurrence of any event at some subsequent time, 
then for the purposes of this subclause (D), "C" will be determined by the 
application of such formula or variable feature or as if the relevant event 
occurs or had occurred as at the Effective Date and as if such conversion, 
exchange, subscription, purchase or acquisition had taken place on the 
Effective Date.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date.
For purposes of this subclause (D), "Effective Date" means (x) the first 
date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-rights, ex-options or exwarrants on the Relevant Stock Exchange or (y) if there is no Relevant 
Stock Exchange, the first date upon which the adjusted Conversion Price 
is capable of being determined in accordance with this subclause (D).
For purposes of any calculation of the consideration receivable or price 
pursuant to this subclause (D), the following provisions shall apply:
(1) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary 
Shares issued for cash shall be the amount of such cash;
(2) (x) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary 
Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the 
conversion or exchange of any Securities will be deemed to be 
the consideration or price received or receivable for any such 
Securities and (y) the aggregate consideration receivable or 
price for Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made 
available upon the exercise of rights of subscription attached to 
any Securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or 
rights will be deemed to be that part (which may be the whole) 
of the consideration or price received or receivable for such 
Securities or, as the case may be, for such options, warrants or 
rights that are attributed by UBS Group AG to such rights of 
subscription or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or 
rights or, if no part of such consideration or price is so attributed,
10272790607-v17 99 70-41061831
the Fair Market Value of such rights of subscription or, as the 
case may be, such options, warrants or rights as at the relevant 
Effective Date, plus in the case of each of subclauses (x) and (y) 
above, the additional minimum consideration receivable or price 
(if any) upon the conversion or exchange of such Securities, or 
upon the exercise of such rights or subscription attached thereto 
or, as the case may be, upon exercise of such options, warrants 
or rights, and (z) the consideration receivable or price per 
Ordinary Share upon the conversion or exchange of, or upon the 
exercise of such rights of subscription attached to, such 
Securities or, as the case may be, upon the exercise of such 
options, warrants or rights will be the aggregate consideration or 
price referred to in subclause (x) or (y) above (as the case may 
be) divided by the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued upon 
such conversion or exchange or exercise at the initial 
conversion, exchange or subscription price or rate;
(3) if the consideration or price determined pursuant to 
subclause (1) or (2) above (or any component thereof) is 
expressed in a currency other than the Relevant Currency, it shall 
be converted into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate 
on the relevant Effective Date (in the case of subclause (1) 
above) or the relevant date of first public announcement (in the 
case of subclause (2) above);
(4) in determining the consideration or price pursuant to the above, 
no deduction shall be made for any commissions or fees 
(howsoever described) or any expenses paid or incurred for any 
underwriting, placing or management of the issue of the relevant 
Ordinary Shares or Securities or options, warrants or rights, or 
otherwise in connection therewith; and
(5) the consideration or price shall be determined as provided above 
on the basis of the consideration or price received, receivable, 
paid or payable, regardless of whether all or part thereof is 
received, receivable, paid or payable by or to UBS Group AG or 
another entity.
(E) If UBS Group AG determines, in its sole discretion, that, notwithstanding 
subclauses (A) to (D) of this Condition 9(d)(i), a reduction to the 
Conversion Price should be made as a result of one or more events or 
circumstances not referred to in this Condition 9(d)(i) that would require 
an adjustment to the Conversion Price in order to comply with Swiss 
mandatory law on the protection of holders of instruments that may 
convert into shares issued out of capital range (Kapitalband), conditional 
capital (bedingtes Kapital) or Conversion Capital, the Conversion Price 
will be reduced (either generally or for a specified period) in such manner 
and with effect from such date as UBS Group AG shall determine and 
the Issuer shall notify to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices).
(ii) Notwithstanding Condition 9(d)(i):
(A) where
(1) the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment to the 
Conversion Price have resulted or will result in an adjustment to 
the Conversion Price; or
(2) more than one event that gives rise to an adjustment to the 
Conversion Price occurs within such a short period of time,
10272790607-v17 100 70-41061831
that, in the opinion of UBS Group AG, a modification to the 
operation of the adjustment provisions set forth in this Condition 
9(d) is required to give the intended result, such modification 
will be made to the operation of the adjustment provisions set 
forth in this Condition 9(d) as may be determined by an 
Independent Adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to give the 
intended result, including to ensure that (x) an adjustment to the 
Conversion Price or the economic effect thereof shall not be 
taken into account more than once, (y) the economic effect of an 
Extraordinary Distribution is not taken into account more than 
once, and (z) to reflect a redenomination of the issued Ordinary 
Shares for the time being into a new currency;
(B) any adjustment to the Conversion Price will be subject to such 
Conversion Price not being less than the par value of an Ordinary Share 
at such time (currently USD 0.10);
(C) UBS Group AG shall not take any action, and shall procure that no action 
is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Conversion 
Price to below the par value of an Ordinary Share then in effect;
(D) if any doubt arises as to whether an adjustment is to be made to the 
Conversion Price or as to the appropriate adjustment to the Conversion 
Price, UBS Group AG may in its sole discretion appoint an Independent 
Adviser and, following consultation between UBS Group AG and such 
Independent Adviser, a written opinion of such Independent Adviser in 
respect thereof will (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith and 
manifest error) be conclusive and binding on UBS Group AG and the 
Holders;
(E) no adjustment will be made to the Conversion Price where Ordinary 
Shares or other securities (including rights, warrants and options) are 
issued, offered, exercised, allotted, purchased, appropriated, modified or 
granted to, or for the benefit of, employees or former employees 
(including directors holding or formerly holding executive office or the 
personal service company of any such person) or their spouses or 
relatives, in each case, of UBS Group AG or any of its subsidiaries or 
any associated company or to a trustee or trustees to be held for the 
benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to any share or 
option scheme; and
(F) on any adjustment, if the resultant Conversion Price has more decimal 
places than the initial Conversion Price, it will be rounded to the same 
number of decimal places as the initial Conversion Price. No adjustment 
will be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded 
down if applicable) would be less than one per cent. of the Conversion 
Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any 
amount by which the Conversion Price has been rounded down, will be 
carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and 
such subsequent adjustment will be made on the basis that the adjustment 
not required to be made had been made at the relevant time and/or that 
the relevant rounding down had not been made, as the case may be.
(iii) The Issuer shall give notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price made 
pursuant to this Condition 9(d) to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices) promptly after the determination thereof.
(iv) References in these Terms and Conditions to any issue or offer or grant to 
Shareholders "as a class" or "by way of rights" shall be taken to be references to 
an issue or offer or grant to all or substantially all Shareholders, other than 
Shareholders to whom, by reason of the laws of any territory or requirements of 
any recognised regulatory body or any other stock exchange or securities market
10272790607-v17 101 70-41061831
in any territory or in connection with fractional entitlements, it is determined not 
to make such issue or offer or grant.
(e) Qualifying Relevant Event
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Relevant Event that is a Qualifying Relevant Event, 
then:
(A) upon the occurrence of a Conversion Event where the applicable 
Conversion Date falls on or after the New Conversion Condition 
Effective Date,
(1) the Notes shall be converted on such Conversion Date into, or 
be exchanged on such Conversion Date for, as the case may be, 
Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity, mutatis mutandis as 
provided in accordance with this Condition 9, at a Conversion 
Price that shall be the New Conversion Price; and
(2) the Issuer shall procure the issue and/or delivery of the relevant 
number of Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity in the manner 
provided in this Condition 9 (as may be amended as described 
in the definition of the term New Conversion Condition); and
(B) the New Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment in the 
circumstances provided in this Condition 9 for the adjustment of the 
Conversion Price (if necessary with such amendments as an Independent 
Adviser shall determine to be appropriate) and the Issuer shall give notice 
in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) to the Holders of the New 
Conversion Price and of any such amendments thereafter.
(ii) Upon the occurrence of a Relevant Event, the Issuer shall give notice thereof to 
the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) within 10 Business Days 
following the occurrence of such Relevant Event, which notice shall:
(A) specify the identity of the Acquiror;
(B) specify whether the Relevant Event is a Qualifying Relevant Event or a 
Non-Qualifying Relevant Event;
(C) in the case of a Qualifying Relevant Event, specify the New Conversion 
Price; and
(D) if applicable, specify the New Conversion Condition Effective Date.
(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, upon the occurrence of a Relevant Event that is a 
Non-Qualifying Relevant Event, the provisions of this clause (e) shall (subject to 
the subsequent operation of this clause (e) upon the occurrence of a subsequent 
Relevant Event) not apply, and the Notes will continue to be convertible into 
Ordinary Shares pursuant to and in accordance with the other provisions of this 
Condition 9 (Conversion), if and when the Issuer gives a Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice or a Viability Event Conversion Notice in accordance with 
Condition 7 (Trigger Event and Viability Event).
(iv) For purposes of these Terms and Conditions:
"Acquiror" means the Person (including a Governmental Entity) that, following 
a Relevant Event, controls UBS Group AG.
"Approved Entity" means an Acquiror that is body corporate that is 
incorporated or established under the laws of an OECD member state and that, 
on the occurrence of the Relevant Event, has in issue Relevant Shares.
10272790607-v17 102 70-41061831
"Governmental Entity" means (x) the Swiss Confederation, (y) an agency of the 
Swiss Confederation or (z) a person or entity (other than a body corporate) 
controlled by the Swiss Confederation or any such agency referred to in clause (y); 
provided, however, that, if UBS Group AG is at any time organised in a 
jurisdiction outside of Switzerland, references in this definition to "the Swiss 
Confederation" shall be read as references to the government of such other 
jurisdiction.
The "New Conversion Condition" shall be satisfied in respect of a Relevant 
Event if, by no later than seven days following the occurrence of such Relevant 
Event, (x) UBS Group AG has, to the satisfaction of UBS Group AG, entered into 
arrangements with the Approved Entity that provide for delivery of Relevant 
Shares of the Approved Entity on Conversion on terms mutatis mutandis as 
provided in the provisions of this Condition 9, and (y) the Issuer has entered into 
such agreements and arrangements, and made such amendments to these Terms 
and Conditions, as may be required to ensure that, with effect from the New 
Conversion Condition Effective Date, the Notes shall, following the occurrence of 
a Conversion Event, be convertible into, or exchangeable for, Relevant Shares of 
the Approved Entity, mutatis mutandis in accordance with, and subject to, this 
Condition 9 (as may be so amended) at the New Conversion Price; provided, 
however, that, any failure to enter into the arrangements and agreements and/or 
make the amendments described in clauses (x) and (y) shall not constitute a 
default or an Event of Default under these Terms and Conditions.
"New Conversion Condition Effective Date" means the date with effect from 
which the New Conversion Condition has been satisfied.
"New Conversion Price" means, in respect of any Conversion Date falling on or 
after the New Conversion Condition Effective Date, the amount determined by the 
Issuer in accordance with the following formula:
where:
NCP is the New Conversion Price.
ECP is the Conversion Price in effect on the last dealing day prior 
to the New Conversion Condition Effective Date.
VWAPRS is the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the 
Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity (translated, if 
necessary, into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate 
on the relevant dealing day) on each of the five dealing days 
ending on the last dealing day prior to the date on which the 
Relevant Event occurred (and where references in the 
definition of "Volume Weighted Average Price" to 
"Ordinary Shares" shall be construed as a reference to the 
Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity and in the definition 
of "dealing day", references to the "Relevant Stock 
Exchange" shall be to the primary Recognised Stock 
Exchange on which the Relevant Shares of the Approved 
Entity are then listed, admitted to trading or accepted for 
dealing).
VWAPOS is the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the 
Ordinary Shares (translated, if necessary, into the Relevant 
Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the relevant dealing day) 
on each of the five dealing days ending on
10272790607-v17 103 70-41061831
the last dealing day prior to the date on which the Relevant 
Event occurred.
"Non-Qualifying Relevant Event" means a Relevant Event that is not a 
Qualifying Relevant Event.
"Qualifying Relevant Event" means a Relevant Event where:
(A) the Acquiror is an Approved Entity; and
(B) the New Conversion Condition is satisfied.
A "Relevant Event" will have occurred if, on or after the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, any Person or Persons acting in concert 
acquires control of UBS Group AG (other than as a result of an Exempt 
Reorganisation). For the purposes of this definition "Relevant Event", "control" 
means the acquisition or holding of legal or beneficial ownership of more than 95 
per cent. of the issued Ordinary Shares of UBS Group AG (whether obtained 
directly or indirectly and whether obtained by ownership of share capital, contract 
or otherwise) and, as a consequence thereof, the Ordinary Shares are no longer 
admitted to trading on any Recognised Stock Exchange, and "controlled" shall be 
construed accordingly.
"Relevant Shares" means, in respect of an Acquiror, ordinary share capital of 
such Acquiror that constitutes equity share capital or the equivalent (or depositary 
or other receipts representing the same) that is listed and admitted to trading on a 
Recognised Stock Exchange.
(f) Procedure for settlement and delivery of Ordinary Shares on Conversion
Ordinary Shares to be issued on Conversion shall be delivered subject to and as provided 
below.
(g) Fractions
Fractions of Ordinary Shares will not be issued or delivered pursuant to these Terms and 
Conditions on Conversion and no cash payment will be made in lieu thereof. The number 
of Ordinary Shares to be issued and delivered to the Settlement Share Depository for the 
benefit of each Holder in respect of a Conversion shall be calculated by the Settlement 
Agent on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by such Holder on the 
applicable Conversion Date and rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number 
of Ordinary Shares.
(h) Procedure for delivery in respect of a Conversion
(i) UBS Group AG, with the assistance of the Settlement Agent where necessary 
under Swiss law, shall on or prior to the applicable Conversion Date issue and 
deliver to the Settlement Share Depository such number of Ordinary Shares as is 
required to satisfy in full its obligation to deliver Ordinary Shares to the Holders 
in respect of the Conversion on the applicable Conversion Date. Receipt by the 
Settlement Share Depository of such Ordinary Shares shall be a good and 
complete discharge of the Issuer's (and, if UBS Group AG is not the Issuer, UBS 
Group AG's) obligations in respect of the Notes. If the Issuer is unable to appoint 
a Settlement Share Depository on or prior to the giving of the Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice, as the case may be, it 
shall make such other arrangements for the issuance and delivery of the Ordinary 
Shares to be issued and delivered upon Conversion to the Holders as it considers, 
in its sole discretion, to be reasonable in the circumstances, which may include 
issuing and delivering such Ordinary Shares to another independent nominee to 
be held on trust for the Holders or issuing and delivering such Ordinary Shares to 
the Holders directly, which issuance and delivery shall irrevocably discharge and 
satisfy all of the Issuer's obligations under the Notes as if the relevant Ordinary
10272790607-v17 104 70-41061831
Shares had been issued and delivered to the Settlement Share Depository and, in 
which case, where the context so admits, references in these Terms and 
Conditions to the issue and delivery of Ordinary Shares to the Settlement Share 
Depository shall be construed accordingly and apply mutatis mutandis.
(ii) Subject to the making of a Settlement Shares Offer and as otherwise provided 
herein, the Settlement Agent shall give instructions to the Settlement Share 
Depository for the relevant Ordinary Shares to be delivered by the Settlement 
Share Depository on the applicable Settlement Date to the Holders, and the 
Settlement Share Depository shall procure that the Ordinary Shares are so 
delivered to the Holders on the applicable Settlement Date.
(iii) In respect of a Conversion as a result of the occurrence of a Trigger Event only, 
following receipt by the Settlement Share Depository of the Ordinary Shares and 
the resulting good and complete discharge of the Issuer's obligations in respect of 
the Notes as described in subclause (i) above, the Issuer may, in its sole discretion, 
appoint a placement agent (the "Settlement Shares Offer Agent") acting on 
behalf, and for the accounts, of the Holders to conduct an offering of the Ordinary 
Shares to which the Holders are otherwise entitled (a "Settlement Shares 
Offer"). In the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice, the Issuer shall notify 
the Holders whether it will appoint such Settlement Shares Offer Agent to conduct 
such a Settlement Shares Offer. If it does so appoint a Settlement Shares Offer 
Agent, it will instruct the Settlement Share Depository to deliver the relevant 
Ordinary Shares to or to the order of the Settlement Shares Offer Agent for this 
purpose prior to the end of the Offer Settlement Period. Such Settlement Shares 
Offer shall be made (x) at a net price per Ordinary Share, which, translated into 
the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate at the date of the Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice, is equal to the Conversion Price in effect on the date of the 
Trigger Event Conversion Notice, and (y) to some or, subject to applicable laws 
and regulations and to such an offer being practicable in the opinion of the Issuer 
in the Offer Settlement Period, all Shareholders on the record date of the Trigger 
Event Conversion Notice then eligible to participate in such offer. Any such 
Settlement Shares Offer shall be completed no later than 20 Business Days after 
the occurrence of the Trigger Event (the "Offer Settlement Period"). Neither the 
Issuer nor the Settlement Share Depository shall incur any liability whatsoever to 
the Holders in respect of the appointment of such Settlement Shares Offer Agent 
or its conduct, save for cases of gross negligence or wilful intent.
If the Settlement Shares Offer is fully subscribed by or before the end of the Offer 
Settlement Period, Holders shall, pursuant to the agreement appointing the 
Settlement Shares Offer Agent, be entitled to receive from the Settlement Shares 
Offer Agent on the fifth Business Day after the end of the Offer Settlement Period, 
in respect of each Ordinary Share to which they were otherwise entitled, cash 
proceeds received from the Settlement Shares Offer in an amount equal to the 
Conversion Price in effect on the date of the Trigger Event Conversion Notice 
(translated, if necessary, into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate at the 
date of the Trigger Event Conversion Notice). If the Settlement Shares Offer is 
only partially subscribed by the end of the Offer Settlement Period, Holders shall 
in aggregate be entitled to receive on a pro rata basis (x) cash proceeds received 
from such Settlement Shares Offer in an amount equal to the Conversion Price in 
effect on the date of the Trigger Event Conversion Notice (translated, if necessary, 
into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate at the date of the Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice) multiplied by the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares sold 
on the fifth Business Day after the end of the Offer Settlement Period from the 
Settlement Shares Offer Agent, pursuant to the agreement appointing the 
Settlement Shares Offer Agent, and rounding the resulting figure to the nearest 
sub-unit of the Relevant Currency (one half of any such sub-unit being rounded 
upwards), together with (y) the number of Ordinary Shares not subscribed 
pursuant to the Settlement Shares Offer within the period specified below from the 
Settlement Share Depository. If no Ordinary Shares are subscribed in the 
Settlement Shares Offer, Holders shall be entitled to receive the relevant Ordinary
10272790607-v17 105 70-41061831
Shares within the period specified below from the Settlement Share Depository. 
Notwithstanding Condition 10 (Payments; Agents), any cash proceeds that the 
Holders are entitled to receive pursuant to this subclause (iii) shall be delivered to 
the Holders in accordance with clause (j) of this Condition 9.
In relation to any Ordinary Shares not sold pursuant to a Settlement Shares Offer, 
the Settlement Agent shall give instructions to the Settlement Shares Offer Agent 
for such Ordinary Shares to be delivered by the Settlement Shares Offer Agent to 
the relevant Holders within five Business Days after the end of the Offer 
Settlement Period.
(i) Taxes and duties
None of the Issuer, any other member of the Group, any Agent, the Settlement Share 
Depository and the US Transfer Agent will pay any capital, stamp, issue, registration, 
transfer or other taxes or duties arising upon Conversion or that may arise or be paid as a 
consequence of or in connection with the issue and delivery of Ordinary Shares to the 
Settlement Share Depository or the delivery of any Ordinary Shares to the relevant 
recipient in accordance with the instructions given in the relevant Settlement Shares 
Settlement Notice. A Holder must pay any capital, stamp, issue, registration, transfer or 
other taxes or duties arising upon Conversion or that may arise or be paid as a consequence 
of or in connection with the issue and delivery of the Ordinary Shares to the Settlement 
Share Depository or the delivery of the Ordinary Shares to the relevant recipient in 
accordance with the instructions given in the relevant Settlement Shares Settlement 
Notice, and such Holder must pay all, if any, such taxes and duties arising by reference to 
any disposal or deemed disposal of such Holder's Notes or interest therein. Any capital, 
stamp, issue, registration, transfer or other taxes or duties arising on delivery or transfer 
of Ordinary Shares to a purchaser in any Settlement Shares Offer shall be payable by the 
relevant purchaser of those Ordinary Shares.
(j) Delivery of Ordinary Shares and cash proceeds received from a Settlement Shares Offer
UBS Group AG, with the assistance of the Settlement Agent where necessary under Swiss 
law, will issue and deliver the Ordinary Shares required to be issued and delivered on 
Conversion to the Settlement Share Depository on behalf of the Holder of the relevant 
Note(s). The Issuer (or another party so authorised by the Issuer) shall instruct the US 
Transfer Agent to credit such Ordinary Shares to a nominee account in the name of the 
Settlement Share Depository to be held on behalf of the Holders on the applicable 
Conversion Date. Receipt by the Settlement Share Depository of such Ordinary Shares on 
the applicable Conversion Date shall be a good and complete discharge of the Issuer's 
obligations in respect of the Notes as described in subclause (h)(i) of this Condition 9.
In order to obtain delivery from the Settlement Share Depository of the Ordinary Shares 
and/or cash proceeds received from a Settlement Shares Offer, in each case to which it is 
entitled pursuant to this Condition 9, a Holder will be required to deliver to the Settlement 
Share Depository (or any of its agent designated for such purpose in the Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice, as applicable) an executed 
settlement shares settlement notice substantially in the form that may be obtained from the 
Specified Office of the Settlement Agent (a "Settlement Shares Settlement Notice") and 
the relevant Certificate representing the relevant Note to the Settlement Share Depository 
(or any of its agents designated for such purpose in the Trigger Event Conversion Notice 
or Viability Event Conversion Notice) on or before the Settlement Notice Cut-off Date. If 
such Settlement Shares Settlement Notice or Certificate is delivered after the end of 
normal business hours at the Specified Office of the Settlement Share Depository, such 
delivery shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made or given on the following 
New York Business Day. The Settlement Shares Settlement Notice must contain certain 
information, including the name of the relevant recipient in which the relevant Ordinary 
Shares are to be registered directly on the books of the US Transfer, and Settlement Shares 
Settlement Notices and Certificates must be delivered to the Settlement Share Depository 
(or any of its agents designated for such purpose in the Trigger Event Conversion Notice 
or Viability Event Conversion Notice, as applicable) in accordance with the procedures
10272790607-v17 106 70-41061831
described in the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion 
Notice, as applicable; provided, however, that, if the Notes are represented by one or more 
Global Certificates deposited with, or with a custodian for, the Depositary, then the 
Settlement Shares Settlement Notice must be given in accordance with the standard 
procedures of the Depositary (which may include, without limitation, delivery of the 
notice to the Settlement Share Depository by electronic means) and in a form acceptable 
to the Depositary, the Settlement Agent and the Settlement Share Depository. Subject as 
otherwise provided herein, the relevant Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds of a 
Settlement Shares Offer will be delivered by or on behalf of the Settlement Share 
Depository or the Settlement Shares Offer Agent, as applicable, in accordance with the 
instructions given in the relevant Settlement Shares Settlement Notice; provided, however, 
that, if the Notes are represented by one or more Global Certificates deposited with, or 
with a custodian for, the Depositary, then delivery of any such cash proceeds shall be made 
by the Settlement Shares Offer Agent in accordance with the Depositary's practices from 
time to time.
If a Holder delivers a valid Settlement Shares Settlement Notice and the relevant 
Certificate on or before the Settlement Notice Cut-off Date, then the Ordinary Shares will 
be delivered in respect of the relevant Note(s) by way of registering the Ordinary Shares in 
the name of the relevant recipient directly on the books of the US Transfer Agent on the 
applicable Settlement Date or such other date as is specified for delivery. Once Ordinary 
Shares are registered in the name of the relevant recipient directly on the books of the US 
Transfer Agent, such relevant recipient, as Shareholder, is expected to receive periodic 
account statements from the US Transfer Agent with respect to its Ordinary Shares. At the 
time of delivery of any Ordinary Shares to the relevant recipient by registration of such 
Ordinary Shares directly on the books of the US Transfer Agent, the then-valid share 
registration rules of UBS Group AG will apply, and UBS Group AG does not offer any 
assurance or guarantee that such relevant recipient will be accepted as a Shareholder with 
voting rights in the share register of UBS Group AG.
If a Holder fails to deliver a Settlement Shares Settlement Notice or the relevant Certificate 
on or before the Settlement Notice Cut-off Date or if a Holder has delivered a Settlement 
Shares Settlement Notice and the relevant Certificate on or prior the Settlement Notice 
Cut-off Date but such Settlement Shares Settlement Notice has been determined by the 
Settlement Share Depository to be null and void, then the Settlement Share Depository 
shall continue to hold the relevant Ordinary Shares and/or, as applicable, cash proceeds 
received from a Settlement Shares Offer, in each case to which such Holder is entitled 
pursuant to this Condition 9, until a valid Settlement Shares Settlement Notice (and the 
Certificate representing the relevant Notes) is so delivered by such Holder. If any such 
Ordinary Shares or such cash proceeds received from a Settlement Shares Offer (as 
applicable) have not been claimed during the 10-year and 30-day period commencing on 
the Final Cancellation Date, the relevant claims of the applicable Holders are time-barred 
and the relevant Ordinary Shares and cash, as the case may be, will be transferred to the 
Issuer. None of the Issuer, the Settlement Share Depository and the Settlement Shares 
Offer Agent shall have any liability to any Holder for any loss resulting from such Holder 
not receiving any such Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds.
If not previously cancelled on the applicable Settlement Date, the relevant Notes shall be 
cancelled on the Final Cancellation Date and any Holder delivering a Settlement Shares 
Settlement Notice after the Settlement Notice Cut-off Date will have to provide evidence 
of its entitlement to the relevant Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds from a Settlement 
Shares Offer, as applicable, satisfactory to the Settlement Share Depository in its sole 
discretion in order to receive delivery of such Ordinary Shares or such cash proceeds, as 
applicable. None of the Issuer, the Settlement Share Depository and the Settlement Shares 
Offer Agent shall have any liability to any Holder for any loss resulting from such Holder 
not receiving any Ordinary Shares or cash proceeds from a Settlement Shares Offer, as 
applicable, or from any delay in the receipt thereof, in each case as a result of such Holder 
failing to submit a valid Settlement Shares Settlement Notice and any relevant Certificate 
(if applicable), on a timely basis or at all.
10272790607-v17 107 70-41061831
Any determination as to whether any Settlement Shares Settlement Notice has been 
properly completed and delivered together with the relevant Certificate(s) as provided in 
these Terms and Conditions, or whether any evidence of entitlement to Ordinary Shares or 
cash proceeds received from a Settlement Shares Offer, as applicable, is satisfactory, shall 
be made by the Settlement Share Depository in its sole discretion and shall be conclusive 
and binding on the relevant Holders. In the case of Notes represented by a Global 
Certificate, any Settlement Shares Settlement Notice delivered prior to the day following 
the Suspension Date will be null and void.
(k) Ordinary Shares
The Ordinary Shares issued and delivered on Conversion will be fully paid and nonassessable and will in all respects rank pari passu with the fully paid Ordinary Shares in 
issue on the relevant Share Creation Date, except in any such case for any right excluded 
by mandatory provisions of applicable law, and except that the Ordinary Shares so issued 
and delivered will not rank for (or, as the case may be, the relevant Holder will not be 
entitled to receive) any rights, distributions or payments the record date or other due date 
for the establishment of entitlement for which falls prior to the relevant Share Creation 
Date.
All Ordinary Shares issued and delivered to Holders upon Conversion are expected to be 
"restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the US Securities Act, and 
accordingly, any Holder who receives Ordinary Shares upon Conversion will be subject 
to restrictions under the US Securities Act on its ability to resell such Ordinary Shares. 
Subject to applicable law and the policies and procedures of the US Transfer Agent from 
time to time, through the US Transfer Agent, Holders who receive Ordinary Shares upon 
Conversion are expected to be able to effect transfers of such Ordinary Shares with other 
Shareholders holding their Ordinary Shares through the US Transfer Agent, or with 
Shareholders holding their Ordinary Shares via DTC through custodian banks or brokers 
by means of DTC's Direct Registration System.
(l) Purchase or redemption of Ordinary Shares
UBS Group AG or any of its subsidiaries may exercise such rights as it may from time to 
time enjoy to purchase or redeem or buy back any shares or securities of UBS Group AG 
(including Ordinary Shares) or any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing 
the same without the consent of Holders.
(m) Determinations to be made by an Independent Adviser
In the case of any determination that is required to be made by an Independent Adviser 
under these Terms and Conditions, the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint 
an Independent Adviser to make such determination; provided, however, that, 
notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions, if the Issuer is unable 
to so appoint an Independent Adviser or the Independent Adviser so appointed by the 
Issuer fails to make such determination, the Issuer, acting in good faith and a commercially 
reasonable manner, will make such determination.
Any determination that is made by an Independent Adviser under these Terms and 
Conditions will be made in the sole discretion of such Independent Adviser acting in good 
faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
(n) Notifications, etc. to be final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and 
decisions given, expressed, made or obtained by an Independent Adviser or the Settlement 
Agent for purposes of this Condition 9 will (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith and 
manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Agents and the Holders and (in the absence 
of wilful default and bad faith) no liability to the Issuer or the Holders will attach to the 
Independent Adviser or the Settlement Agent in connection with the exercise or non-
10272790607-v17 108 70-41061831
exercise by the Independent Adviser or the Settlement Agent of its powers, duties and 
discretions under this Condition 9.
10. PAYMENTS; AGENTS
(a) All payments required to be made under the Notes will be made available in good time 
in freely disposable funds in USD, which will be placed at the free disposal of the Fiscal 
Agent on behalf of the Holders. If the Scheduled Due Date for any payment (whether in 
respect of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of the Notes is not a Payment 
Business Day, then the Holders will not be entitled to payment thereof until the first 
Payment Business Day following the Scheduled Due Date, and the Holders will not be 
entitled to any additional sum in relation to such payment. All payments required to be 
made under the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Additional Amounts) 
shall be made to the Holders in USD without collection costs, without any restrictions 
and whatever the circumstances may be, irrespective of nationality, domicile or 
residence of the relevant Holder and without certification, affidavit or the fulfilment of 
any other formality; provided, however, that, in the case of Notes represented by 
Definitive Certificates, such Definitive Certificates must be presented and, in the case of 
redemption, surrendered at the Specified Office of the relevant Paying Agent as a 
condition to receipt of any such payment.
(b) The receipt by the Fiscal Agent of the due and punctual payment of funds in USD will 
release the Issuer from its obligations under the Notes to the extent of such payment.
Subject to clause (d) of this Condition 10:
(i) the Issuer reserves the right to terminate the appointment of any Agent, as well as 
to appoint or, after any such appointment, to terminate the appointment of, one or 
more other paying agents to carry out any payment, calculation or other functions 
in respect of the Notes (each, a "Paying Agent"), provided that (A) so long as any 
Note is outstanding, there will at all times be a Fiscal Agent, a Registrar, a 
Calculation Agent and a Settlement Agent, (B) for so long as the Notes are listed 
on the SIX Swiss Exchange and if then required by the regulations of the SIX 
Swiss Exchange, the Issuer shall maintain a Paying Agent in Switzerland, which 
agent shall have an office in Switzerland and be a bank or securities dealer subject 
to supervision by FINMA, to perform the functions of a Swiss paying agent (the 
"Swiss Paying Agent"), and (C) any successor Calculation Agent must be a 
leading bank or financial institution that is experienced in the calculations and 
determinations to be made by the Calculation Agent; and
(ii) if at any time the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar, the Calculation Agent, or the Swiss 
Paying Agent, (A) becomes incapable of acting, or (B) is adjudged bankrupt or 
insolvent, or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or makes an assignment for 
the benefit of its creditors, or consents to the appointment of a receiver of all or 
any substantial part of its property, or admits in writing its inability to pay or meet 
its debts as they mature, or if an order of any court is entered approving any 
petition filed by or against it under the provisions of any applicable bankruptcy 
or insolvency law, or if a receiver of it or of all or any substantial part of its 
property is appointed, or if any public officer takes charge or control of it or of its 
property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation 
(any such event, an "Agent Insolvency Event"), then the Issuer will terminate 
the appointment of such Agent in accordance with the Fiscal Agency Agreement 
and appoint a successor Agent; and
(iii) if at any time the Calculation Agent fails to (A) determine the Treasury Yield or 
the Reset Interest Rate or duly calculate the Reset Interest Amount for any Reset 
Interest Period or the interest amount payable on the Redemption Date (if the 
Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to Condition 6 (Redemption and Purchase)) 
or (B) comply with any other requirement in relation to the Notes, then the Issuer 
will terminate the appointment of the Calculation Agent in accordance with the 
Fiscal Agency Agreement and appoint a successor Calculation Agent; provided,
10272790607-v17 109 70-41061831
however, that, if the Calculation Agent duly calculates such Reset Interest Rate, 
Reset Interest Amount or interest amount payable on the Redemption Date, as 
the case may be, prior to its termination (and the appointment of its successor) 
taking effect in accordance with clause (d) of this Condition 10, the Issuer may 
elect, in its sole discretion and upon notice to the Holders in accordance with 
Condition 15 (Notices), to cancel such termination (and appointment).
(c) Any appointment or termination of appointment of, or any resignation by, any Agent 
(other than the Settlement Agent) may only take effect not more than 45 and not less than 
30 days after the Issuer has notified the Holders of such appointment, termination or 
resignation in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices); provided, however, that, in the case 
of the termination of an Agent with respect to which an Agent Insolvency Event has 
occurred, such termination may take effect prior to the expiry of such 30-day notice period, 
so long as a successor Agent has been appointed to the extent required by the immediately 
succeeding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any termination of the appointment 
of, or resignation by, the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar, the Swiss Paying Agent or the 
Calculation Agent may not take effect until the Issuer has appointed a successor Fiscal 
Agent, Registrar, Swiss Paying Agent or Calculation Agent, as applicable; provided, 
however, that, if no such successor has been appointed within 30 days of the scheduled 
effectiveness of such termination or resignation, any Holder (on behalf of itself and all 
others similarly situated) or, pursuant to and in accordance with the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement, the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar, any Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, 
as the case may be, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment 
of a successor, at the expense of the Issuer.
(d) Subject to subclause (c)(i) of this Condition 10, the Issuer may appoint or terminate the 
appointment of a Settlement Agent, and a Settlement Agent may resign, at any time. The 
Issuer will notify the Holders of any such appointment, termination or resignation in 
accordance with Condition 15 (Notices).
11. TAXATION
(a) All payments to be made by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Notes (including, 
for the avoidance of doubt, payments by a Paying Agent) shall be made without 
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, 
assessments or other government charges of any nature ("Taxes") imposed, levied, 
collected, withheld or assessed by or on behalf of any Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof or any authority of or in a Tax Jurisdiction or any political subdivision 
thereof having the power to impose, levy, collect, withhold or assess Taxes, unless 
withholding, deduction or accounting for such Taxes is required by law.
(b) In the event that any payment to be made by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the 
Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payments by a Paying Agent) is subject to 
any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes by requirement of law in a 
Tax Jurisdiction (as determined by the relevant tax authority of or in such Tax 
Jurisdiction), the Issuer shall pay such additional amounts as will result in the Holders 
receiving the amounts that they would have received in respect of the Notes if no such 
withholding or deduction had been required ("Additional Amounts").
(c) No Additional Amounts will be payable pursuant to clause (b) of this Condition 11 in 
relation to any Note:
(i) if the relevant Holder is liable for such Taxes on such Note as a result of having 
some connection with the relevant Tax Jurisdiction other than its mere ownership 
or possession of such Note or the receipt of principal or interest in respect thereof; 
or
(ii) if such Taxes are a result of such Note having been presented for payment (where 
presentment is required) more than 30 days after the Relevant Date, except to the 
extent that the Holder would have been entitled to receive the Additional Amounts 
if it had presented such Note for payment on the last day of the 30-day period; or
10272790607-v17 110 70-41061831
(iii) with respect to any Tax collected pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the 
US Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"), the regulations 
promulgated thereunder, or applicable inter-governmental agreements or 
agreements with the United States Internal Revenue Service entered into in 
connection with the implementation of such sections of the Code, or legislation 
enacted by a non-United States jurisdiction in connection with the implementation 
of such sections of the Code (FATCA); or]
(iv) where such withholding or deduction is required to be made pursuant to laws 
enacted by Switzerland providing for the taxation of payments according to 
principles similar to those laid down in the draft legislation of the Swiss Federal 
Council of 3 April 2020, or otherwise changing the Swiss federal withholding tax 
system from an issuer-based system to a paying agent-based system pursuant to 
which a Person other than the issuer is required to withhold tax on any interest 
payments; or
(v) to the extent any combination of subclauses (i) through (iv) of this clause (c) 
applies.
(d) Any reference in these Terms and Conditions to amounts payable by the Issuer in respect 
of the Notes includes (i) any Additional Amount payable pursuant to this Condition 11 
and (ii) any sum payable pursuant to an obligation taken in addition to or in substitution 
for the obligation in this Condition 11.

become time-barred after the 10-year period, in each case, commencing on the date on which such 
payments, repayment or redemption become due and payable.
13. EVENTS OF DEFAULT
(a) If any of the following events occurs, such occurrence will constitute an "Event of 
Default":
(i) the Issuer fails to pay the principal amount of any Note if and when the same 
becomes due and payable under these Terms and Conditions, and such failure 
continues unremedied for a period of 30 days; or
(ii) the Issuer fails to pay any interest on the Notes if and when the same becomes 
due and payable under these Terms and Conditions, and such failure continues 
unremedied for a period of 30 days; or
(iii) the Issuer fails to observe or perform any other covenant, condition, or agreement 
contained in these Terms and Conditions, and such failure continues unremedied 
for a period of 60 days after written notice thereof from any Holder to the Issuer; 
or
(iv) a Bankruptcy Event;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding subclauses (i) to (iv) above, neither (A) the 
opening of Restructuring Proceedings with respect to the Issuer nor (B) the exercise of 
any Swiss Resolution Power with respect to the Issuer during any such Restructuring 
Proceedings nor (C) the ordering of any Protective Measures with respect to the Issuer that 
are ordered or confirmed upon the opening of or during any such Restructuring 
Proceedings will constitute a default or an Event of Default.
(b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to any failure of the Issuer to meet 
any payment obligation under these Terms and Conditions and subject to Condition 8 
(Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), (i) such payment obligation (and 
such payment obligation only) will be immediately deemed a due and payable (fällige)
10272790607-v17 111 70-41061831
payment obligation of the Issuer, and (ii) if (A) the relevant Holder has formally requested 
payment of such payment obligation, (B) such payment obligation has not been fulfilled 
within the statutory period under Swiss law commencing after the date of such formal 
request and (C) a writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl) has been issued with respect to such 
payment obligation pursuant to the DEBA, the relevant Holder may institute proceedings 
against the Issuer in Switzerland (but not elsewhere) to enforce its rights with respect to 
such payment obligation under the DEBA.
(c) If a debt collection or insolvency proceeding with respect to the Issuer is instituted in 
Switzerland in accordance with clause (b) of this Condition 13, the Issuer shall not (i) after 
having received the writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl) relating to the relevant payment 
obligation, argue or plead that such payment obligation is not due and payable by the 
Issuer, or (ii) prior to the declaration of bankruptcy (or similar proceeding under Swiss 
insolvency laws), make any payment to the relevant Holder under or in connection with 
the Notes.
(d) In the case of any Event of Default arising under subclause (a)(iii) of this Condition 13 
and subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), any 
Holder may seek specific performance or damages with respect to such Event of Default 
pursuant to the Swiss Code if so entitled thereunder. Any such damage claim of any Holder 
will rank junior to the rights and claims of all holders of Senior Obligations.
(e) In the case of any Event of Default arising under subclause (a)(iv) of this Condition 13 
and subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), any 
Holder may, by written notice to the Issuer, declare the principal amount of any of its 
Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, immediately due and 
payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind.
(f) No remedy against the Issuer other than those described in this Condition 13 will be 
available to the Holders in connection with the Issuer's obligations under these Terms and 
Conditions, whether for the recovery of amounts owing under these Terms and Conditions 
or in respect of any breach by the Issuer of any of its other obligations under these Terms 
and Conditions or otherwise. In particular, no Holder may declare (i) the principal amount 
of any Notes due and payable prior to any Redemption Date, or (ii) any interest on any 
Notes due and payable prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, except, in the case of 
each of subclauses (i) and (ii) of this clause (f), pursuant to clause (e) of this Condition 13.
14. MEETINGS OF HOLDERS; SUBSTITUTION AND AMENDMENT
(a) Except as otherwise specified in this Condition 14, the provisions of bondholder meetings 
contained in article 1157 et seqq. of the Swiss Code apply in relation to meetings of 
Holders.
(b) If a Tax Event or a Regulatory Event has occurred, the Issuer may, without the consent of 
the Holders, either substitute all, but not some only, of the Notes for, or amend these Terms 
and Conditions so that they remain or become, Compliant Securities, provided that:
(i) neither a Tax Event nor a Regulatory Event arises as a result of such substitution 
or amendment;
(ii) FINMA has approved such substitution or amendment (if such approval is then 
required under applicable Swiss laws and regulations);
(iii) the Issuer has given the Holders not less than 30 days' notice of such substitution 
or amendment in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices), which notice will, 
subject to subclause (v) of this clause (b), be irrevocable, and state the date on 
which such substitution or amendment will be effective (the "Substitution or 
Amendment Effective Date");
(iv) prior to the publication of any notice pursuant to subclause (iii) of this clause (b), 
the Issuer shall deliver to the Fiscal Agent (A) a certificate signed by the 
Authorised Signatories stating that the relevant requirement or circumstance
10272790607-v17 112 70-41061831
giving rise to the right to substitute or amend the terms of the Notes, as applicable, 
pursuant to this clause (b) is satisfied and the reasons therefor and such certificate 
will be conclusive and binding on the Holders, and (B) an opinion of independent 
legal advisers of recognised standing to the effect that circumstances entitling the 
Issuer to exercise its right to substitute or amend the terms of the Notes, as 
applicable, pursuant to this clause (b) have arisen; and
(v) no Trigger Event or Viability Event has occurred prior to the relevant Substitution 
or Amendment Effective Date.
In connection with any substitution or amendment in accordance with this clause (b), the 
Issuer shall comply with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Notes are for the 
time being listed or admitted to trading.

consent of the Holders, make any amendment to these Terms and Conditions that it 
considers to be (i) necessary or desirable to give effect to (A) the provisions of clause (a) 
of Condition 16 (Issuer Substitution) (including, without limitation, (x) if the Substitute 
Issuer is organised and/or resident for tax purposes in a jurisdiction other than Switzerland, 
any amendments to any references to the jurisdiction of "Switzerland" contained herein, 
including, without limitation, amendments to the definition of the term "Bankruptcy 
Event", the definition of the term "Business Day", the governing law of the subordination 
provisions set forth in Condition 4 (Status and Subordination) and the provisions of 
Condition 13 (Events of Default), and (y) any amendments to reflect UBS Group AG's 
guarantee described in subclause (a)(iii) of Condition 16 (Issuer Substitution)), or (B) the 
provisions of subclause (e)(iii) and/or subclause (e)(i)(B) of Condition 9 (Conversion), or
(ii) formal, minor or technical in nature, or (iii) necessary to correct a manifest error, or
(iv) not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Holders.

10272790607-v17 113 70-41061831
16. ISSUER SUBSTITUTION
(a) The Issuer (for purposes of this Condition 16, the "Current Issuer") may, without the 
consent of the Holders, substitute any entity (whether or not such entity is organised under 
the laws of Switzerland) (such substitute entity, the "Substitute Issuer") for itself as 
principal debtor under the Notes upon giving no more than 30 and no less than 10 days' 
notice to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices), provided that:
(i) the Substitute Issuer is UBS Group AG or, if the Substitute Issuer is not UBS 
Group AG, (A) an exemption exists from the requirement to register the 
Substitute Issuer as an investment company under the US Investment Company 
Act, and (B) at least 95 per cent. of the Substitute Issuer's capital and voting rights 
are held, directly or indirectly, by UBS Group AG;
(ii) the Current Issuer is not in default in respect of any amount payable under the 
Notes at the time of such substitution;
(iii) if the Substitute Issuer is not UBS Group AG, UBS Group AG has irrevocably 
and unconditionally guaranteed to the Holders, pursuant to article 111 of the 
Swiss Code and on a subordinated basis corresponding mutatis mutandis to 
Condition 4 (Status and Subordination), (A) the due and punctual payment of 
principal and interest and all other amounts due and payable by the Substitute 
Issuer under, or in respect of, the Notes upon receipt of the written request for 
payment of the relevant amount, and (B) upon the occurrence of a Conversion, 
the due delivery of the Ordinary Shares required to be delivered pursuant to 
Condition 9 (Conversion), and on the terms whereby subclause (iii) of 
Condition 5(h) (Cancellation of interest; prohibited interest), subclause (d)(ii)(C) 
of Condition 9 (Conversion), Condition 11 (Taxation), Condition 13 (Events of 
Default) and Condition 21 (No Set-off by Holders) apply to UBS Group AG and 
to its obligations under such guarantee either by making the necessary 
consequential amendments to such Conditions or including such Conditions 
applicable to UBS Group AG and to its obligations under such guarantee in such 
guarantee itself, as applicable;
(iv) the Current Issuer and the Substitute Issuer (A) have entered into such documents 
(the "Substitution Documents") as are necessary to give effect to such 
substitution and pursuant to which the Substitute Issuer has (x) undertaken in 
favour of each Holder to be bound by these Terms and Conditions as the principal 
debtor (on a subordinated basis corresponding to Condition 4 (Status and 
Subordination)) under the Notes in place of the Current Issuer and (y) assumed 
the obligations of the Current Issuer under the Fiscal Agency Agreement, and
(B) procure that all action, conditions and things required to be taken, fulfilled 
and done (including, without limitation, the obtaining of any necessary consents) 
to ensure that the Substitution Documents represent valid, legally binding and 
enforceable obligations of the Substitute Issuer have been taken, fulfilled and 
done and are in full force and effect;
(v) if the Substitute Issuer is resident for tax purposes in a jurisdiction (the "New 
Residence") other than that in which the Current Issuer prior to such substitution 
was resident for tax purposes (the "Former Residence"), the Substitution 
Documents contain an undertaking by the Substitute Issuer and/or such other 
provisions as may be necessary to ensure that each Holder has the benefit of an 
undertaking in terms corresponding to the provisions of Condition 11 (Taxation) 
in relation to the payment of all amounts due and payable under, or in respect of, 
the Notes and in relation to the guarantee referred to in subclause (iii) above, with, 
in the case of the Notes but not such guarantee, the substitution of references to 
the Former Residence with references to the New Residence, and an undertaking 
by the Substitute Issuer to indemnify each Holder against any Tax that is imposed 
on it by (or by any authority in or of) the New Residence and, if different, the 
jurisdiction of the Substitute Issuer's organisation with respect to any Note and
10272790607-v17 114 70-41061831
that would not have been so imposed had the substitution not been made, as well 
as against any Tax, and any cost or expense, relating to such substitution;
(vi) if the Substitute Issuer is not UBS Group AG, FINMA has approved such 
substitution (if such approval is then required under applicable Swiss laws and 
regulations), and the Current Issuer and the Substitute Issuer have obtained all 
other necessary governmental and other approvals and consents for such 
substitution and for the performance by the Substitute Issuer of its obligations 
under the Substitution Documents;
(vii) if the Substitute Issuer is not organised under the laws of Switzerland, the 
Substitute Issuer has appointed a process agent as its agent in Switzerland to 
receive service of process on its behalf in relation to any legal proceedings arising 
out of or in connection with the Notes; and
(viii) such substitution does not give rise to a Tax Event or a Regulatory Event.
(b) Upon any substitution pursuant to clause (a) of this Condition 16, (i) the Substitute Issuer 
will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the 
Current Issuer under the Notes with the same effect as if the Substitute Issuer had been 
named as Issuer in these Terms and Conditions, and (ii) the Current Issuer will be released 
from its obligations under the Notes.
(c) After giving effect to any substitution pursuant to clause (a) of this Condition 16,
(i) references to the "Issuer" in the Notes and these Terms and Conditions will be 
references to the Substitute Issuer, and (ii) references to the "Tax Jurisdiction" in the Notes 
and these Terms and Conditions will be read and construed as including the jurisdiction of 
establishment of the Substitute Issuer and, if different, the jurisdiction in which the 
Substitute Issuer is resident for tax purposes instead of or in addition to (as the case may 
be) references to the jurisdiction of establishment of the Issuer and Switzerland.
17. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER OR SALE
The Issuer will not consolidate with, merge with or into, or sell, convey, transfer or otherwise 
dispose of all or substantially all of its property and assets (as an entirety or substantially as an 
entirety in one transaction or a series of related transactions) to, any Person (other than with, into or 
to any Person of which at least 95 per cent. of such Person's capital and voting rights are held, 
directly or indirectly, by the Issuer) or permit any Person to merge with or into the Issuer unless 
(a) the Issuer will be the continuing Person, or (b) the Person formed by such consolidation or into 
which the Issuer is merged or that acquired such property and assets of the Issuer expressly assumes 
in writing (or, in the case of an acquisition of property and assets, guarantees) all of the obligations 
of the Issuer under the Notes.
18. FURTHER ISSUES
The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Holders issue further notes and, 
provided that such notes have the same terms and conditions as the Notes in all respects (or in all 
respects except for the issue date and/or first date on which interest is paid), such further notes will 
be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes. If the Issuer issues any such further notes 
pursuant to this Condition 18, references in these Terms and Conditions to "Notes" include such 
further notes, unless the context otherwise requires.
19. CURRENCY INDEMNITY
Any amount received or recovered by any Holder in a currency other than USD (whether as a result 
of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the insolvency, 
winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise) under the Notes will only constitute a 
discharge of the Issuer to the extent of the amount in USD that such Holder is able to purchase 
with the amount so received or recovered in such other currency on the date of such receipt or 
recovery (or, if it is not practicable to purchase USD with such amount on such date, on the first 
date on which it is practicable to do so). If the amount of USD that such Holder is able to purchase 
is less than the amount owed by the Issuer to such Holder under the Notes, the Issuer shall
10272790607-v17 115 70-41061831
indemnify such Holder against any loss sustained by it as a result. In addition, the Issuer shall 
indemnify such Holder for the costs of making such purchase. For purposes of this Condition 19, 
it is sufficient for the relevant Holder to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an 
actual purchase been made. The indemnities under this Condition 19 will (a) constitute a separate 
and independent obligation from the Issuer's other obligations hereunder, (b) give rise to a separate 
and independent cause of action, (c) apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any Holder 
and (d) continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a 
liquidated amount in respect of any amount due under the Notes or any other judgment or order.
20. RULE 144A INFORMATION
If at any time the Issuer is neither a reporting company under Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the 
US Exchange Act, nor exempt from reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the US Exchange 
Act, the Issuer will comply with any applicable requirements of Rule 144A(d)(4) under the US 
Securities Act in relation to the Notes.
21. NO SET-OFF BY HOLDERS
Subject to applicable law, each Holder and Indirect Holder, by acceptance of any direct or 
beneficial interest in a Note, agrees that it will not, and waives its right to, exercise, claim or plead 
any right of set-off, compensation or retention with respect to any amount owed to it by the Issuer 
in respect of, or arising in connection with, the Notes.
22. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
(a) The Notes and all non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the 
Notes are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Switzerland.
(b) The courts of the Canton of Zurich (venue being the City of Zurich) shall have exclusive 
jurisdiction to settle any disputes that may arise out of or in connection with the Notes, 
including any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with the Notes.

Deferred Contingent Capital Plan 2023/24 (DCCP) 
Summary description of the terms and conditions of DCCP as a capital instrument
Overview Issues under the DCCP are made by UBS Group AG or certain other employing 
entities to key contributors at UBS Group AG or any of its subsidiaries (together, 
the "Group"). Eligibility is determined by the Issuer and issues are granted at its 
sole discretion.
Issuer UBS Group AG or certain other employing entities of the UBS group
Type of 
instrument
Non-transferable contingent right against the Issuer to receive
(i) discretionary annual interest equivalent payments on the nominal 
value of a hypothetical perpetual Additional Tier 1 ("AT1") security 
notionally issued by UBS Group AG at grant (the "Notional Bond"), 
and
(i) at redemption, as determined by the Issuer in its sole discretion, 
either the value of the Notional Bond in cash or perpetual AT1 
securities issued or guaranteed by UBS Group AG or any other 
member of the Group of equivalent value (in each case net of any 
applicable taxes and social security contributions to the employee's 
account).
For DCCP awarded to EU/UK Material Risk Takers (MRT)1
 and individuals 
performing designated UK Senior Management Functions (SMF)2
 there will be no 
contingent right to receive discretionary annual interest payments; only a nontransferable contingent right against the Issuer to receive the amount indicated 
under (ii) above.
Conditional 
Interest 
Equivalents
Subject to (i) the conditions set out under "Trigger Event or Viability Event" and 
"Forfeiture and Vesting Provisions" and (ii) the discretionary and mandatory 
interest cancellation provisions as set out below, interest equivalents will be 
payable annually in arrears on the nominal value of the Notional Bond at a rate of 
4.60% for CHF-denominated issues and 8.30% for USD-denominated issues. 
The Issuer may, at its discretion, elect to cancel any interest equivalent that is 
otherwise scheduled to be paid on any interest payment date. In addition, without 
limitation to the foregoing, payments of interest equivalents will not be made 
unless sufficient distributable items (i.e., net profits carried forward and freely 
distributable reserves) of UBS Group AG are available.
Maturity date Issues under the DCCP have no scheduled maturity date. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to the conditions set out under "Trigger 
Event or Viability Event" and "Forfeiture and Vesting Provisions", issues to US 
taxpayers will mature and be settled on or about 1 March 2029 (the "First Call 
Date"), or for US-based SMFs on 1 March 2030 and 1 March 2031 as mentioned 
below. The Notional Bond underlying such issues will have no scheduled maturity 
date.
1 Based on relevant European Banking Authority's ("EBA") Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) for EU MRTs, 
and for UK MRTs, based on the EBA RTS and the UK Prudential Regulation Authority's and Financial Conduct 
Authority's rules.
2 As defined by the UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority.
Trigger Event 
or Viability 
Event
All outstanding issuances under the DCCP (or, in case of a Trigger Event (as 
defined below), all outstanding awards under the DCCP in relation to which a 
Trigger Event has occurred) will be automatically and permanently written down 
to zero, no further amounts will be due or paid thereunder and such awards will 
be permanently cancelled, if:
a) the reported Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of the Group set forth in UBS 
Group AG 's quarterly financial accounts, results, the annual report, or in 
any reviewed interim measurement published upon the instruction of the 
Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA ("FINMA"), falls 
below 7% or, with respect to grants awarded to Group Executive Board 
members, 10%, as of the relevant balance sheet date (each, a "Trigger 
Event");
b) FINMA provides UBS Group AG with written notice of its determination 
that amounts outstanding under the DCCP are required to be written 
down to prevent the insolvency, bankruptcy or failure of UBS Group AG; 
or
c) UBS Group AG has received a commitment of direct or indirect 
extraordinary support from the public sector that FINMA has determined 
and confirmed in writing to UBS Group AG is necessary to prevent the 
insolvency, bankruptcy or failure of UBS Group AG (an event described 
in clause (b) or (c), a "Viability Event").
Conditional 
Redemption
Subject to the conditions set out under "Trigger Event or Viability Event" and 
"Forfeiture and Vesting Provisions" and except as mentioned below, the Issuer 
may, at its sole discretion, redeem any issuance by way of either a cash payment 
or delivery of AT1 securities on the First Call Date, provided that, where the 
Issuer has elected to redeem an issuance by way of a cash payment, a 
redemption will not occur until FINMA has approved it.
DCCP issuances to SMFs may be redeemed by the Issuer on the same basis, in 
equal quantities on 1 March 2030 and 1 March 2031. However, the following 
exceptions will apply:
a) For SMFs who are members of the Group Executive Board, the DCCP 
Issuances may be redeemed on the same basis with 13% redeemed on 1 
March 2030 and 87% redeemed on 1 March 2031;
b) For certain designated below-GEB SMFs, the DCCP Issuances may be 
redeemed on the same basis with 20% redeemed on 1 March 2030 and 
80% redeemed on 1 March 2031.
In case of a redemption by way of delivery of securities, the securities will be 
perpetual AT1 securities issued or guaranteed by UBS or any other member of 
the Group with substantially the same terms and provisions consistent with the 
Notional Bond, including but not limited to, the same Trigger and Viability Events. 
Furthermore, the aggregate value of the AT1 securities shall, subject to rounding, 
equal the value of the Notional Bond (net of any applicable taxes and social 
security contributions).
For issuances granted to US taxpayers, redemption will be on the First Call Date, 
or for US-based SMFs on 1 March 2030 and 1 March 2031 as mentioned above, 
such that if FINMA approval for any cash settlement has not been given at the 
applicable point in time, issuances must be settled by delivery of AT1 securities, 
on or about that date. Any AT1 securities delivered at settlement shall be 
marketable subordinated UBS Group AG debt instruments in the AT1 category 
having such terms and provisions consistent with the Notional Bond terms and 
provisions as determined by UBS Group AG in its sole discretion on or prior to the 
Grant Date.
Forfeiture and 
Vesting 
Provisions
Subject to the conditions set out under "Trigger Event or Viability Event", 
issuances under the DCCP will vest after a minimum of five years.
An outstanding unvested issuance under the DCCP will generally be forfeited and 
cancelled, and no further interest equivalents will generally be due or paid, due to 
termination of employment or harmful acts by the employee. In certain 
circumstances, vesting of outstanding awards under the DCCP may be subject to 
conditions relating to the performance of the Group and/or the employee's 
business division and similar conditions. In addition, with respect to any award 
granted to Group Executive Board members, if the Group does not generate an 
adjusted pre-tax profit with respect to any financial year ending during or after the 
year of grant, but prior to the relevant vesting date, the nominal amount of such 
award will be reduced by 20% (for each year the Group does not generate an 
adjusted pre-tax profit) of the nominal amount of such award on the relevant grant 
date.
In case of death (in or out of service) or disability, an outstanding unvested 
issuance under the DCCP will vest on the date that the employee's employment 
contract terminates due to death or disability or any other date as determined by 
the Issuer.
Vesting may be accelerated, and forfeiture provisions may be relaxed, in case of 
early termination of the DCCP by, or change of control in, UBS Group AG.
Status In the event of the liquidation or winding up of the Issuer under circumstances 
that do not coincide with the occurrence of a Trigger Event or a Viability Event, 
the holder will have a claim ranking junior to all rights and claims of priority 
creditors of the Issuer (i.e., claims in respect of obligations of the Issuer (i) that 
are unsubordinated or (ii) that are subordinated (including Tier 2 instruments) and 
do not, or are expressly not stated to, rank pari passu with, or junior to, the 
Issuer's obligations under the DCCP or any of the Issuer's obligations ranking pari 
passu with the Issuer's obligations under the DCCP).

multiples of USD 1,000 in excess thereof. The principal amount of the Notes may be 
written down in the circumstances and in the manner described in Condition 8 
(Contingent Write-down). The Notes may be held and transferred only in minimum 
denominations of USD 200,000 and integral multiples of USD 1,000 in excess thereof.
(b) Global Certificates
(i) Notes that are initially sold in the United States to "qualified institutional 
buyers" (each, a "QIB") within the meaning of Rule 144A under the US 
Securities Act ("Rule 144A") are initially represented by one or more permanent 
registered global certificates (each, a "Rule 144A Global Certificate"), without 
interest coupons, deposited with the Fiscal Agent as custodian for, and 
registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee for, DTC. Notes that are 
initially sold in an "offshore transaction" within the meaning of Regulation S of 
the US Securities Act are initially represented by one or more permanent 
registered global certificates (each, a "Regulation S Global Certificate"), 
without interest coupons, deposited with the Fiscal Agent as custodian for, and 
registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee for, DTC, provided that upon 
such Regulation S Global Certificate's deposit, all beneficial interests in the 
Notes represented thereby are maintained at or through Euroclear and/or 
Clearstream, Luxembourg until expiration of the Distribution Compliance 
Period. The form of Regulation S Global Certificate and the form of Rule 144A 
Global Certificate are set out in the Fiscal Agency Agreement, which will be 
made available by the Registrar to any Holder or Indirect Holder upon written 
request.
(ii) The aggregate principal amount of the Notes represented by each of the Global 
Certificates may from time to time be increased or decreased by adjustments 
made on the records of the Registrar. Each Global Certificate shall have affixed 
a schedule for the purpose of recording adjustments in the aggregate principal 
amount thereof; provided, however, that, in the event of a discrepancy between 
the principal amounts recorded on such schedule and the amounts listed on the 
records of the Registrar, the principal amounts listed on the records of the 
Registrar will control. Any beneficial interest of an Indirect Holder in any Note 
represented by one of the Global Certificates that is transferred to a Person who 
takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest in such Note represented by
10279448089-v20 82 70-41069139
another Global Certificate will, upon transfer, cease to be a beneficial interest in 
such first Global Certificate and become a beneficial interest in the other Global 
Certificate and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, 
if any, and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other 
Global Certificate for as long as it retains such an interest.
(iii) So long as the Notes are represented by one or more Global Certificates 
deposited with, or with a custodian for, the Depositary, the Holder of a Global 
Certificate may grant proxies and otherwise authorise any Person, including, 
without limitation, participants of a Relevant Clearing System and Persons that 
may hold interests through such participants, to take any action that the Holder 
is entitled to take under these Terms and Conditions or the Notes (including, 
without limitation, delivery of a Settlement Shares Settlement Notice following 
a Conversion Event in accordance with clause (j) of Condition 9 (Conversion)), 
and nothing in these Terms and Conditions will prevent the Issuer or the Agents 
or the Settlement Share Depository (if any) or any of their respective agents 
from giving effect to any such proxies or other authorisations furnished by the 
Holder of a Global Certificate for purposes of this subclause (b)(iii). Although 
the Holders are the only Persons entitled to participate in, and vote at, any 
meeting of Holders, so long as the Notes are represented by one or more Global 
Certificates deposited with, or with a custodian for, the Depositary, the Holder 
of a Global Certificate shall (A) obtain instructions from the relevant Indirect 
Holders in respect of any meeting of Holders, (B) vote at such meeting in 
respect of each Note represented by such Global Certificate in accordance with 
the instructions received from the relevant Indirect Holder and (C) abstain from 
representing any Note represented by such Global Certificate at a meeting of 
Holders for which it has not received an instruction from the relevant Indirect 
Holder. Only the Notes represented by such Global Certificate for which the 
Holder received an instruction by the relevant Indirect Holder to take part at a 
meeting of Holders will be deemed to be present or represented at such meeting.
(c) Definitive Certificates
(i) Definitive Notes in registered form (each, a "Definitive Certificate") shall be 
issued, and a Global Certificate will be exchanged, in whole, but not in part, for 
Definitive Certificates, if (and only if):
(A) the Depositary notifies the Issuer that it is no longer willing or able to 
discharge properly its responsibilities as depositary with respect to some 
or all of the Global Certificates, or ceases to be a "clearing agency" 
registered under the US Exchange Act; or
(B) at any time the Depositary is no longer eligible to act as such, or the 
Notes cease for any reason to be eligible for clearing through the 
Depositary, and the Issuer is unable to locate a qualified successor 
within 90 days of receiving notice of such ineligibility of the Depositary 
or of the Notes, as the case may be, from or on behalf of the Depositary; 
or
(C) issuance of the Definitive Certificates is required by Swiss or other 
applicable laws or regulations in connection with the enforcement of 
rights under the Notes; or
(D) the Issuer provides its consent.
(ii) If a Global Certificate is to be exchanged for Definitive Certificates pursuant to 
subclause (i) of this clause (c), the Issuer will procure the prompt delivery (free 
of charge) of Definitive Certificates to the Fiscal Agent, duly executed without 
interest coupons, registered in the names of the relevant Indirect Holders, 
addresses and denominations provided in a written notice to be given by the 
Depositary or the Issuer to the Fiscal Agent (which notice shall be given subject 
to the Depositary's procedures and also specify the taxpayer identification 
number,
10279448089-v20 83 70-41069139
if any, of each Person in whose name such Definitive Certificates are to be 
registered). Upon written direction of the Issuer, the Fiscal Agent will deliver 
such Definitive Certificates to the Holders thereof no later than five Business 
Days after receipt by the Fiscal Agent of the written notice provided by the 
Depositary (or the Issuer, as applicable) referred to above (and any other 
necessary information as the Fiscal Agent may reasonably request from the 
Issuer at such time). The Fiscal Agent shall promptly cancel and deliver to the 
Issuer the surrendered Global Certificates. The form of Definitive Certificate 
that will be issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in a Note represented by 
a Rule 144A Global Certificate and the form of Definitive Certificate that will 
be issued in exchange for a beneficial interest in a Note represented by a 
Regulation S Global Certificate are set out in the Fiscal Agency Agreement, 
which will be made available by the Registrar to any Holder or Indirect Holder 
upon written request.
(iii) If Definitive Certificates have been issued pursuant to this Condition 2(c), any 
Definitive Certificate that is lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed may be 
replaced, subject to applicable laws and regulations, at the Specified Office of the 
Fiscal Agent upon payment by the claimant of the fees, costs and expenses 
incurred by the Fiscal Agent and the Issuer in connection therewith and on such 
terms as to evidence, security and indemnity (which may provide, among other 
things, that if the Definitive Certificate allegedly or actually lost, stole or 
destroyed is subsequently presented for payment there shall be paid to the Issuer 
on demand the amount payable by the Issuer in respect of such Definitive 
Certificate subsequently presented) as the Issuer may require. Mutilated or 
defaced Definitive Certificates must be surrendered before replacements will be 
issued.
3. TRANSFER
(a) General
(i) Subject to Conditions 3(b) and 3(c), title to Notes will pass on transfer by 
assignment (Zession) and due registration in the Register. All transfers of Notes 
and entries on the Register will be made subject to the provisions concerning 
transfers of Notes set forth in the Fiscal Agency Agreement, which will be made 
available by the Registrar to any Holder or Indirect Holder upon written request.
(ii) Transfers of Notes, or of beneficial interests in Notes represented by Global 
Certificates, may be made only in accordance with the legend set forth upon the 
face of the applicable Global Certificate or Definitive Certificate, and the 
Registrar will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any Note or 
beneficial interests in Notes except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to 
the Fiscal Agent and the Registrar that such transfer is being made in compliance 
with such legend.
(iii) Transfers of Notes and the issue of new Global Certificates or Definitive 
Certificates, as the case may be, on transfer will be effected without charge by or 
on behalf of the Issuer or the Registrar, but upon payment of any tax or other 
governmental charges that may be imposed in relation to the transfer (or the 
giving of such indemnity as the Fiscal Agent or the Registrar may require) by the 
Holder.
(iv) No Holder may require the transfer of a Note to be registered (x) if the Notes are 
to be redeemed pursuant to Condition 6 (Redemption and Purchase), during the 
period of 15 days ending on (and including) the relevant Redemption Date, or
(y) during the period of 15 days ending on (and including) the Record Date for 
any Interest Payment Date.
(v) No Person (including any Indirect Holder) other than the Holder(s) will have 
any rights, or be owed any obligations by the Issuer, under the Notes. Payments 
of principal, interest or any other amount in respect of Notes will be made only 
to
10279448089-v20 84 70-41069139
the Person shown on the Register as the registered holder of such Note (i.e., the 
Holder) at close of business on the relevant Record Date.
(b) Transfer of Notes represented by a Global Certificate
(i) Global Certificates may be transferred only in whole, but not in part, and only to 
a Relevant Clearing System or any of their respective successors or nominees, in 
each case located outside of Switzerland, except as provided below. Beneficial 
interests of Indirect Holders in Notes represented by Global Certificates may be 
transferred only in accordance with the rules and procedures of such Relevant 
Clearing System, the provisions of the Fiscal Agency Agreement and this 
Condition 3(b).
(ii) A beneficial interest in a Note represented by a Regulation S Global Certificate 
may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial 
interest in a Note represented by a Rule 144A Global Certificate during the 
Distribution Compliance Period, only if such exchange occurs in connection with 
a transfer of beneficial interests in the Notes pursuant to Rule 144A and the 
transferor first delivers to the Fiscal Agent and the Registrar a written certificate 
substantially in the form of a certificate available on request from the Registrar to 
the effect that the beneficial interests in the Notes are being transferred to a Person 
who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A 
under the US Securities Act, purchasing the beneficial interests in the Notes for 
its own account or the account of a QIB in a transaction meeting the requirements 
of Rule 144A and in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states 
of the United States and other jurisdictions.
(iii) A beneficial interest in a Note represented by a Rule 144A Global Certificate may 
be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial interest 
in a Note represented by a Regulation S Global Certificate, whether before or after 
the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, only if the transferor first 
delivers to the Fiscal Agent and the Registrar a written certificate substantially in 
the form of a certificate available on request from the Registrar to the effect that 
the transfer is being conducted in compliance with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of 
Regulation S under the US Securities Act.
(iv) Until the termination of the Distribution Compliance Period, beneficial interests 
in any Regulation S Global Certificate may be held only through participants 
acting for and on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, provided 
that this subclause (iv) shall not prohibit any transfer in accordance with 
subclause (ii) of this Condition 3(b).
(c) Transfer of Notes represented by a Definitive Certificate
(i) If and when Definitive Certificates have been issued pursuant to Condition 2(c), 
one or more Notes may be transferred only in accordance with the legends set 
forth upon the face of the relevant Definitive Certificate and only upon the 
surrender (at the Specified Office of the Registrar) of the Definitive Certificate 
representing such Notes to be transferred, together with the form of transfer 
attached to such Definitive Certificate (or another form of transfer substantially 
in the same form and containing the same representations and certifications (if 
any), unless otherwise agreed by the Issuer), duly completed and executed and 
any other evidence as the Fiscal Agent and the Registrar may reasonably 
require. A new Definitive Certificate shall be issued to the transferee in respect 
of the Notes that are the subject of the relevant transfer and, in the case of a 
transfer of part only of a holding of Notes represented by one Definitive 
Certificate, a new Definitive Certificate in respect of the balance of the Notes 
not transferred shall be issued to the transferor. In the case of a transfer of Notes 
to a Person who is already a Holder, a new Definitive Certificate representing 
the enlarged holding may be issued but only against surrender of the Definitive 
Certificate representing the existing holding of such Person.
10279448089-v20 85 70-41069139
(ii) Each new Definitive Certificate to be issued pursuant to Condition 2(c) shall be 
available for delivery within three Relevant Banking Days of receipt of the form 
of transfer and surrender of the relevant Definitive Certificate. Delivery of new 
Definitive Certificate(s) will be made at the Specified Office of the Fiscal Agent 
to which delivery and surrender of such form of transfer and Definitive 
Certificate or, as the case may be, surrender of such Definitive 
Certificate, will have been made or, at the option of the relevant Holder 
and as specified in the relevant form of transfer or otherwise in writing, 
be mailed by uninsured post at the risk of the Holder entitled to the new 
Definitive Certificate to such address as may be so specified, unless such 
Holder requests otherwise and pays in advance to the Fiscal Agent the 
costs of such other method of delivery and/or such insurance as it may 
specify.
(d) Rule 144A
Each Note that is initially sold in the United States to a QIB will not be registered under 
the US Securities Act, or with any securities regulatory authority of any state or other 
jurisdiction of the United States and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred, 
except (i) in accordance with Rule 144A to a Person that the Holder and any Person acting 
on its behalf reasonably believe is a QIB that is acquiring the Notes for its own account or 
for the account of one or more QIBs, (ii) in an offshore transaction in accordance with 
Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S under the US Securities Act, (iii) pursuant to an 
exemption from registration under Rule 144 under the US Securities Act, or in accordance 
with another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, registration under the US 
Securities Act, if available, or (iv) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the 
US Securities Act, in each case, in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any 
state of the United States.
4. STATUS AND SUBORDINATION
(a) Status
The Notes constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer and rank 
pari passu and without any preference among themselves. The rights and claims of the 
Holders against the Issuer under the Notes are subordinated as described in clause (b) of 
this Condition 4.
(b) Subordination
In the event of (i) a Bankruptcy Event or (ii) an order being made, or an effective 
resolution being passed, for the liquidation or winding-up of the Issuer (except, in any such 
case, a solvent liquidation or winding-up of the Issuer solely for purposes of a 
reorganisation, reconstruction or amalgamation of the Issuer or the substitution in place of 
the Issuer of a successor in business to the Issuer, the terms of which reorganisation, 
reconstruction, amalgamation or substitution (x) have previously been approved by a valid 
resolution of the Holders and (y) do not provide that the Notes shall become redeemable in 
accordance with these Terms and Conditions),
(i) if such event occurs (x) prior to the occurrence of a Conversion Capital 
Availability Event, or (y) on or after the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event but prior to the occurrence of a Conversion 
Event, the rights and claims of the Holders against the Issuer in respect 
of or arising under (including, without limitation, any damages awarded 
for breach of any obligation under) the Notes will, subject to any 
obligations that are mandatorily preferred by law, rank (A) junior to the 
rights and claims of all holders of Senior Obligations,
(B) pari passu with the rights and claims of holders of Parity 
Obligations, and
(C) senior to the rights and claims of holders of Junior Obligations; 
provided, however, that, if a Conversion Event subsequently occurs while 
such Bankruptcy Event or liquidation or winding-up, as the case may be, 
is continuing, the rights and claims of the Holders against the Issuer in 
respect of the delivery of Ordinary
10279448089-v20 86 70-41069139
Shares in accordance with Condition 9 (Conversion) will rank as set 
forth in subclause (ii) below; or
(ii) if such event occurs on or after the occurrence of a Conversion Event, 
the rights and claims of the Holders against the Issuer in respect of the 
delivery of Ordinary Shares in accordance with Condition 9 
(Conversion) will rank (A) junior to the rights and claims of all holders 
of Senior Obligations, (B) junior to the rights and claims of holders of 
Parity Obligations, and (C) pari passu with the rights and claims of 
holders of Junior Obligations.
(c) Claims subject to a Contingent Write-down or a Conversion
Any claim of any Holder in respect of or arising under the Notes (including, without 
limitation, any claim in relation to any unsatisfied payment obligation of the Issuer 
subject to enforcement by any Holder pursuant to Condition 13 (Events of Default) or in 
relation to the occurrence of any other Event of Default) will be subject to, and 
superseded by, Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), as 
applicable, irrespective of whether the relevant Trigger Event or Viability Event, as 
applicable, has occurred, or, in the case of a Viability Event, the relevant Viability Event 
Notice has been given, prior to or after the occurrence of an Event of Default or any 
other event.
5. INTEREST
(a) Interest Payment Dates
(i) Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) 
and clause (h) of this Condition 5, the Notes will bear interest on their principal 
amount (A) from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the First Call 
Date, at the Fixed Interest Rate, and (B) thereafter, at the applicable Reset 
Interest Rate.
(ii) Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) 
and clause (i) of this Condition 5, interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually in arrear on 12 April and 12 October of each year (each, an "Interest 
Payment Date"), commencing on 12 April 2024.
(b) Determination of the Mid Market Swap Rate, the Reset Interest Rate and the Reset 
Interest Amount in relation to each Reset Interest Period
With respect to each Reset Interest Period and subject to clause (c) of this Condition 5, 
the Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after the Relevant Time on the Reset 
Determination Date in relation to such Reset Interest Period, determine the Mid Market 
Swap Rate and the Reset Interest Rate for such Reset Interest Period and calculate the 
amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount on the Interest Payment Date in 
relation to each Interest Period falling in such Reset Interest Period (each, a "Reset 
Interest Amount").
(c) Benchmark replacement
If the Issuer (in consultation with the Calculation Agent) determines prior to any Reset 
Determination Date that (x) the rate referred to in clause (a) of the definition of the term 
"Mid Market Swap Rate" (the "Existing Benchmark Rate") has been discontinued or
(y) there has been a public statement or publication of information by the administrator of 
the Existing Benchmark Rate or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of the 
Existing Benchmark Rate announcing that the Existing Benchmark Rate is no longer 
representative, then the following provisions shall apply (subject to the subsequent 
operation of this clause (c)):
(i) the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint an Independent Adviser to 
determine in the Independent Adviser's discretion, in accordance with 
subclause (iv) below, an alternative rate to the Existing Benchmark Rate (the 
"Alternative Benchmark Rate") no later than three Business Days prior to the
10279448089-v20 87 70-41069139
Reset Determination Date relating to the next succeeding Reset Interest Period 
(such Business Day, the "Independent Adviser Determination Cut-off Date", 
and such next succeeding Reset Interest Period, the "Affected Reset Interest 
Period") for purposes of determining the Mid Market Swap Rate in respect of the 
Affected Reset Interest Period and all Reset Interest Periods thereafter;
(ii) if prior to the Independent Adviser Determination Cut-off Date the Issuer is 
unable to appoint an Independent Adviser or the Independent Adviser appointed 
by the Issuer fails to determine an Alternative Benchmark Rate in accordance 
with subclause (iv) below, then the Issuer (in consultation with the Calculation 
Agent) may determine in its discretion, in accordance with subclause (iv) below, 
the Alternative Benchmark Rate for purposes of determining the Mid Market 
Swap Rate in respect of the Affected Reset Interest Period and all Reset Interest 
Periods thereafter;
(iii) if subclause (ii) above applies and the Issuer is unable or unwilling to determine 
the Alternative Benchmark Rate prior to the Reset Determination Date relating to 
the Affected Reset Interest Period in accordance with subclause (iv) below, the 
Mid Market Swap Rate in respect of the Affected Reset Interest Period will be 
equal to the Mid Market Swap Rate in respect of the immediately preceding Reset 
Interest Period (or, if there is no preceding Reset Interest Period, the Reset Interest 
Rate applicable to the Affected Reset Interest Period will be equal to the Fixed 
Interest Rate); provided, however, that, if this subclause (iii) applies to the 
Affected Reset Interest Period, the Reset Interest Rate for all succeeding Reset 
Interest Periods will be the Reset Interest Rate applicable to the Affected Reset 
Interest Period as determined in accordance with this subclause (iii) unless (A) the 
Issuer, in its sole discretion, elects to determine an Alternative Benchmark Rate 
in respect of any such succeeding Reset Interest Period and all Reset Interest 
Periods thereafter in accordance with the processes set out in this clause (c), and
(B) an Alternative Benchmark Rate is so determined;
(iv) in the case of any determination of an Alternative Benchmark Rate pursuant to 
subclause (i) or (ii) above, such Alternative Benchmark Rate will be such rate as 
the Independent Adviser or the Issuer (in consultation with the Calculation 
Agent), as applicable, determines in its reasonable discretion has replaced the 
Existing Benchmark Rate in customary market usage, or, if the Independent 
Adviser or the Issuer, as applicable, determines in its reasonable discretion that 
there is no such rate, such other rate as the Independent Adviser or the Issuer (in 
consultation with the Calculation Agent) determines in its reasonable discretion 
is most comparable to the Existing Benchmark Rate; and
(v) if the Independent Adviser or the Issuer determines an Alternative Benchmark 
Rate in accordance with the above provisions of this clause (c),
(A) the Independent Adviser (in the case of subclause (2) below, in 
consultation with the Issuer) or, following consultation with the 
Calculation Agent, the Issuer (as the case may be) shall also determine 
in its reasonable discretion (1) the method for obtaining such Alternative 
Benchmark Rate, including the page on or source from which such 
Alternative Benchmark Rate appears or is obtained (the "Alternative 
MMSR Page"), and the time at which such Alternative Benchmark Rate 
appears on, or is obtained from, the Alternative MMSR Page (the 
"Alternative Relevant Time"), (2) whether to apply an Adjustment 
Spread to such Alternative Benchmark Rate and, if so, the Adjustment 
Spread, which Adjustment Spread must be recognised or acknowledged 
as being in customary market usage in international debt capital markets 
transactions that reference the Existing Benchmark Rate, where such rate 
has been replaced by such Alternative Benchmark Rate, and (3) any 
alternative method for determining the Mid Market Swap Rate if such 
Alternative Benchmark Rate is unavailable on the relevant Reset
10279448089-v20 88 70-41069139
Determination Date, which alternative method shall be consistent with 
any Alternative Benchmark Rate that has broad market support;
(B) for the Affected Reset Interest Period and all Reset Interest Periods 
thereafter, (1) clause (a) of the definition of the term "Mid Market Swap 
Rate" shall be amended pursuant to clause (c) of Condition 14 (Meetings 
of Holders; Substitution and Amendment) to give effect to the 
determination described in subclause (A)(1) above and any Adjustment 
Spread determined pursuant to subclause (A)(2) above, and
(2) clause (b) of the definition of the term "Mid Market Swap 
Rate" shall be amended pursuant to clause (c) of Condition 14 
(Meetings of Holders; Substitution and Amendment) to give 
effect to the determination described in subclause (A)(3) above;
(C) references to the MMSR Page and the Relevant Time in these Terms and 
Conditions will be deemed to be references to the Alternative MMSR 
Page and the Alternative Relevant Time, respectively;
(D) if any changes to the definitions of the terms "Business Day", "Day 
Count Fraction", "Payment Business Day" and/or "Reset Determination 
Date" are necessary in order to implement the amendments described in 
subclause (B) above, such definitions shall be amended pursuant to 
clause (c) of Condition 14 (Meetings of Holders; Substitution and 
Amendment) to reflect such changes; and
(E) the Issuer shall promptly give notice to the Holders in accordance with 
Condition 15 (Notices) specifying such Alternative Benchmark Rate 
(including any Adjustment Spread determined pursuant to 
subclause (A)(2) above and any alternative method for determining the 
Mid Market Swap Rate described in subclause (A)(3) above), the 
Alternative MMSR Page, the Alternative Relevant Time, and any 
amendments implemented pursuant to clause (c) of Condition 14 
(Meetings of Holders; Substitution and Amendment) as described in 
subclauses (B) and (D) above.
Any determination that is made by an Independent Adviser or by the Issuer for purposes of 
this clause (c) will be made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
(d) Publication of Reset Interest Rate and interest amount payable upon redemption
With respect to each Reset Interest Period, as soon as practicable after such determination 
but in any event no later than the relevant Reset Date, the Calculation Agent will cause
(i) the relevant Reset Interest Rate and the relevant Reset Interest Amount determined by 
it, together with the Interest Payment Date in relation to each Interest Period falling in 
such Reset Interest Period, to be notified to the Issuer and the Paying Agents and (ii) the 
relevant Reset Interest Rate determined by it to be notified to any stock exchange or other 
relevant authority on which the Notes are at the relevant time listed and to be published in 
accordance with Condition 15 (Notices).
The Calculation Agent shall calculate any interest amount payable on any Redemption 
Date (if the Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to Condition 6 (Redemption and 
Purchase)) and cause such interest amount to be notified to Issuer and the Paying Agents 
and to any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the Notes are at the 
relevant time listed and to be published in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) no 
later than two Business Days prior to such Redemption Date.
(e) Calculation of amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount
Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) and clause 
(i) of this Condition 5:
10279448089-v20 89 70-41069139
(i) the amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount on each Interest 
Payment Date to (and including) the First Call Date in respect of the Notes will 
be (A) in the case of the first Interest Payment Date, USD 12.917, and (B) 
otherwise, USD 38.75; and
(ii) if interest is required to be paid in respect of a Note on any other date (including, 
for the avoidance of doubt, the Reset Interest Amount), the amount of interest 
payable per Calculation Amount on such date will be calculated by:
(A) applying the applicable Interest Rate to the Calculation Amount;
(B) multiplying the product thereof by the Day Count Fraction; and
(C) rounding the resulting figure to the nearest cent (half a cent being 
rounded upwards).
(f) Calculation of amount of interest payable per Note
Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) and 
clause (i) of this Condition 5, the amount of interest payable in respect of a Note will be 
the product of:
(i) the amount of interest per Calculation Amount; and
(ii) the number by which the Calculation Amount is required to be multiplied to equal 
the denomination of such Note.
(g) Notifications, etc. to be final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and 
decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for purposes of this Condition 5, whether 
by the Reset Reference Banks (or any of them) or the Calculation Agent or the 
Independent Adviser, will (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith and manifest error) 
be binding on the Issuer, the Agents and the Holders and (in the absence of wilful default 
and bad faith) no liability to the Issuer or the Holders will attach to the Reset Reference 
Banks (or any of them), the Calculation Agent or the Independent Adviser in connection 
with the exercise or non-exercise by the Calculation Agent or the Independent Adviser of 
its powers, duties and discretions under this Condition 5.
(h) Accrual of interest in the case of redemption or a Trigger Event or a Viability Event
(i) Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), 
if the Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to clause (b), (c) or (d) of Condition 6 
(Redemption and Purchase), interest on the Notes will accrue to (but excluding) 
the relevant Redemption Date, and will cease to accrue on such Redemption 
Date; provided, however, that if the payment with respect to any Note is 
improperly withheld or refused on such Redemption Date, interest will continue 
to accrue on the principal amount of such Note (both before and after judgment) 
at the relevant Interest Rate to the Relevant Date.
(ii) Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event or a Viability Event, interest on the 
Notes will cease to accrue from (and including) the date on which such Trigger 
Event or Viability Event occurs.
(i) Cancellation of interest; prohibited interest
(j) The Issuer may, in its sole discretion, elect to cancel all or part of any payment 
of interest on the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any related 
Additional Amounts) that is otherwise scheduled to be paid on an Interest 
Payment Date. This subclause (i)(i) is without prejudice to the provisions of 
subclause (i)(ii) of this Condition 5. Non-payment of any amount of interest by 
the Issuer to the Fiscal Agent will constitute evidence of cancellation of the
10279448089-v20 90 70-41069139
relevant payment, whether or not notice of cancellation has been given by the 
Issuer.
If practicable, the Issuer shall provide notice of any cancellation of interest (in 
whole or in part) pursuant to this subclause (i)(i) to the Holders on or prior to the 
relevant Interest Payment Date. If practicable, the Issuer shall endeavour to 
provide such notice at least five Business Days prior to the relevant Interest 
Payment Date. Failure to provide such notice will not have any impact on the 
effectiveness of, or otherwise invalidate, any such cancellation of interest, or give 
Holders any rights as a result of such failure.
(ii) The Issuer will be prohibited from making, in whole or in part, any payment of 
interest on the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any related 
Additional Amounts) on the relevant Interest Payment Date if and to the extent 
that:
(A) the amount of Distributable Items as at such Interest Payment Date is 
less than the sum of (1) the amount of such interest payment, plus (2) 
all other payments (other than redemption payments) made by UBS 
Group AG on or in respect of the Notes or any Parity Obligations or 
Junior Obligations since the balance sheet date of the Relevant 
Accounts and prior to such Interest Payment Date, plus (3) all payments 
(other than redemption payments) payable by UBS Group AG on such 
Interest Payment Date on or in respect of any Parity Obligations or 
Junior Obligations, in the case of each of subclauses (1), (2) and (3), 
excluding any portion of such payments already accounted for in 
determining the amount of such Distributable Items; and/or
(B) UBS Group AG is not, or will not immediately after the relevant 
payment of interest be, in compliance with all applicable minimum 
capital adequacy requirements of the National Regulations on a 
consolidated (Finanzgruppe) basis (for the avoidance of doubt, it being 
understood that such minimum requirements will reflect any reduction 
in such requirements granted by FINMA to the Group pursuant to the 
Capital Adequacy Ordinance); and/or
(C) FINMA has required the Issuer not to make such interest payment.
The Issuer shall deliver a certificate signed by the Authorised Signatories to the 
Fiscal Agent and shall give notice in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) to 
the Holders, in each case as soon as practicable following any determination that 
interest is required to be cancelled pursuant to this subclause (i)(ii) or, where no 
such prior determination is made, promptly following any Interest Payment Date 
on which interest was scheduled to be paid if such interest is being cancelled in 
accordance with this subclause (i)(ii), to such effect setting out brief details as to 
the amount of interest being cancelled and the reason therefor. Failure to provide 
such certificate and notice will not have any impact on the effectiveness of, or 
otherwise invalidate, any such cancellation or give any Holder any rights as a 
result of such failure.
(iii) If, on any Interest Payment Date, any payment of interest scheduled to be made 
on such date is not made in full pursuant to subclause (i)(i) or subclause (i)(ii) of 
this Condition 5, UBS Group AG shall not, directly or indirectly,
(A) recommend to Shareholders that any dividend or other distribution in 
cash or in kind (other than in the form of Ordinary Shares) be paid or 
made on any Ordinary Shares; or
(B) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any Ordinary Shares other than as 
a Permitted Transaction,
10279448089-v20 91 70-41069139
in each case unless and until (x) the interest payment due and payable on the 
Notes on any subsequent Interest Payment Date has been paid in full (or an 
amount equal to the same has been paid in full to a designated third party trust 
account for the benefit of the Holders prior to payment by the trustee thereof to 
the Holders on such subsequent Interest Payment Date) or, if earlier, (y) all 
outstanding Notes have been cancelled in accordance with these Terms and 
Conditions.
(iv) Payments of interest on the Notes are not cumulative. Notwithstanding any other 
provision in these Terms and Conditions, the cancellation or non-payment of 
any interest amount by virtue of this Condition 5(i) will not constitute a default 
for any purpose (including, without limitation, Condition 13 (Events of Default)) 
on the part of the Issuer. Any interest payment not paid by virtue of this 
Condition 5(i) will not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter, and 
Holders will have no right thereto.
(v) If UBS Group AG determines, after consultation with FINMA, that the Notes do 
not, or will cease to, fully qualify as Additional Tier 1 Capital, (A) the Issuer 
shall not, to the extent permitted under National Regulations, exercise its 
discretion pursuant to subclause (i)(i) of this Condition 5 to cancel any interest 
payments due on the Notes on any Interest Payment Date following the 
occurrence of such determination, and (B) the Issuer shall give notice to the 
Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) as soon as practicable after 
such determination stating that the Issuer may no longer exercise its discretion 
pursuant to subclause (i)(i) of this Condition 5 to cancel any interest payments 
as from the date of such notice.
6. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE
(a) No fixed redemption date
The Notes are perpetual securities in respect of which there is no fixed redemption date. 
Unless previously redeemed (including by way of Conversion pursuant to Condition 9 
(Conversion)) or purchased and cancelled in accordance with this Condition 6 and 
subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), the Notes 
are perpetual and may only be redeemed or purchased in accordance with this Condition 
6.
(b) Redemption at the option of the Issuer
Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 6, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to 
redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, on the First Call Date or any Interest 
Payment Date thereafter at their aggregate principal amount, together with any accrued 
and unpaid interest thereon to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date.
(c) Redemption due to a Tax Event
(i) Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 6, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event at 
any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to 
redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, on the relevant Redemption Date at 
their aggregate principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest 
thereon to (but excluding) such Redemption Date.
(ii) A "Tax Event" will have occurred if the Issuer in making any payments on the 
Notes (A) has paid, or will or would on the next payment date be required to 
pay, Additional Amounts, or (B) has paid, or will or would be required to pay, 
any additional Tax in respect of the Notes, in the case of each of subclauses (A) 
and (B), under the laws or regulations of a Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof or any authority of or in a Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof having the power to impose, levy, collect, withhold or assess 
Taxes, including, without limitation, any treaty to which a Tax Jurisdiction is a 
party, or any generally published application or interpretation of such laws 
(including, without limitation, a decision of any court or tribunal, any generally 
published
10279448089-v20 92 70-41069139
application or interpretation of such laws by any relevant tax authority or any 
generally published pronouncement by any relevant tax authority), and the Issuer 
cannot avoid the foregoing by taking measures reasonably available to it.
(d) Redemption due to a Regulatory Event
(i) Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 6, upon the occurrence of a Regulatory 
Event at any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, 
to redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, on the relevant Redemption Date at 
their aggregate principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest 
thereon to (but excluding) such Redemption Date.
(ii) A "Regulatory Event" will have occurred if any of the Notes ceases to be eligible 
in full to be (A) treated as Additional Tier 1 Capital, and/or (B) counted towards 
either the Going-Concern LR Requirement or the Going-Concern RWA 
Requirement (or both).
(e) Conditions for redemption
(i) If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes pursuant to clause (b), (c) or (d) of this 
Condition 6, then the Issuer shall give the Holders not less than 15 and not more 
than 60 days' prior notice in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) (a 
"Redemption Notice"), which notice shall, subject to subclauses (ii) and (iii) of 
this clause (e), be irrevocable and specify (x) the clause of this Condition 6 
pursuant to which the redemption is to be made, (y) if any Definitive Certificates 
have been issued, the method by which Notes to be redeemed will be tendered, 
and (z) the date (which date, in the case of a redemption pursuant to clause (c) or
(d) of this Condition 6, shall be a Payment Business Day) on which the Issuer 
will redeem the Notes pursuant to such clause of this Condition 6 (such specified 
date, the "Redemption Date").
(ii) The Issuer may only redeem the Notes pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of this 
Condition 6 on the relevant Redemption Date if FINMA has approved such 
redemption on or prior to such Redemption Date, if such approval is then required 
under applicable Swiss laws and regulations.
(iii) The Issuer may only redeem the Notes pursuant to any clause of this Condition 6 
on the relevant Redemption Date if no Trigger Event or Viability Event has 
occurred prior to such Redemption Date.
(iv) If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes pursuant to clause (c) or (d) of this 
Condition 6, then prior to the publication of the Redemption Notice pursuant to 
subclause (e)(i) of this Condition 6, the Issuer shall deliver to the Fiscal Agent 
(A) a certificate signed by the Authorised Signatories stating that the relevant 
requirement or circumstance giving rise to the right to redeem under clause (c) or 
(d), as applicable, of this Condition 6 is satisfied and the reasons therefor and such 
certificate will be conclusive and binding on the Holders, and (B) in the case of a 
redemption pursuant to clause (c) of this Condition 6 only, an opinion of 
independent legal advisers of recognised standing to the effect that circumstances 
entitling the Issuer to exercise its right of redemption under clause (c) of this 
Condition 6 have arisen.
(f) Purchases
The Issuer or any other member of the Group or any of their respective affiliates may at 
any time purchase Notes at any price in the open market or otherwise, provided that
(i) such purchase complies with any limits or conditions to which any member of the 
Group is subject under applicable banking laws and regulations at the time of such 
purchase, (ii) other than in the case of purchases made in connection with stabilisation 
measures in compliance with applicable law or in connection with any market making in 
the Notes, FINMA has approved such purchase (if such approval is then required under
10279448089-v20 93 70-41069139
applicable Swiss laws and regulations) on or prior to the date of such purchase, and (iii) no 
Trigger Event or Viability Event has occurred prior to the date of such purchase. Any 
Notes so purchased may, at the option of the Issuer, be held, reissued, resold or cancelled.
(g) Cancellation
All Notes redeemed in accordance with this Condition 6 or by way of Conversion 
pursuant to Condition 9 (Conversion) will be cancelled and may not be reissued or 
resold; provided, however, that, in the case of Notes redeemed by way of Conversion, 
the Issuer will not take any action to cause such Notes to be removed from the Relevant 
Clearing System prior to the later of (i) the applicable Settlement Date and (ii) the Final 
Cancellation Date. Following the issuance and delivery of the relevant Ordinary Shares 
to the Settlement Share Depository on the Conversion Date and until the later of (i) the 
applicable Settlement Date and (ii) the Final Cancellation Date, the Notes will evidence 
solely the Holder's right to receive Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds, as the case 
may be, from the Settlement Share Depository or the Settlement Shares Offer Agent (or 
such other relevant recipient).
(h) Redemption of other instruments
For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that, if, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event 
or a Regulatory Event, the Issuer does not elect to redeem the Notes pursuant to this 
Condition 6, nothing in this Condition 6 or any other provision of these Terms and 
Conditions will prohibit the Issuer from redeeming (whether early, at maturity or 
otherwise) any other instruments issued by any member of the Group pursuant to the 
terms thereof.
7. TRIGGER EVENT AND VIABILITY EVENT
(a) Trigger Event
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event:
(A) if such Trigger Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Contingent Write-down will occur on the 
applicable Trigger Event Write-down Date in accordance with Condition 
8 (Contingent Write-down); or
(B) if such Trigger Event occurs on or after the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Conversion will occur on the applicable 
Trigger Event Conversion Date in accordance with Condition 9 
(Conversion).
(ii) A "Trigger Event" will have occurred if the Issuer gives the Holders a Trigger 
Event Notice in accordance with clause (b) of this Condition 7.
(b) Trigger Event Notice
(i) If, with respect to any Publication Date, the Trigger CET1 Ratio as of such 
Publication Date is less than the Threshold Ratio, the Issuer shall, subject to 
subclauses (ii) and (iii) of this Condition 7(b), give a notice (a "Trigger Event 
Notice") to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) (x) if such 
Publication Date is an Ordinary Publication Date, within five Business Days of 
such Ordinary Publication Date (such fifth Business Day, the "Trigger Breach 
Determination Date", and the date of such notice, the "Ordinary Trigger 
Event Notice Date"), and (y) if such Publication Date is an Extraordinary 
Publication Date, on such Extraordinary Publication Date (the "Extraordinary 
Trigger Event Notice Date"), which notice shall:
(A) if such Trigger Event Notice is given prior to the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event (1) state that the Trigger CET1 
Ratio as of such Publication Date is less than the Threshold Ratio,
10279448089-v20 94 70-41069139
and a Contingent Write-down will take place, and (2) specify the date 
on which the Contingent Write-down will take place, which date shall, 
subject to postponement pursuant to subclause (ii) of this Condition 
7(b), be no later than 10 Business Days after the date of such notice (the 
"Trigger Event Write-down Date"); or
(B) if such Trigger Event Notice is given on or after the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, (1) state that the Trigger CET1 
Ratio as of such Publication Date is less than the Threshold Ratio, and a 
Conversion will take place, (2) specify the date on which the 
Conversion will take place, which date shall, subject to postponement 
pursuant to subclause (ii) of this Condition 7(b), be no more than 20 
Business Days after the date of such notice (the "Trigger Event 
Conversion Date"), (3) specify the Conversion Price in effect on the 
date of such Trigger Event Notice, and (4) specify the details of the 
arrangement for the settlement of the Conversion (including whether or 
not the Issuer will appoint a Settlement Shares Offer Agent to conduct a 
Settlement Shares Offer, the Suspension Date, the details of the 
Settlement Share Depository (including its Specified Office) or, if the 
Issuer is unable to appoint a Settlement Share Depository prior to 
giving of such notice, the other arrangements it has made in accordance 
with subclause (h)(i) of Condition 9 (Conversion) for the issuance and 
delivery of the Ordinary Shares to be issued and delivered upon 
Conversion to the Holders, the procedures Holders must follow to 
obtain delivery of the Ordinary Shares from the Settlement Share 
Depository, the Settlement Notice Cut-Off Date and the Final 
Cancellation Date).
(ii) If a Trigger Event Notice is required to be given pursuant to subclause (i) of this 
Condition 7(b), and on the relevant Publication Date any Higher-Trigger 
Contingent Capital is outstanding with respect to which either (x) no HigherTrigger Write-down/Conversion Notice has been given prior to the Trigger 
Event Notice Date or (y) a Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion Notice has 
been given prior to the Trigger Event Notice Date, but the Trigger Event Writedown Date or the Trigger Event Conversion Date, as applicable, is scheduled to 
occur prior to the relevant Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion Date,
(A) in the case of subclause (x) above, the giving of such Trigger Event 
Notice will be postponed until the date on which a Higher-Trigger Writedown/Conversion Notice has been given with respect to all such 
outstanding Higher-Trigger Contingent Capital and such date will be 
deemed to be the Trigger Event Notice Date; and
(B) in the case of subclauses (x) and (y) above, if the Trigger Event Writedown Date or the Trigger Event Conversion Date, as applicable, is 
scheduled to occur prior to the Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion 
Date (or, in the case of more than one Higher-Trigger Writedown/Conversion Date, the latest Higher-Trigger Writedown/Conversion Date), the Trigger Event Write-down Date or the 
Trigger Event Conversion Date, as applicable, will be postponed to the 
Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion Date (or the latest HigherTrigger Write-down/Conversion Date, as applicable) and such 
postponement shall be specified in such Trigger Event Notice.
(iii) If (A) a Trigger Event Notice is required to be given pursuant to subclause (i) of 
this Condition 7(b) in relation to an Ordinary Publication Date, and (B) prior to 
the earlier of the Ordinary Trigger Event Notice Date and the Trigger Breach 
Determination Date, FINMA, upon the request of UBS Group AG, has agreed in 
writing that a Contingent Write-down or a Conversion, as applicable, is not 
required as a result of actions taken by the Group or circumstances or events, in 
each case, that have had, or imminently will have, the effect of restoring the 
CET1 Ratio as of the Balance Sheet Date relating to the relevant Ordinary
10279448089-v20 95 70-41069139
Publication Date, after giving pro forma effect to such actions, circumstances or 
events, to a level above the Threshold Ratio that FINMA and UBS Group AG 
deem, in their sole discretion, to be adequate at such time, (x) the Issuer shall not 
give such Trigger Event Notice pursuant to subclause (i) of this Condition 7(b) in 
relation to the relevant Ordinary Publication Date, and (y) the Issuer shall give 
notice to the Holders on or prior to the Trigger Breach Determination Date in 
accordance with Condition 15 (Notices), which notice shall state that no 
Contingent Write-down or Conversion, as applicable, will occur in relation to the 
relevant Ordinary Publication Date.
(c) Viability Event
(i) Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 7, upon the occurrence of a Viability Event:
(A) the Issuer shall give notice (a "Viability Event Notice") to the Holders 
in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) within three days of the date 
on which such Viability Event occurred, which notice shall:
(1) if such Viability Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, (x) state that a Viability 
Event has occurred and a Contingent Write-down will take place 
and (y) specify the date on which the Contingent Write-down 
will take place, which date shall be no later than 10 Business 
Days after the date of such notice (such specified date, the 
"Viability Event Write-down Date"); or
(2) if such Viability Event occurs on or after the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, (w) state that a Viability 
Event has occurred and a Conversion will take place, (x) specify 
the date on which the Conversion will take place, which date 
shall be no more than 20 Business Days following the 
occurrence of the Viability Event (the "Viability Event 
Conversion Date"), (y) specify the Conversion Price in effect 
on the date of such Viability Event Notice, and (z) specify the 
details of the arrangements for the settlement of the Conversion 
(including the Suspension Date, the details of the Settlement 
Share Depository (including its Specified Office) or, if the Issuer 
is unable to appoint a Settlement Share Depository prior to 
giving of such notice, the other arrangements it has made in 
accordance with subclause (h)(i) of Condition 9 (Conversion) 
for the issuance and delivery of the Ordinary Shares to be issued 
and delivered upon Conversion to the Holders, the procedures 
Holders must follow to obtain delivery of the Ordinary Shares 
from the Settlement Share Depository, the Settlement Notice 
Cut-Off Date and the Final Cancellation Date); and
(B) if such Viability Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Contingent Write-down will occur on the 
applicable Viability Event Write-down Date in accordance Condition 8 
(Contingent Write-down); or
(C) if such Viability Event occurs on or after the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Conversion will occur on the applicable 
Viability Event Conversion Date in accordance with Condition 9 
(Conversion).
(ii) A "Viability Event" will have occurred if prior to an Alternative Loss Absorption 
Date (if any):
(A) FINMA has notified UBS Group AG in writing that it has determined a 
conversion or write-down, as applicable, of holders' claims in respect of
10279448089-v20 96 70-41069139
the Notes and all other capital instruments issued by, or other capital 
obligations (whether qualifying fully or partially for capital treatment) 
of, any member of the Group that, pursuant to their terms or by 
operation of law, are capable of being converted into equity or written 
down at that time, is, because customary measures to improve the 
Group Holding Company's capital adequacy are at the time inadequate 
or infeasible, an essential requirement to prevent the Group Holding 
Company from becoming insolvent, bankrupt, unable to pay a material 
part of its debts as they fall due or unable to carry on its business; or
(B) customary measures to improve the Group Holding Company's capital 
adequacy being at the time inadequate or infeasible, the Group Holding 
Company has received an irrevocable commitment of direct or indirect 
extraordinary support from the Public Sector (beyond customary 
transactions and arrangements in the ordinary course) that has, or 
imminently will have, the effect of improving the Group Holding 
Company's capital adequacy and without which, in the determination of 
(and as notified in writing by) FINMA, the Group Holding Company 
would have become insolvent, bankrupt, unable to pay a material part 
of its debts as they fall due or unable to carry on its business.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that a Viability Event may occur 
irrespective of whether or not a Trigger Event has occurred or whether any of 
the conditions to the issuance of a Trigger Event Notice have been met.
(d) Determination of CET1 Ratio and Trigger CET1 Ratio
With respect to any Publication Date, (i) the CET1 Ratio as of the relevant Balance Sheet 
Date, (ii) the Trigger CET1 Ratio as of such Publication Date and (iii) the components of 
both of the foregoing, in each case, as published on such Publication Date, will be final for 
purposes of this Condition 7, and any revisions, restatements or adjustments to any of the 
calculations described in subclauses (i) through (iii) of this clause (d) subsequently 
published will have no effect for purposes of this Condition 7.
(e) Alternative loss absorption
In the event of the implementation of any new, or amendment to or change in the 
interpretation of any existing, laws or components of National Regulations, in each case 
occurring after the Issue Date, that alone or together with any other law(s) or regulation(s) 
has, in the joint determination of UBS Group AG and FINMA, the effect that clause (c) 
of this Condition 7 could cease to apply to the Notes without giving rise to a Regulatory 
Event, then the Issuer shall give notice to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices) no later than five Business Days after such joint determination stating that such 
provisions will cease to apply from the date of such notice (the "Alternative Loss 
Absorption Date"), and from the date of such notice, such provisions will cease to apply 
to the Notes.
(f) Conversion Capital Availability Event
(i) A "Conversion Capital Availability Event" will have occurred on the first date 
after the Issue Date on which an amendment to the Articles of Association is 
registered in the main register (Hauptregister) of the Commercial Register 
(Handelsregister) of the Canton of Zurich as a result of which the Conversion 
Capital provided for in the Articles of Association meets or exceeds the Minimum 
Conversion Capital Availability Amount. For purposes of these Terms and 
Conditions, a Conversion Capital Availability Event may occur only once.
For purposes of the definition of Conversion Capital Availability Event:
"Articles of Association" means, at any time, the articles of association (Statuten) 
of UBS Group AG in effect at such time.
10279448089-v20 97 70-41069139
"Minimum Conversion Capital Availability Amount" means, at any time, the 
amount of Conversion Capital that UBS Group AG would require in order for it 
to create and issue:
(A) the number of Ordinary Shares into which the Notes outstanding at such 
time would be converted if they were to be converted at the Conversion 
Price in effect at such time and otherwise in accordance with these Terms 
and Conditions; and
(B) if any Other Tier 1 Contingent Convertible Capital Notes are outstanding 
at such time, the number of Ordinary Shares into which such Other Tier 1 
Contingent Convertible Capital Notes would be converted if they were 
to be converted at the conversion price then in effect pursuant to, and 
otherwise in accordance with, their respective terms at such time,
in each case, out of such Conversion Capital.
"Other Tier 1 Contingent Convertible Capital Note" means any capital 
instrument (other than the Notes) that:
(A) is eligible in full to be (x) treated as Additional Tier 1 Capital and
(y) counted towards either the Going-Concern LR Requirement or the 
Going-Concern RWA Requirement (or both); and
(B) subject to the terms and conditions thereof, is to be:
(x) converted into Ordinary Shares; or
(y) after a Conversion Capital Availability Event (or equivalent 
event described in the terms and conditions thereof) occurs, 
converted into Ordinary Shares,
in either case, when the CET1 Ratio (or equivalent capital measure of the 
Group described in the terms and conditions thereof) falls below a certain 
threshold and/or a Viability Event (or equivalent event described in the 
terms and conditions thereof) occurs.
As of 7 February 2024, the outstanding Other Tier 1 Contingent Convertible 
Capital Notes consisted of (1) the 9.250 per cent. Tier 1 Capital Notes (ISIN: 
US902613BF40 (144A); USH42097ES26 (Reg S)) issued by UBS Group AG in
an aggregate principal amount of USD 1,750,000,000 on 13 November 2023, and
(2) the 9.250 per cent. Tier 1 Capital Notes (ISIN: US902613BE74 (144A); 
USH42097ER43 (Reg S)) issued by UBS Group AG in an aggregate principal 
amount of USD 1,750,000,000 on 13 November 2023.
(ii) If a Conversion Capital Availability Event occurs at any time on or prior to a 
Trigger Event or a Viability Event, the Issuer shall as soon as practicable 
thereafter deliver to the Fiscal Agent and the Settlement Agent a certificate signed 
by the Authorised Signatories and notice to the Holders in accordance with 
Condition 15 (Notices), in each case stating that a Conversion Capital Availability 
Event has occurred and the date on which it occurred.
8. CONTINGENT WRITE-DOWN
If the Issuer has given a Trigger Event Write-down Notice or a Viability Event Write-down Notice 
in accordance with Condition 7 (Trigger Event and Viability Event), then on the relevant Writedown Date:
(a) the full principal amount of, and any accrued and unpaid interest (whether or not due and 
payable) on, each Note will automatically be written down to zero, the Notes will be 
cancelled and all references to the principal amount of the Notes in these Terms and 
Conditions will be construed accordingly;
10279448089-v20 98 70-41069139
(b) the Holders will be automatically deemed to have irrevocably waived their right to 
receive, and will no longer have any rights against the Issuer with respect to, repayment 
of the aggregate principal amount of, and payment of any accrued and unpaid interest on, 
the Notes written down pursuant to subclause (a) of this Condition 8 (bedingter 
Forderungsverzicht); and
(c) all rights of any Holder for payment of any amounts under or in respect of the Notes 
(including, without limitation, any amounts arising as a result of, or due and payable 
upon the occurrence of, an Event of Default) will become null and void, irrespective of 
whether such amounts have become due and payable prior to the date of the relevant 
Trigger Event Notice or Viability Event Notice, as the case may be, or the Write-down 
Date.
9. CONVERSION
(a) Conversion upon a Trigger Event or a Viability Event
If the Issuer has given a Trigger Event Conversion Notice or a Viability Event Conversion 
Notice in accordance with Condition 7 (Trigger Event and Viability Event), then:
(i) each Note shall, subject to and as provided in this Condition 9, be redeemed and 
settled (the "Conversion") on the applicable Conversion Date by (x) the delivery 
of new fully paid Ordinary Shares to the Settlement Share Depository on behalf 
of the Holders, and (y) the cancellation of any accrued and unpaid interest on the 
Notes (whether or not due and payable); and
(ii) receipt by the Settlement Share Depository of such number of Ordinary Shares as 
is required to satisfy in full its obligation to deliver Ordinary Shares in respect of 
the Conversion on the applicable Conversion Date shall be a good and complete 
discharge of the Issuer's (and, if UBS Group AG is not the Issuer, UBS Group 
AG's) obligations in respect of the Notes.
In the case of the Ordinary Shares to be delivered upon Conversion, as from the applicable 
Share Creation Date for such Ordinary Shares, there is no provision for the reconversion 
of such Ordinary Shares into Notes.
(b) Recourse for Ordinary Shares
Holders shall have recourse only to the Issuer for the issue and delivery of Ordinary Shares 
to the Settlement Share Depository pursuant to these Terms and Conditions. After such 
delivery to the Settlement Share Depository, Holders shall have recourse only to the 
Settlement Share Depository for the delivery to them of such Ordinary Shares or, in the 
circumstances described in clause (h) of this Condition 9, any cash amounts to which such 
Holders are entitled under clause (h) of this Condition 9.
(c) Conversion Price and determination of number of Ordinary Shares
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Conversion Event, as at the date on which the relevant 
Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice is 
published, each Holder shall be deemed to have accepted, and hereby accepts and 
agrees, (A) to the conversion of its holding of Notes into Ordinary Shares at the 
Conversion Price provided for herein and that, where necessary under Swiss law, 
the Settlement Agent shall effect such conversion on such Holder's behalf, and
(B) that its obligation to pay up the Ordinary Shares to be issued shall be set off 
against its claim for repayment of the principal amount upon redemption of the 
Notes, which claim shall be deemed to be due and payable immediately prior to 
the time on the Share Creation Date when, as a matter of Swiss law, the relevant 
Ordinary Shares are paid up. Such Ordinary Shares shall be paid up and issued on 
the Share Creation Date whereupon the Holders shall cease as a matter of Swiss 
law to be treated for all purposes under Swiss law as Holders and shall instead as 
of such date be treated for all purposes under Swiss law as Shareholders.
10279448089-v20 99 70-41069139
(ii) Subject to clause (g) of this Condition 9, the Issuer, with the assistance of the 
Settlement Agent, where necessary under Swiss law, shall issue and deliver to the 
Settlement Share Depository on the applicable Conversion Date such number of 
Ordinary Shares in respect of each Holder as is determined by the Settlement 
Agent by dividing the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by such Holder 
on the applicable Conversion Date by the Conversion Price in effect on the date 
of relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion 
Notice, as the case may be. The Settlement Agent shall determine such number 
of Ordinary Shares in accordance with this subclause (ii) as soon as practicable 
after publication of the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability 
Event Conversion Notice, as applicable.
(iii) The initial Conversion Price per Ordinary Share in respect of the Notes is 
specified in the definition thereof. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment 
to (and including) the date of the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or 
Viability Event Conversion Notice, as the case may be, in the circumstances 
described in clause (d) below.
(d) Anti-dilution adjustment of the Conversion Price
(i) Upon the occurrence of any of the events described below after 7 February 2024, 
the Conversion Price will be adjusted by the Issuer as follows:
(A) If there is a consolidation, reclassification, redesignation or subdivision 
in relation to the Ordinary Shares that alters the number of Ordinary 
Shares in issue, the Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the 
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such consolidation, 
reclassification, redesignation or subdivision by the following fraction:
where:
A is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately before such consolidation, reclassification, 
redesignation or subdivision, as the case may be; and
B is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately after, and as a result of, such consolidation, 
reclassification, redesignation or subdivision, as the case may 
be.
Such adjustment will become effective on the date on which the 
consolidation, reclassification, redesignation or subdivision, as the case 
may be, takes effect.
(B) If UBS Group AG issues any Ordinary Shares to Shareholders as a class 
credited as fully paid by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves 
(including any share premium account or capital redemption reserve) 
other than (x) where any such Ordinary Shares are or are to be issued 
instead of the whole or part of a Cash Distribution that the Shareholders 
would or could otherwise have elected to receive, (y) where the 
Shareholders may elect to receive a Cash Distribution in lieu of such 
Ordinary Shares or (z) where any such Ordinary Shares are or are 
expressed to be issued in lieu of a dividend (whether or not a Cash 
Distribution equivalent or amount is announced or would otherwise be 
payable to the Shareholders, whether at their election or otherwise), the 
Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price 
in force immediately prior to such issue by the following fraction:
10279448089-v20 100 70-41069139
where:
A is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately before such issue; and
B is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately after such issue.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of issue of such 
Ordinary Shares.
(C) If UBS Group AG makes or pays an Extraordinary Distribution to 
Shareholders, the Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the 
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the Effective Date by the 
following fraction:
where:
A is the Current Market Price of one Ordinary Share on the 
Effective Date (translated, if necessary, into the Relevant 
Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the Effective Date); and
B is the portion of the aggregate Extraordinary Distribution 
attributable to one Ordinary Share, with such portion being 
determined by dividing the aggregate Extraordinary 
Distribution by the number of Ordinary Shares entitled to 
receive the relevant Extraordinary Distribution. If the 
Extraordinary Distribution shall be expressed in a currency 
other than the Relevant Currency, it shall be converted into the 
Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the relevant 
Effective Date.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date.
For purposes of this subclause (C), "Effective Date" means (x) the first 
date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-the Extraordinary 
Distribution on the Relevant Stock Exchange or (y) if there is no 
Relevant Stock Exchange, the first date upon which the adjusted 
Conversion Price is capable of being determined in accordance with this 
subclause (C).
(D) If UBS Group AG issues Ordinary Shares to Shareholders as a class by 
way of rights or UBS Group AG or any other member of the Group or 
(at the direction or request or pursuant to arrangements with UBS Group 
AG or any other member of the Group) any other Person issues or grants 
to Shareholders as a class by way of rights, any options, warrants or other 
rights to subscribe for or purchase Ordinary Shares, or any Securities that 
by their terms of issue carry (directly or indirectly) rights of conversion 
into, or exchange or subscription for, any Ordinary Shares (or shall grant 
any such rights in respect of existing Securities so issued), in each case 
at a price per Ordinary Share that is less than 95 per cent. of the Current 
Market Price per Ordinary Share on the Effective Date (translated, if 
necessary, into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the 
Effective Date), the Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the
10279448089-v20 101 70-41069139
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the Effective Date by the 
following fraction:
where:
A is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue on the Effective Date;
B is the number of Ordinary Shares that the aggregate 
consideration (if any) receivable for the Ordinary Shares issued 
by way of rights, or for the Securities issued by way of rights, 
or for the options or warrants or other rights issued by way of 
rights and for the total number of Ordinary Shares deliverable 
on the exercise thereof, would purchase at such Current Market 
Price per Ordinary Share on the Effective Date (translated, if 
necessary, into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on 
the Effective Date); and
C is the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or the maximum 
number of Ordinary Shares that may be issued upon exercise of 
such options, warrants or rights calculated as at the date of issue 
of such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion or 
exchange or exercise of rights of subscription or purchase in 
respect thereof at the initial conversion, exchange, subscription 
or purchase price or rate, as the case may be,
provided that, if on the Effective Date, such number of Ordinary Shares 
is to be determined by reference to the application of a formula or other 
variable feature or the occurrence of any event at some subsequent time, 
then for the purposes of this subclause (D), "C" will be determined by the 
application of such formula or variable feature or as if the relevant event 
occurs or had occurred as at the Effective Date and as if such conversion, 
exchange, subscription, purchase or acquisition had taken place on the 
Effective Date.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date.
For purposes of this subclause (D), "Effective Date" means (x) the first 
date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-rights, ex-options or exwarrants on the Relevant Stock Exchange or (y) if there is no Relevant 
Stock Exchange, the first date upon which the adjusted Conversion Price 
is capable of being determined in accordance with this subclause (D).
For purposes of any calculation of the consideration receivable or price 
pursuant to this subclause (D), the following provisions shall apply:
(1) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary 
Shares issued for cash shall be the amount of such cash;
(2) (x) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary 
Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the 
conversion or exchange of any Securities will be deemed to be 
the consideration or price received or receivable for any such 
Securities and (y) the aggregate consideration receivable or 
price for Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made 
available upon the exercise of rights of subscription attached to 
any Securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or 
rights will be deemed to be that part (which may be the whole)
10279448089-v20 102 70-41069139
of the consideration or price received or receivable for such 
Securities or, as the case may be, for such options, warrants or 
rights that are attributed by UBS Group AG to such rights of 
subscription or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or 
rights or, if no part of such consideration or price is so attributed, 
the Fair Market Value of such rights of subscription or, as the 
case may be, such options, warrants or rights as at the relevant 
Effective Date, plus in the case of each of subclauses (x) and (y) 
above, the additional minimum consideration receivable or price 
(if any) upon the conversion or exchange of such Securities, or 
upon the exercise of such rights or subscription attached thereto 
or, as the case may be, upon exercise of such options, warrants 
or rights, and (z) the consideration receivable or price per 
Ordinary Share upon the conversion or exchange of, or upon the 
exercise of such rights of subscription attached to, such 
Securities or, as the case may be, upon the exercise of such 
options, warrants or rights will be the aggregate consideration or 
price referred to in subclause (x) or (y) above (as the case may 
be) divided by the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued upon 
such conversion or exchange or exercise at the initial 
conversion, exchange or subscription price or rate;
(3) if the consideration or price determined pursuant to 
subclause (1) or (2) above (or any component thereof) is 
expressed in a currency other than the Relevant Currency, it shall 
be converted into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate 
on the relevant Effective Date (in the case of subclause (1) 
above) or the relevant date of first public announcement (in the 
case of subclause (2) above);
(4) in determining the consideration or price pursuant to the above, 
no deduction shall be made for any commissions or fees 
(howsoever described) or any expenses paid or incurred for any 
underwriting, placing or management of the issue of the relevant 
Ordinary Shares or Securities or options, warrants or rights, or 
otherwise in connection therewith; and
(5) the consideration or price shall be determined as provided above 
on the basis of the consideration or price received, receivable, 
paid or payable, regardless of whether all or part thereof is 
received, receivable, paid or payable by or to UBS Group AG or 
another entity.
(E) If UBS Group AG determines, in its sole discretion, that, notwithstanding 
subclauses (A) to (D) of this Condition 9(d)(i), a reduction to the 
Conversion Price should be made as a result of one or more events or 
circumstances not referred to in this Condition 9(d)(i) that would require 
an adjustment to the Conversion Price in order to comply with Swiss 
mandatory law on the protection of holders of instruments that may 
convert into shares issued out of capital range (Kapitalband), conditional 
capital (bedingtes Kapital) or Conversion Capital, the Conversion Price 
will be reduced (either generally or for a specified period) in such manner 
and with effect from such date as UBS Group AG shall determine and 
the Issuer shall notify to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices).
(ii) Notwithstanding Condition 9(d)(i):
(A) where
10279448089-v20 103 70-41069139
(1) the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment to the 
Conversion Price have resulted or will result in an adjustment to 
the Conversion Price; or
(2) more than one event that gives rise to an adjustment to the 
Conversion Price occurs within such a short period of time,
that, in the opinion of UBS Group AG, a modification to the operation of 
the adjustment provisions set forth in this Condition 9(d) is required to 
give the intended result, such modification will be made to the operation 
of the adjustment provisions set forth in this Condition 9(d) as may be 
determined by an Independent Adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to 
give the intended result, including to ensure that (x) an adjustment to the 
Conversion Price or the economic effect thereof shall not be taken into 
account more than once, (y) the economic effect of an Extraordinary 
Distribution is not taken into account more than once, and (z) to reflect a 
redenomination of the issued Ordinary Shares for the time being into a 
new currency;
(B) any adjustment to the Conversion Price will be subject to such 
Conversion Price (translated, if necessary, into the currency in which 
the par value of an Ordinary Share is denominated at the time such 
adjustment becomes effective at the then-prevailing exchange rate as 
determined by the Issuer) not being less than the par value of an 
Ordinary Share at such time;
(C) UBS Group AG shall not take any action, and shall procure that no 
action is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the 
Conversion Price (translated, if necessary, into the currency in which 
the par value of an Ordinary Share is denominated at the time of such 
action at the then- prevailing exchange rate as determined by the Issuer) 
to below the par value of an Ordinary Share then in effect;
(D) if any doubt arises as to whether an adjustment is to be made to the 
Conversion Price or as to the appropriate adjustment to the Conversion 
Price, the Issuer may in its sole discretion appoint an Independent 
Adviser and, following consultation between the Issuer and such 
Independent Adviser, a written opinion of such Independent Adviser in 
respect thereof will (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith and 
manifest error) be conclusive and binding on the Issuer and the Holders;
(E) no adjustment will be made to the Conversion Price where Ordinary 
Shares or other securities (including rights, warrants and options) are 
issued, offered, exercised, allotted, purchased, appropriated, modified or 
granted to, or for the benefit of, employees or former employees 
(including directors holding or formerly holding executive office or the 
personal service company of any such person) or their spouses or 
relatives, in each case, of UBS Group AG or any of its subsidiaries or 
any associated company or to a trustee or trustees to be held for the 
benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to any share or 
option scheme; and
(F) on any adjustment, if the resultant Conversion Price has more decimal 
places than the initial Conversion Price, it will be rounded to the same 
number of decimal places as the initial Conversion Price. No adjustment 
will be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded 
down if applicable) would be less than one per cent. of the Conversion 
Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any 
amount by which the Conversion Price has been rounded down, will be 
carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and 
such subsequent adjustment will be made on the basis that the adjustment
10279448089-v20 104 70-41069139
not required to be made had been made at the relevant time and/or that 
the relevant rounding down had not been made, as the case may be.
(iii) The Issuer shall give notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price made 
pursuant to this Condition 9(d) to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices) promptly after the determination thereof.
(iv) References in these Terms and Conditions to any issue or offer or grant to 
Shareholders "as a class" or "by way of rights" shall be taken to be references to 
an issue or offer or grant to all or substantially all Shareholders, other than 
Shareholders to whom, by reason of the laws of any territory or requirements of 
any recognised regulatory body or any other stock exchange or securities market 
in any territory or in connection with fractional entitlements, it is determined not 
to make such issue or offer or grant.
(e) Qualifying Relevant Event
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Relevant Event that is a Qualifying Relevant Event, 
then:
(A) upon the occurrence of a Conversion Event where the applicable 
Conversion Date falls on or after the New Conversion Condition 
Effective Date,
(1) the Notes shall be converted on such Conversion Date into, or 
be exchanged on such Conversion Date for, as the case may be, 
Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity, mutatis mutandis as 
provided in accordance with this Condition 9, at a Conversion 
Price that shall be the New Conversion Price; and
(2) the Issuer shall procure the issue and/or delivery of the relevant 
number of Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity in the manner 
provided in this Condition 9 (as may be amended as described 
in the definition of the term New Conversion Condition); and
(B) the New Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment in the 
circumstances provided in this Condition 9 for the adjustment of the 
Conversion Price (if necessary with such amendments as an Independent 
Adviser shall determine to be appropriate) and the Issuer shall give notice 
in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) to the Holders of the New 
Conversion Price and of any such amendments thereafter.
(ii) Upon the occurrence of a Relevant Event, the Issuer shall give notice thereof to 
the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) within 10 Business Days 
following the occurrence of such Relevant Event, which notice shall:
(A) specify the identity of the Acquiror;
(B) specify whether the Relevant Event is a Qualifying Relevant Event or a 
Non-Qualifying Relevant Event;
(C) in the case of a Qualifying Relevant Event, specify the New Conversion 
Price; and
(D) if applicable, specify the New Conversion Condition Effective Date.
(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, upon the occurrence of a Relevant Event that is a 
Non-Qualifying Relevant Event, the provisions of this clause (e) shall (subject to 
the subsequent operation of this clause (e) upon the occurrence of a subsequent 
Relevant Event) not apply, and the Notes will continue to be convertible into 
Ordinary Shares pursuant to and in accordance with the other provisions of this 
Condition 9 (Conversion), if and when the Issuer gives a Trigger Event
10279448089-v20 105 70-41069139
Conversion Notice or a Viability Event Conversion Notice in accordance with 
Condition 7 (Trigger Event and Viability Event).
(iv) For purposes of these Terms and Conditions:
"Acquiror" means the Person (including a Governmental Entity) that, following 
a Relevant Event, controls UBS Group AG.
"Approved Entity" means an Acquiror that is body corporate that is 
incorporated or established under the laws of an OECD member state and that, 
on the occurrence of the Relevant Event, has in issue Relevant Shares.
"Governmental Entity" means (x) the Swiss Confederation, (y) an agency of the 
Swiss Confederation or (z) a person or entity (other than a body corporate) 
controlled by the Swiss Confederation or any such agency referred to in clause (y); 
provided, however, that, if UBS Group AG is at any time organised in a 
jurisdiction outside of Switzerland, references in this definition to "the Swiss 
Confederation" shall be read as references to the government of such other 
jurisdiction.
The "New Conversion Condition" shall be satisfied in respect of a Relevant 
Event if, by no later than seven days following the occurrence of such Relevant 
Event, (x) UBS Group AG has, to the satisfaction of UBS Group AG, entered into 
arrangements with the Approved Entity that provide for delivery of Relevant 
Shares of the Approved Entity on Conversion on terms mutatis mutandis as 
provided in the provisions of this Condition 9, and (y) the Issuer has entered into 
such agreements and arrangements, and made such amendments to these Terms 
and Conditions, as may be required to ensure that, with effect from the New 
Conversion Condition Effective Date, the Notes shall, following the occurrence of 
a Conversion Event, be convertible into, or exchangeable for, Relevant Shares of 
the Approved Entity, mutatis mutandis in accordance with, and subject to, this 
Condition 9 (as may be so amended) at the New Conversion Price; provided, 
however, that, any failure to enter into the arrangements and agreements and/or 
make the amendments described in clauses (x) and (y) shall not constitute a 
default or an Event of Default under these Terms and Conditions.
"New Conversion Condition Effective Date" means the date with effect from 
which the New Conversion Condition has been satisfied.
"New Conversion Price" means, in respect of any Conversion Date falling on or 
after the New Conversion Condition Effective Date, the amount determined by the 
Issuer in accordance with the following formula:
where:
NCP is the New Conversion Price.
ECP is the Conversion Price in effect on the last dealing day prior 
to the New Conversion Condition Effective Date.
VWAPRS is the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the 
Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity (translated, if 
necessary, into USD at the Prevailing Rate on the relevant 
dealing day) on each of the five dealing days ending on the 
last dealing day prior to the date on which the Relevant 
Event occurred (and where references in the definition of 
"Volume Weighted
10279448089-v20 106 70-41069139
Average Price" to "Ordinary Shares" shall be construed as a 
reference to the Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity and 
in the definition of "dealing day", references to the "Relevant 
Stock Exchange" shall be to the primary Recognised Stock 
Exchange on which the Relevant Shares of the Approved 
Entity are then listed, admitted to trading or accepted for 
dealing).
VWAPOS is the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the 
Ordinary Shares (translated, if necessary, into USD at the 
Prevailing Rate on the relevant dealing day) on each of the 
five dealing days ending on the last dealing day prior to the 
date on which the Relevant Event occurred.
"Non-Qualifying Relevant Event" means a Relevant Event that is not a 
Qualifying Relevant Event.
"Qualifying Relevant Event" means a Relevant Event where:
(A) the Acquiror is an Approved Entity; and
(B) the New Conversion Condition is satisfied.
A "Relevant Event" will have occurred if, on or after the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, any Person or Persons acting in concert 
acquires control of UBS Group AG (other than as a result of an Exempt 
Reorganisation). For the purposes of this definition "Relevant Event", "control" 
means the acquisition or holding of legal or beneficial ownership of more than 95 
per cent. of the issued Ordinary Shares of UBS Group AG (whether obtained 
directly or indirectly and whether obtained by ownership of share capital, contract 
or otherwise) and, as a consequence thereof, the Ordinary Shares are no longer 
admitted to trading on any Recognised Stock Exchange, and "controlled" shall be 
construed accordingly.
"Relevant Shares" means, in respect of an Acquiror, ordinary share capital of 
such Acquiror that constitutes equity share capital or the equivalent (or depositary 
or other receipts representing the same) that is listed and admitted to trading on a 
Recognised Stock Exchange.
(f) Procedure for settlement and delivery of Ordinary Shares on Conversion
Ordinary Shares to be issued on Conversion shall be delivered subject to and as provided 
below.
(g) Fractions
Fractions of Ordinary Shares will not be issued or delivered pursuant to these Terms and 
Conditions on Conversion and no cash payment will be made in lieu thereof. The number 
of Ordinary Shares to be issued and delivered to the Settlement Share Depository for the 
benefit of each Holder in respect of a Conversion shall be calculated by the Settlement 
Agent on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by such Holder on the 
applicable Conversion Date and rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number 
of Ordinary Shares.
(h) Procedure for delivery in respect of a Conversion
(i) UBS Group AG, with the assistance of the Settlement Agent where necessary 
under Swiss law, shall on or prior to the applicable Conversion Date issue and 
deliver to the Settlement Share Depository such number of Ordinary Shares as is 
required to satisfy in full its obligation to deliver Ordinary Shares to the Holders 
in respect of the Conversion on the applicable Conversion Date. Receipt by the
10279448089-v20 107 70-41069139
Settlement Share Depository of such Ordinary Shares shall be a good and 
complete discharge of the Issuer's (and, if UBS Group AG is not the Issuer, UBS 
Group AG's) obligations in respect of the Notes. If the Issuer is unable to appoint 
a Settlement Share Depository on or prior to the giving of the Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice, as the case may be, it 
shall make such other arrangements for the issuance and delivery of the Ordinary 
Shares to be issued and delivered upon Conversion to the Holders as it considers, 
in its sole discretion, to be reasonable in the circumstances, which may include 
issuing and delivering such Ordinary Shares to another independent nominee to 
be held on trust for the Holders or issuing and delivering such Ordinary Shares to 
the Holders directly, which issuance and delivery shall irrevocably discharge and 
satisfy all of the Issuer's obligations under the Notes as if the relevant Ordinary 
Shares had been issued and delivered to the Settlement Share Depository 
and, in which case, where the context so admits, references in these 
Terms and Conditions to the issue and delivery of Ordinary Shares to the 
Settlement Share Depository shall be construed accordingly and apply 
mutatis mutandis.
(ii) Subject to the making of a Settlement Shares Offer and as otherwise provided 
herein, the Settlement Agent shall give instructions to the Settlement Share 
Depository for the relevant Ordinary Shares to be delivered by the Settlement 
Share Depository on the applicable Settlement Date to the Holders, and the 
Settlement Share Depository shall procure that the Ordinary Shares are so 
delivered to the Holders on the applicable Settlement Date.
(iii) In respect of a Conversion as a result of the occurrence of a Trigger Event only, 
following receipt by the Settlement Share Depository of the Ordinary Shares and 
the resulting good and complete discharge of the Issuer's obligations in respect 
of the Notes as described in subclause (i) above, the Issuer may, in its sole 
discretion, appoint a placement agent (the "Settlement Shares Offer Agent") 
acting on behalf, and for the accounts, of the Holders to conduct an offering of 
the Ordinary Shares to which the Holders are otherwise entitled (a "Settlement 
Shares Offer"). In the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice, the Issuer 
shall notify the Holders whether it will appoint such Settlement Shares Offer 
Agent to conduct such a Settlement Shares Offer. If it does so appoint a 
Settlement Shares Offer Agent, it will instruct the Settlement Share Depository 
to deliver the relevant Ordinary Shares to or to the order of the Settlement 
Shares Offer Agent for this purpose prior to the end of the Offer Settlement 
Period. Such Settlement Shares Offer shall be made (x) in the currency of the 
Issuer's choosing and at a cash price per Ordinary Share (such price translated, if 
necessary, into USD at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the Trigger 
Event Conversion Notice as determined by the Issuer) equal to the Conversion 
Price in effect on the date of the Trigger Event Conversion Notice, and (y) to 
some or, subject to applicable laws and regulations and to such an offer being 
practicable in the opinion of the Issuer in the Offer Settlement Period, all 
Shareholders on the record date of the Trigger Event Conversion Notice then 
eligible to participate in such offer. Any such Settlement Shares Offer shall be 
completed no later than 20 Business Days after the occurrence of the Trigger 
Event (the "Offer Settlement Period"). Neither the Issuer nor the Settlement 
Share Depository shall incur any liability whatsoever to the Holders in respect of 
the appointment of such Settlement Shares Offer Agent or its conduct, save for 
cases of gross negligence or wilful intent.
If the Settlement Shares Offer is fully subscribed by or before the end of the Offer 
Settlement Period, the Holders shall, pursuant to the agreement appointing the 
Settlement Shares Offer Agent, be entitled to receive from the Settlement Shares 
Offer Agent on the fifth Business Day after the end of the Offer Settlement Period, 
their pro rata share of the aggregate cash proceeds received from the Settlement 
Shares Offer (such aggregate cash proceeds translated, if necessary, from the 
currency in which they are denominated into USD at the then-prevailing exchange 
rate as determined by the Settlement Shares Offer Agent (less any foreign 
exchange transaction costs)), such amount being rounded to the nearest cent (half 
a cent being rounded upwards). If the Settlement Shares Offer is only partially
10279448089-v20 108 70-41069139
subscribed by the end of the Offer Settlement Period, the Holders shall
(x) pursuant to the agreement appointing the Settlement Shares Offer Agent, be 
entitled to receive from the Settlement Shares Offer Agent on the fifth Business 
Day after the end of the Offer Settlement Period, their pro rata share of the 
aggregate cash proceeds received from the Settlement Shares Offer (such 
aggregate cash proceeds translated, if necessary, from the currency in which they 
are denominated into USD at the then-prevailing exchange rate as determined by 
the Settlement Shares Offer Agent (less any foreign exchange transaction costs)), 
such amount being rounded to the nearest cent (half a cent being rounded 
upwards), and (y) be entitled to receive their pro rata share of the number of 
Ordinary Shares not subscribed pursuant to the Settlement Shares Offer (rounded 
down to the nearest whole number of such Ordinary Shares) within the period 
specified below from the Settlement Share Depository. If no Ordinary Shares are 
subscribed in the Settlement Shares Offer, Holders shall be entitled to receive the 
relevant Ordinary Shares within the period specified below from the Settlement 
Share Depository. Notwithstanding Condition 10 (Payments; Agents), any cash 
proceeds that the Holders are entitled to receive pursuant to this subclause (iii) 
shall be delivered to the Holders in accordance with clause (j) of this Condition 9.
In relation to any Ordinary Shares not sold pursuant to a Settlement Shares Offer, 
the Settlement Agent shall give instructions to the Settlement Shares Offer Agent 
for such Ordinary Shares to be delivered by the Settlement Shares Offer Agent to 
the relevant Holders within five Business Days after the end of the Offer 
Settlement Period.
(i) Taxes and duties
None of the Issuer, any other member of the Group, any Agent, the Settlement Share 
Depository and the US Transfer Agent will pay any capital, stamp, issue, registration, 
transfer or other taxes or duties arising upon Conversion or that may arise or be paid as a 
consequence of or in connection with the issue and delivery of Ordinary Shares to the 
Settlement Share Depository or the delivery of any Ordinary Shares to the relevant 
recipient in accordance with the instructions given in the relevant Settlement Shares 
Settlement Notice. A Holder must pay any capital, stamp, issue, registration, transfer or 
other taxes or duties arising upon Conversion or that may arise or be paid as a consequence 
of or in connection with the issue and delivery of the Ordinary Shares to the Settlement 
Share Depository or the delivery of the Ordinary Shares to the relevant recipient in 
accordance with the instructions given in the relevant Settlement Shares Settlement 
Notice, and such Holder must pay all, if any, such taxes and duties arising by reference to 
any disposal or deemed disposal of such Holder's Notes or interest therein. Any capital, 
stamp, issue, registration, transfer or other taxes or duties arising on delivery or transfer 
of Ordinary Shares to a purchaser in any Settlement Shares Offer shall be payable by the 
relevant purchaser of those Ordinary Shares.
(j) Delivery of Ordinary Shares and cash proceeds received from a Settlement Shares Offer
UBS Group AG, with the assistance of the Settlement Agent where necessary under Swiss 
law, will issue and deliver the Ordinary Shares required to be issued and delivered on 
Conversion to the Settlement Share Depository on behalf of the Holder of the relevant 
Note(s). The Issuer (or another party so authorised by the Issuer) shall instruct the US 
Transfer Agent to credit such Ordinary Shares to a nominee account in the name of the 
Settlement Share Depository to be held on behalf of the Holders on the applicable 
Conversion Date. Receipt by the Settlement Share Depository of such Ordinary Shares on 
the applicable Conversion Date shall be a good and complete discharge of the Issuer's 
obligations in respect of the Notes as described in subclause (h)(i) of this Condition 9.
In order to obtain delivery from the Settlement Share Depository of the Ordinary Shares 
and/or cash proceeds received from a Settlement Shares Offer, in each case to which it is 
entitled pursuant to this Condition 9, a Holder will be required to deliver to the Settlement 
Share Depository (or any of its agent designated for such purpose in the Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice, as applicable) an executed
10279448089-v20 109 70-41069139
settlement shares settlement notice substantially in the form that may be obtained from 
the Specified Office of the Settlement Agent (a "Settlement Shares Settlement Notice") 
and the relevant Certificate representing the relevant Note to the Settlement Share 
Depository (or any of its agents designated for such purpose in the Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice) on or before the Settlement 
Notice Cut-off Date. If such Settlement Shares Settlement Notice or Certificate is 
delivered after the end of normal business hours at the Specified Office of the Settlement 
Share Depository, such delivery shall be deemed for all purposes to have been made or 
given on the following New York Business Day. The Settlement Shares Settlement 
Notice must contain certain information, including the name of the relevant recipient in 
which the relevant Ordinary Shares are to be registered directly on the books of the US 
Transfer, and Settlement Shares Settlement Notices and Certificates must be delivered to 
the Settlement Share Depository (or any of its agents designated for such purpose in the 
Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice, as applicable) in 
accordance with the procedures described in the relevant Trigger Event Conversion 
Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice, as applicable; provided, however, that, if 
the Notes are represented by one or more Global Certificates deposited with, or with a 
custodian for, the Depositary, then the Settlement Shares Settlement Notice must be 
given in accordance with the standard procedures of the Depositary (which may include, 
without limitation, delivery of the notice to the Settlement Share Depository by 
electronic means) and in a form acceptable to the Depositary, the Settlement Agent and 
the Settlement Share Depository. Subject as otherwise provided herein, the relevant 
Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds of a Settlement Shares Offer will be delivered by 
or on behalf of the Settlement Share Depository or the Settlement Shares Offer Agent, as 
applicable, in accordance with the instructions given in the relevant Settlement Shares 
Settlement Notice; provided, however, that, if the Notes are represented by one or more 
Global Certificates deposited with, or with a custodian for, the Depositary, then delivery 
of any such cash proceeds shall be made by the Settlement Shares Offer Agent in 
accordance with the Depositary's practices from time to time.
If a Holder delivers a valid Settlement Shares Settlement Notice and the relevant 
Certificate on or before the Settlement Notice Cut-off Date, then the Ordinary Shares will 
be delivered in respect of the relevant Note(s) by way of registering the Ordinary Shares in 
the name of the relevant recipient directly on the books of the US Transfer Agent on the 
applicable Settlement Date or such other date as is specified for delivery. Once Ordinary 
Shares are registered in the name of the relevant recipient directly on the books of the US 
Transfer Agent, such relevant recipient, as Shareholder, is expected to receive periodic 
account statements from the US Transfer Agent with respect to its Ordinary Shares. At the 
time of delivery of any Ordinary Shares to the relevant recipient by registration of such 
Ordinary Shares directly on the books of the US Transfer Agent, the then-valid share 
registration rules of UBS Group AG will apply, and UBS Group AG does not offer any 
assurance or guarantee that such relevant recipient will be accepted as a Shareholder with 
voting rights in the share register of UBS Group AG.
If a Holder fails to deliver a Settlement Shares Settlement Notice or the relevant Certificate 
on or before the Settlement Notice Cut-off Date or if a Holder has delivered a Settlement 
Shares Settlement Notice and the relevant Certificate on or prior the Settlement Notice 
Cut-off Date but such Settlement Shares Settlement Notice has been determined by the 
Settlement Share Depository to be null and void, then the Settlement Share Depository 
shall continue to hold the relevant Ordinary Shares and/or, as applicable, cash proceeds 
received from a Settlement Shares Offer, in each case to which such Holder is entitled 
pursuant to this Condition 9, until a valid Settlement Shares Settlement Notice (and the 
Certificate representing the relevant Notes) is so delivered by such Holder. If any such 
Ordinary Shares or such cash proceeds received from a Settlement Shares Offer (as 
applicable) have not been claimed during the 10-year and 30-day period commencing on 
the Final Cancellation Date, the relevant claims of the applicable Holders are time-barred 
and the relevant Ordinary Shares and cash, as the case may be, will be transferred to the 
Issuer. None of the Issuer, the Settlement Share Depository and the Settlement Shares 
Offer Agent shall have any liability to any Holder for any loss resulting from such Holder 
not receiving any such Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds.
10279448089-v20 110 70-41069139
If not previously cancelled on the applicable Settlement Date, the relevant Notes shall be 
cancelled on the Final Cancellation Date and any Holder delivering a Settlement Shares 
Settlement Notice after the Settlement Notice Cut-off Date will have to provide evidence 
of its entitlement to the relevant Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds from a Settlement 
Shares Offer, as applicable, satisfactory to the Settlement Share Depository in its sole 
discretion in order to receive delivery of such Ordinary Shares or such cash proceeds, as 
applicable. None of the Issuer, the Settlement Share Depository and the Settlement Shares 
Offer Agent shall have any liability to any Holder for any loss resulting from such Holder 
not receiving any Ordinary Shares or cash proceeds from a Settlement Shares Offer, as 
applicable, or from any delay in the receipt thereof, in each case as a result of such Holder 
failing to submit a valid Settlement Shares Settlement Notice and any relevant Certificate 
(if applicable), on a timely basis or at all.
Any determination as to whether any Settlement Shares Settlement Notice has been 
properly completed and delivered together with the relevant Certificate(s) as provided in 
these Terms and Conditions, or whether any evidence of entitlement to Ordinary Shares or 
cash proceeds received from a Settlement Shares Offer, as applicable, is satisfactory, shall 
be made by the Settlement Share Depository in its sole discretion and shall be conclusive 
and binding on the relevant Holders. In the case of Notes represented by a Global 
Certificate, any Settlement Shares Settlement Notice delivered prior to the day following 
the Suspension Date will be null and void.
(k) Ordinary Shares
The Ordinary Shares issued and delivered on Conversion will be fully paid and nonassessable and will in all respects rank pari passu with the fully paid Ordinary Shares in 
issue on the relevant Share Creation Date, except in any such case for any right excluded 
by mandatory provisions of applicable law, and except that the Ordinary Shares so issued 
and delivered will not rank for (or, as the case may be, the relevant Holder will not be 
entitled to receive) any rights, distributions or payments the record date or other due date 
for the establishment of entitlement for which falls prior to the relevant Share Creation 
Date.
All Ordinary Shares issued and delivered to Holders upon Conversion are expected to be 
"restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the US Securities Act, and 
accordingly, any Holder who receives Ordinary Shares upon Conversion will be subject 
to restrictions under the US Securities Act on its ability to resell such Ordinary Shares. 
Subject to applicable law and the policies and procedures of the US Transfer Agent from 
time to time, through the US Transfer Agent, Holders who receive Ordinary Shares upon 
Conversion are expected to be able to effect transfers of such Ordinary Shares with other 
Shareholders holding their Ordinary Shares through the US Transfer Agent, or with 
Shareholders holding their Ordinary Shares via DTC through custodian banks or brokers 
by means of DTC's Direct Registration System.
(l) Purchase or redemption of Ordinary Shares
UBS Group AG or any of its subsidiaries may exercise such rights as it may from time to 
time enjoy to purchase or redeem or buy back any shares or securities of UBS Group AG 
(including Ordinary Shares) or any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing 
the same without the consent of Holders.
(m) Determinations to be made by an Independent Adviser
In the case of any determination that is required to be made by an Independent Adviser 
for purposes of this Condition 9, the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint an 
Independent Adviser to make such determination; provided, however, that, 
notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions, if the Issuer is 
unable to so appoint an Independent Adviser or the Independent Adviser so appointed by 
the Issuer fails to make such determination, the Issuer, acting in good faith and a 
commercially reasonable manner, will make such determination.
10279448089-v20 111 70-41069139
Any determination that is made by an Independent Adviser for purposes of this 
Condition 9 will be made in the sole discretion of such Independent Adviser acting in 
good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
(n) Notifications, etc. to be final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and 
decisions given, expressed, made or obtained by an Independent Adviser or the Settlement 
Agent for purposes of this Condition 9 will (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith and 
manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Agents and the Holders and (in the absence 
of wilful default and bad faith) no liability to the Issuer or the Holders will attach to the 
Independent Adviser or the Settlement Agent in connection with the exercise or nonexercise by the Independent Adviser or the Settlement Agent of its powers, duties and 
discretions under this Condition 9.
10. PAYMENTS; AGENTS
(a) All payments required to be made under the Notes will be made available in good time 
in freely disposable funds in USD, which will be placed at the free disposal of the Fiscal 
Agent on behalf of the Holders. If the Scheduled Due Date for any payment (whether in 
respect of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of the Notes is not a Payment 
Business Day, then the Holders will not be entitled to payment thereof until the first 
Payment Business Day following the Scheduled Due Date, and the Holders will not be 
entitled to any additional sum in relation to such payment. All payments required to be 
made under the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Additional Amounts) 
shall be made to the Holders in USD without collection costs, without any restrictions 
and whatever the circumstances may be, irrespective of nationality, domicile or 
residence of the relevant Holder and without certification, affidavit or the fulfilment of 
any other formality; provided, however, that, in the case of Notes represented by 
Definitive Certificates, such Definitive Certificates must be presented and, in the case of 
redemption, surrendered at the Specified Office of the relevant Paying Agent as a 
condition to receipt of any such payment.
(b) The receipt by the Fiscal Agent of the due and punctual payment of funds in USD will 
release the Issuer from its obligations under the Notes to the extent of such payment.
(c) Subject to clause (d) of this Condition 10
(i) the Issuer reserves the right to terminate the appointment of any Agent, as well 
as to appoint or, after any such appointment, to terminate the appointment of, 
one or more other paying agents to carry out any payment or other similar 
functions in respect of the Notes (each, a "Paying Agent"), provided that (A) so 
long as any Note is outstanding, there will at all times be a Fiscal Agent, a 
Registrar, a Calculation Agent and a Settlement Agent, (B) for so long as the 
Notes are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange and if then required by the 
regulations of the SIX Swiss Exchange, the Issuer shall maintain a Paying Agent 
in Switzerland, which agent shall have an office in Switzerland and be a bank or 
securities dealer subject to supervision by FINMA, to perform the functions of a 
Swiss paying agent (the "Swiss Paying Agent"), and (C) any successor 
Calculation Agent must be a leading bank or financial institution that is 
experienced in the calculations and determinations to be made by the Calculation 
Agent; and
(ii) if at any time the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar, the Calculation Agent, or the Swiss 
Paying Agent, (A) becomes incapable of acting, or (B) is adjudged bankrupt or 
insolvent, or files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or makes an assignment for 
the benefit of its creditors, or consents to the appointment of a receiver of all or 
any substantial part of its property, or admits in writing its inability to pay or meet 
its debts as they mature, or if an order of any court is entered approving any 
petition filed by or against it under the provisions of any applicable bankruptcy 
or insolvency law, or if a receiver of it or of all or any substantial part of its 
property is appointed, or if any public officer takes charge or control of it or of its
10279448089-v20 112 70-41069139
property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation 
(any such event, an "Agent Insolvency Event"), then the Issuer will terminate 
the appointment of such Agent in accordance with the Fiscal Agency Agreement 
and appoint a successor Agent; and
(iii) if at any time the Calculation Agent fails to (A) determine the Mid Market Swap 
Rate or the Reset Interest Rate or duly calculate the Reset Interest Amount for 
any Reset Interest Period or the interest amount payable on the Redemption Date 
(if the Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to Condition 6 (Redemption and 
Purchase)) or (B) comply with any other requirement in relation to the Notes, 
then the Issuer will terminate the appointment of the Calculation Agent in 
accordance with the Fiscal Agency Agreement and appoint a successor 
Calculation Agent; provided, however, that, if the Calculation Agent duly 
calculates such Reset Interest Rate, Reset Interest Amount or interest 
amount payable on the Redemption Date, as the case may be, prior to its 
termination (and the appointment of its successor) taking effect in 
accordance with clause (d) of this Condition 10, the Issuer may elect, in 
its sole discretion and upon notice to the Holders in accordance with 
Condition 15 (Notices), to cancel such termination (and appointment).
(d) Any appointment or termination of appointment of, or any resignation by, any Agent 
(other than the Settlement Agent) may only take effect not more than 45 and not less than 
30 days after the Issuer has notified the Holders of such appointment, termination or 
resignation in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices); provided, however, that, in the case 
of the termination of an Agent with respect to which an Agent Insolvency Event has 
occurred, such termination may take effect prior to the expiry of such 30-day notice period, 
so long as a successor Agent has been appointed to the extent required by the immediately 
succeeding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any termination of the appointment 
of, or resignation by, the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar, the Swiss Paying Agent or the 
Calculation Agent may not take effect until the Issuer has appointed a successor Fiscal 
Agent, Registrar, Swiss Paying Agent or Calculation Agent, as applicable; provided, 
however, that, if no such successor has been appointed within 30 days of the scheduled 
effectiveness of such termination or resignation, any Holder (on behalf of itself and all 
others similarly situated) or, pursuant to and in accordance with the Fiscal Agency 
Agreement, the Fiscal Agent, the Registrar, any Paying Agent or the Calculation Agent, 
as the case may be, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment 
of a successor, at the expense of the Issuer.
(e) Subject to subclause (c)(i) of this Condition 10, the Issuer may appoint or terminate the 
appointment of a Settlement Agent, and a Settlement Agent may resign, at any time. The 
Issuer will notify the Holders of any such appointment, termination or resignation in 
accordance with Condition 15 (Notices).
11. TAXATION
(a) All payments to be made by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Notes (including, 
for the avoidance of doubt, payments by a Paying Agent) shall be made without 
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, 
assessments or other government charges of any nature ("Taxes") imposed, levied, 
collected, withheld or assessed by or on behalf of any Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof or any authority of or in a Tax Jurisdiction or any political subdivision 
thereof having the power to impose, levy, collect, withhold or assess Taxes, unless 
withholding, deduction or accounting for such Taxes is required by law.
(b) In the event that any payment to be made by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the 
Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payments by a Paying Agent) is subject to 
any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes by requirement of law in a 
Tax Jurisdiction (as determined by the relevant tax authority of or in such Tax 
Jurisdiction), the Issuer shall pay such additional amounts as will result in the Holders 
receiving the amounts that they would have received in respect of the Notes if no such 
withholding or deduction had been required ("Additional Amounts").
10279448089-v20 113 70-41069139
(c) No Additional Amounts will be payable pursuant to clause (b) of this Condition 11 in 
relation to any Note:
(i) if the relevant Holder is liable for such Taxes on such Note as a result of having 
some connection with the relevant Tax Jurisdiction other than its mere ownership 
or possession of such Note or the receipt of principal or interest in respect thereof; 
or
(ii) if such Taxes are a result of such Note having been presented for payment (where 
presentment is required) more than 30 days after the Relevant Date, except to the 
extent that the Holder would have been entitled to receive the Additional Amounts 
if it had presented such Note for payment on the last day of the 30-day period; or
(iii) with respect to any Tax collected pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the 
US Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the "Code"), the regulations 
promulgated thereunder, or applicable inter-governmental agreements or 
agreements with the United States Internal Revenue Service entered into in 
connection with the implementation of such sections of the Code, or legislation 
enacted by a non-United States jurisdiction in connection with the implementation 
of such sections of the Code (FATCA); or
(iv) where such withholding or deduction is required to be made pursuant to laws 
enacted by Switzerland providing for the taxation of payments according to 
principles similar to those laid down in the draft legislation of the Swiss Federal 
Council of 3 April 2020, or otherwise changing the Swiss federal withholding tax 
system from an issuer-based system to a paying agent-based system pursuant to 
which a Person other than the issuer is required to withhold tax on any interest 
payments; or
(v) to the extent any combination of subclauses (i) through (iv) of this clause (c) 
applies.
(d) Any reference in these Terms and Conditions to amounts payable by the Issuer in respect 
of the Notes includes (i) any Additional Amount payable pursuant to this Condition 11 
and (ii) any sum payable pursuant to an obligation taken in addition to or in substitution 
for the obligation in this Condition 11.
12. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
In accordance with Swiss law, (a) claims for interest payments under the Notes will become timebarred after the five-year period and (b) claims for the repayment or redemption of Notes will 
become time-barred after the 10-year period, in each case, commencing on the date on which such 
payments, repayment or redemption become due and payable.
13. EVENTS OF DEFAULT
(a) If any of the following events occurs, such occurrence will constitute an "Event of 
Default":
(i) the Issuer fails to pay the principal amount of any Note if and when the same 
becomes due and payable under these Terms and Conditions, and such failure 
continues unremedied for a period of 30 days; or
(ii) the Issuer fails to pay any interest on the Notes if and when the same becomes 
due and payable under these Terms and Conditions, and such failure continues 
unremedied for a period of 30 days; or
(iii) the Issuer fails to observe or perform any other covenant, condition, or agreement 
contained in these Terms and Conditions, and such failure continues unremedied 
for a period of 60 days after written notice thereof from any Holder to the Issuer; 
or
10279448089-v20 114 70-41069139
(iv) a Bankruptcy Event;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding subclauses (i) to (iv) above, neither (A) the 
opening of Restructuring Proceedings with respect to the Issuer nor (B) the exercise of 
any Swiss Resolution Power with respect to the Issuer during any such Restructuring 
Proceedings nor (C) the ordering of any Protective Measures with respect to the Issuer that 
are ordered or confirmed upon the opening of or during any such Restructuring 
Proceedings will constitute a default or an Event of Default.
(b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to any failure of the Issuer to meet 
any payment obligation under these Terms and Conditions and subject to Condition 8 
(Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), (i) such payment obligation (and 
such payment obligation only) will be immediately deemed a due and payable (fällige) 
payment obligation of the Issuer, and (ii) if (A) the relevant Holder has formally 
requested payment of such payment obligation, (B) such payment obligation has 
not been fulfilled within the statutory period under Swiss law commencing after 
the date of such formal request and (C) a writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl) has 
been issued with respect to such payment obligation pursuant to the DEBA, the 
relevant Holder may institute proceedings against the Issuer in Switzerland (but 
not elsewhere) to enforce its rights with respect to such payment obligation 
under the DEBA.
(c) If a debt collection or insolvency proceeding with respect to the Issuer is instituted in 
Switzerland in accordance with clause (b) of this Condition 13, the Issuer shall not (i) after 
having received the writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl) relating to the relevant payment 
obligation, argue or plead that such payment obligation is not due and payable by the 
Issuer, or (ii) prior to the declaration of bankruptcy (or similar proceeding under Swiss 
insolvency laws), make any payment to the relevant Holder under or in connection with 
the Notes.
(d) In the case of any Event of Default arising under subclause (a)(iii) of this Condition 13 
and subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), any 
Holder may seek specific performance or damages with respect to such Event of Default 
pursuant to the Swiss Code if so entitled thereunder. Any such damage claim of any Holder 
will rank junior to the rights and claims of all holders of Senior Obligations.
(e) In the case of any Event of Default arising under subclause (a)(iv) of this Condition 13 
and subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), any 
Holder may, by written notice to the Issuer, declare the principal amount of any of its 
Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, immediately due and 
payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind.
(f) No remedy against the Issuer other than those described in this Condition 13 will be 
available to the Holders in connection with the Issuer's obligations under these Terms and 
Conditions, whether for the recovery of amounts owing under these Terms and Conditions 
or in respect of any breach by the Issuer of any of its other obligations under these Terms 
and Conditions or otherwise. In particular, no Holder may declare (i) the principal amount 
of any Notes due and payable prior to any Redemption Date, or (ii) any interest on any 
Notes due and payable prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, except, in the case of 
each of subclauses (i) and (ii) of this clause (f), pursuant to clause (e) of this Condition 13.
14. MEETINGS OF HOLDERS; SUBSTITUTION AND AMENDMENT
(a) Except as otherwise specified in this Condition 14, the provisions of bondholder meetings 
contained in article 1157 et seqq. of the Swiss Code apply in relation to meetings of 
Holders.
(b) If a Tax Event or a Regulatory Event has occurred, the Issuer may, without the consent of 
the Holders, either substitute all, but not some only, of the Notes for, or amend these Terms 
and Conditions so that they remain or become, Compliant Securities, provided that:
10279448089-v20 115 70-41069139
(i) neither a Tax Event nor a Regulatory Event arises as a result of such substitution 
or amendment;
(ii) FINMA has approved such substitution or amendment (if such approval is then 
required under applicable Swiss laws and regulations);
(iii) the Issuer has given the Holders not less than 30 days' notice of such substitution 
or amendment in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices), which notice will, 
subject to subclause (v) of this clause (b), be irrevocable, and state the date on 
which such substitution or amendment will be effective (the "Substitution or 
Amendment Effective Date");
(iv) prior to the publication of any notice pursuant to subclause (iii) of this clause (b), 
the Issuer shall deliver to the Fiscal Agent (A) a certificate signed by the 
Authorised Signatories stating that the relevant requirement or circumstance 
giving rise to the right to substitute or amend the terms of the Notes, as 
applicable, pursuant to this clause (b) is satisfied and the reasons therefor and 
such certificate will be conclusive and binding on the Holders, and (B) an 
opinion of independent legal advisers of recognised standing to the effect that 
circumstances entitling the Issuer to exercise its right to substitute or amend the 
terms of the Notes, as applicable, pursuant to this clause (b) have arisen; and
(v) no Trigger Event or Viability Event has occurred prior to the relevant Substitution 
or Amendment Effective Date.
In connection with any substitution or amendment in accordance with this clause (b), the 
Issuer shall comply with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Notes are for the 
time being listed or admitted to trading.
(c) In addition to its rights under clause (b) of this Condition 14, the Issuer may, without the 
consent of the Holders, make any amendment to these Terms and Conditions that it 
considers to be (i) necessary or desirable to give effect to (A) any Alternative 
Benchmark Rate determined in accordance with clause (c) of Condition 5 (Interest) 
(including any Adjustment Spread determined in accordance with subclause (v)(A)(2) 
thereof and any alternative method for determining the Mid Market Swap Rate if such 
Alternative Benchmark Rate is unavailable on the relevant Reset Determination Date 
determined in accordance with subclause (v)(A)(3) thereof), and any related changes to 
the definitions of the terms "Business Day", "Day Count Fraction", "Payment Business 
Day" and/or "Reset Determination Date" determined to be necessary in accordance with 
subclause (v)(D) thereof, or (B) the provisions of clause (a) of Condition 16 (Issuer 
Substitution) (including, without limitation, (x) if the Substitute Issuer is organised 
and/or resident for tax purposes in a jurisdiction other than Switzerland, any amendments 
to any references to the jurisdiction of "Switzerland" contained herein, including, 
without limitation, amendments to the definition of the term "Bankruptcy Event", the 
definition of the term "Business Day", the governing law of the subordination provisions 
set forth in Condition 4 (Status and Subordination) and the provisions of Condition 13 
(Events of Default), and (y) any amendments to reflect UBS Group AG's guarantee 
described in subclause (a)(iii) of Condition 16 (Issuer Substitution)), or (C) the 
provisions of subclause (e)(iii) and/or subclause (e)(i)(B) of Condition 9 (Conversion), 
or (ii) formal, minor or technical in nature, or (iii) necessary to correct a manifest error, 
or (iv) not materially prejudicial to the interests of the Holders.
(d) The Issuer shall notify the Holders of any amendments made pursuant to clause (c) of this 
Condition 14 in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices), which notice shall state the date 
on which such amendment will be effective.
(e) Any amendment made pursuant to this Condition 14 will be binding on the Holders in 
accordance with its terms.
10279448089-v20 116 70-41069139
15. NOTICES
(a) So long as the Notes are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, notices to Holders shall be 
given by the Issuer (i) by means of electronic publication on the internet website of SIX 
Exchange Regulation Ltd (https://www.ser-ag.com), where notices are as at the Issue Date 
published under the address https://www.ser-ag.com/en/resources/notifications-marketparticipants/official-notices.html#/, or (ii) otherwise in accordance with the regulations of 
the SIX Swiss Exchange. Any notice will be validly given on the date of such publication 
or, if published more than once, on the date of the first such publication.
(b) If the Notes are for any reason no longer listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange:
(i) if the Notes are represented by one or more Global Certificates deposited with a 
custodian for DTC, notices to Holders shall only be required to be given by the 
Issuer in accordance with clause (c) of this Condition 15; or
(ii) if the Global Certificate(s) have been exchanged for Definitive Certificates, the 
Issuer shall send notices to Holders by first class mail at their respective addresses 
as recorded in the Register, and any such notice will be validly given on the fourth 
Business Day after the date of such mailing.
(c) So long as the Notes are represented by one or more Global Certificates deposited with a 
custodian for DTC, any notices required to be given by the Issuer to the Holders hereunder 
shall also be given to the Indirect Holders through the Fiscal Agent to DTC for forwarding 
to the Indirect Holders. Any such notice will be validly given on the date of delivery to 
DTC in accordance with DTC's applicable procedures.
16. ISSUER SUBSTITUTION
(a) The Issuer (for purposes of this Condition 16, the "Current Issuer") may, without the 
consent of the Holders, substitute any entity (whether or not such entity is organised under 
the laws of Switzerland) (such substitute entity, the "Substitute Issuer") for itself as 
principal debtor under the Notes upon giving no more than 30 and no less than 10 days' 
notice to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices), provided that:
(i) the Substitute Issuer is UBS Group AG or, if the Substitute Issuer is not UBS 
Group AG, (A) an exemption exists from the requirement to register the 
Substitute Issuer as an investment company under the US Investment Company 
Act, and (B) at least 95 per cent. of the Substitute Issuer's capital and voting rights 
are held, directly or indirectly, by UBS Group AG;
(ii) the Current Issuer is not in default in respect of any amount payable under the 
Notes at the time of such substitution;
(iii) if the Substitute Issuer is not UBS Group AG, UBS Group AG has irrevocably 
and unconditionally guaranteed to the Holders, pursuant to article 111 of the 
Swiss Code and on a subordinated basis corresponding mutatis mutandis to 
Condition 4 (Status and Subordination), (A) the due and punctual payment of 
principal and interest and all other amounts due and payable by the Substitute 
Issuer under, or in respect of, the Notes upon receipt of the written request for 
payment of the relevant amount, and (B) upon the occurrence of a Conversion, 
the due delivery of the Ordinary Shares required to be delivered pursuant to 
Condition 9 (Conversion), and on the terms whereby subclause (iii) of Condition 
5(i) (Cancellation of interest; prohibited interest), subclause (d)(ii)(C) of 
Condition 9 (Conversion), Condition 11 (Taxation), Condition 13 (Events of 
Default) and Condition 21 (No Set-off by Holders) apply to UBS Group AG and

17. CONSOLIDATION, MERGER OR SALE
The Issuer will not consolidate with, merge with or into, or sell, convey, transfer or otherwise 
dispose of all or substantially all of its property and assets (as an entirety or substantially as an

10279448089-v20 118 70-41069139

18. FURTHER ISSUES
The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Holders issue further notes and, 
provided that such notes have the same terms and conditions as the Notes in all respects (or in all 
respects except for the issue date and/or first date on which interest is paid), such further notes will 
be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes. If the Issuer issues any such further notes 
pursuant to this Condition 18, references in these Terms and Conditions to "Notes" include such 
further notes, unless the context otherwise requires.
19. CURRENCY INDEMNITY

winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise) under the Notes will only constitute a 
discharge of the Issuer to the extent of the amount in USD that such Holder is able to purchase 
with the amount so received or recovered in such other currency on the date of such receipt or 
recovery (or, if it is not practicable to purchase USD with such amount on such date, on the first 
date on which it is practicable to do so). If the amount of USD that such Holder is able to purchase 
is less than the amount owed by the Issuer to such Holder under the Notes, the Issuer shall 
indemnify such Holder against any loss sustained by it as a result. In addition, the Issuer shall 
indemnify such Holder for the costs of making such purchase. For purposes of this Condition 19, 
it is sufficient for the relevant Holder to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an 
actual purchase been made. The indemnities under this Condition 19 will (a) constitute a separate 
and independent obligation from the Issuer's other obligations hereunder, (b) give rise to a separate

Securities Act in relation to the Notes.
21. NO SET-OFF BY HOLDERS
Subject to applicable law, each Holder and Indirect Holder, by acceptance of any direct or 
beneficial interest in a Note, agrees that it will not, and waives its right to, exercise, claim or plead 
any right of set-off, compensation or retention with respect to any amount owed to it by the Issuer 
in respect of, or arising in connection with, the Notes.

Notes are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Switzerland.
(b) The courts of the Canton of Zurich (venue being the City of Zurich) shall have exclusive 
jurisdiction to settle any disputes that may arise out of or in connection with the Notes, 
including any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with the Notes.

amount of any Higher-Trigger Contingent Capital that is not denominated in the Presentation

FISA ("Intermediated Securities").
So long as the Notes are Intermediated Securities, the Notes may only be transferred by 
the entry of the transferred Notes in a securities account of the transferee, as set out in the 
provisions of the FISA.
The records of the Intermediary will determine the number of Notes held through each 
participant in the Intermediary.
10280098139-v7 74 70-41069801
Neither the Issuer nor any Holder nor any other Person will at any time have the right to 
effect or demand the conversion of the Notes into, or the delivery of, a global note 
(Globalurkunde) or individually certificated securities (Wertpapiere).
3. RESERVED
4. STATUS AND SUBORDINATION
(a) Status
The Notes constitute direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of the Issuer and rank 
pari passu and without any preference among themselves. The rights and claims of the 
Holders against the Issuer under the Notes are subordinated as described in clause (b) of 
this Condition 4.
(b) Subordination
In the event of (i) a Bankruptcy Event or (ii) an order being made, or an effective 
resolution being passed, for the liquidation or winding-up of the Issuer (except, in any such 
case, a solvent liquidation or winding-up of the Issuer solely for purposes of a 
reorganisation, reconstruction or amalgamation of the Issuer or the substitution in place of 
the Issuer of a successor in business to the Issuer, the terms of which reorganisation, 
reconstruction, amalgamation or substitution (x) have previously been approved by a valid 
resolution of the Holders and (y) do not provide that the Notes shall become redeemable in 
accordance with these Terms and Conditions),
(i) if such event occurs (x) prior to the occurrence of a Conversion Capital 
Availability Event, or (y) on or after the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event but prior to the occurrence of a Conversion 
Event, the rights and claims of the Holders against the Issuer in respect 
of or arising under (including, without limitation, any damages awarded 
for breach of any obligation under) the Notes will, subject to any 
obligations that are mandatorily preferred by law, rank (A) junior to the 
rights and claims of all holders of Senior Obligations,
(B) pari passu with the rights and claims of holders of Parity 
Obligations, and
(C) senior to the rights and claims of holders of Junior Obligations; 
provided, however, that, if a Conversion Event subsequently occurs while 
such Bankruptcy Event or liquidation or winding-up, as the case may be, 
is continuing, the rights and claims of the Holders against the Issuer in 
respect of the delivery of Ordinary Shares in accordance with Condition 
9 (Conversion) will rank as set forth in subclause (ii) below; or
(ii) if such event occurs on or after the occurrence of a Conversion Event, 
the rights and claims of the Holders against the Issuer in respect of the 
delivery of Ordinary Shares in accordance with Condition 9 
(Conversion) will rank (A) junior to the rights and claims of all holders 
of Senior Obligations, (B) junior to the rights and claims of holders of 
Parity Obligations, and (C) pari passu with the rights and claims of 
holders of Junior Obligations.
(c) Claims subject to a Contingent Write-down or a Conversion
Any claim of any Holder in respect of or arising under the Notes (including, without 
limitation, any claim in relation to any unsatisfied payment obligation of the Issuer 
subject to enforcement by any Holder pursuant to Condition 13 (Events of Default) or in 
relation to the occurrence of any other Event of Default) will be subject to, and 
superseded by, Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), as 
applicable, irrespective of whether the relevant Trigger Event or Viability Event, as 
applicable, has occurred, or, in the case of a Viability Event, the relevant Viability Event 
Notice has been given, prior to or after the occurrence of an Event of Default or any 
other event.
10280098139-v7 75 70-41069801
5. INTEREST
(a) Interest Payment Dates
(i) Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) 
and clause (h) of this Condition 5, the Notes will bear interest on their principal 
amount (A) from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the First Call 
Date, at the Fixed Interest Rate, and (B) thereafter, at the applicable Reset 
Interest Rate.
(ii) Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) 
and clause (i) of this Condition 5, interest on the Notes will be payable semiannually in arrear on 21 February and 21 August of each year (each, an 
"Interest Payment Date"), commencing on 21 August 2024.
(b) Determination of the Reference Rate, the Reset Interest Rate and the Reset Interest 
Amount in relation to each Reset Interest Period
With respect to each Reset Interest Period and subject to clause (c) of this Condition 5, 
the Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after the Relevant Time on the Reset 
Determination Date in relation to such Reset Interest Period, determine the Reference 
Rate and the Reset Interest Rate for such Reset Interest Period and calculate the amount 
of interest payable per Calculation Amount on the Interest Payment Date in relation to 
each Interest Period falling in such Reset Interest Period (each, a "Reset Interest 
Amount").
(c) Benchmark replacement
If the Issuer (in consultation with the Calculation Agent) determines prior to any Reset 
Determination Date that (x) the rate referred to in clause (a) of the definition of the term 
"Reference Rate" (the "Existing Benchmark Rate") has been discontinued or (y) there 
has been a public statement or publication of information by the administrator of the 
Existing Benchmark Rate (or any component thereof) or the regulatory supervisor for the 
administrator of the Existing Benchmark Rate (or any component thereof) announcing that 
the Existing Benchmark Rate (or such component) is no longer representative, then the 
following provisions shall apply (subject to the subsequent operation of this clause (c)):
(i) the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint an Independent Adviser to 
determine in the Independent Adviser's discretion, in accordance with subclause 
(iv) below, an alternative rate to the Existing Benchmark Rate (the "Alternative 
Benchmark Rate") no later than three Business Days prior to the Reset 
Determination Date relating to the next succeeding Reset Interest Period (such 
Business Day, the "Independent Adviser Determination Cut-off Date", and 
such next succeeding Reset Interest Period, the "Affected Reset Interest 
Period") for purposes of determining the Reference Rate in respect of the 
Affected Reset Interest Period and all Reset Interest Periods thereafter;
(ii) if prior to the Independent Adviser Determination Cut-off Date the Issuer is 
unable to appoint an Independent Adviser or the Independent Adviser appointed 
by the Issuer fails to determine an Alternative Benchmark Rate in accordance 
with subclause (iv) below, then the Issuer (in consultation with the Calculation 
Agent) may determine in its discretion, in accordance with subclause (iv) below, 
the Alternative Benchmark Rate for purposes of determining the Reference Rate 
in respect of the Affected Reset Interest Period and all Reset Interest Periods 
thereafter;
(iii) if subclause (ii) above applies and the Issuer is unable or unwilling to determine 
the Alternative Benchmark Rate prior to the Reset Determination Date relating 
to the Affected Reset Interest Period in accordance with subclause (iv) below, 
the Reference Rate in respect of the Affected Reset Interest Period will be equal 
to the Reference Rate in respect of the immediately preceding Reset Interest 
Period (or, if there is no preceding Reset Interest Period, the Reset Interest Rate
10280098139-v7 76 70-41069801
applicable to the Affected Reset Interest Period will be equal to the Fixed Interest 
Rate); provided, however, that, if this subclause (iii) applies to the Affected Reset 
Interest Period, the Reset Interest Rate for all succeeding Reset Interest Periods 
will be the Reset Interest Rate applicable to the Affected Reset Interest Period as 
determined in accordance with this subclause (iii) unless (A) the Issuer, in its sole 
discretion, elects to determine an Alternative Benchmark Rate in respect of any 
such succeeding Reset Interest Period and all Reset Interest Periods thereafter in 
accordance with the processes set out in this clause (c), and (B) an Alternative 
Benchmark Rate is so determined;
(iv) in the case of any determination of an Alternative Benchmark Rate pursuant to 
subclause (i) or (ii) above, such Alternative Benchmark Rate will be such rate as 
the Independent Adviser or the Issuer (in consultation with the Calculation 
Agent), as applicable, determines in its reasonable discretion has replaced the 
Existing Benchmark Rate in customary market usage, or, if the Independent 
Adviser or the Issuer, as applicable, determines in its reasonable discretion that 
there is no such rate, such other rate as the Independent Adviser or the Issuer (in 
consultation with the Calculation Agent) determines in its reasonable discretion 
is most comparable to the Existing Benchmark Rate; and
(v) if the Independent Adviser or the Issuer determines an Alternative Benchmark 
Rate in accordance with the above provisions of this clause (c),
(A) the Independent Adviser (in the case of subclause (2) below, in 
consultation with the Issuer) or, following consultation with the 
Calculation Agent, the Issuer (as the case may be) shall also determine 
in its reasonable discretion (1) the method for obtaining such 
Alternative Benchmark Rate, including the page on or source from 
which such Alternative Benchmark Rate appears or is obtained (the 
"Alternative Reference Rate Page"), and the time at which such 
Alternative Benchmark Rate appears on, or is obtained from, the 
Alternative Reference Rate Page (the "Alternative Relevant Time"), 
(2) whether to apply an Adjustment Spread to such Alternative 
Benchmark Rate and, if so, the Adjustment Spread, which Adjustment 
Spread must be recognised or acknowledged as being in customary 
market usage in international debt capital markets transactions that 
reference the Existing Benchmark Rate, where such rate has been 
replaced by such Alternative Benchmark Rate, and (3) any alternative 
method for determining the Reference Rate if such Alternative 
Benchmark Rate is unavailable on the relevant Reset Determination 
Date, which alternative method shall be consistent with any Alternative 
Benchmark Rate that has broad market support;
(B) for the Affected Reset Interest Period and all Reset Interest Periods 
thereafter, (1) clause (a) of the definition of the term "Reference Rate" 
shall be amended pursuant to clause (c) of Condition 14 (Meetings of 
Holders; Substitution and Amendment) to give effect to the 
determination described in subclause (A)(1) above and any Adjustment 
Spread determined pursuant to subclause (A)(2) above, and (2) clause 
(b) of the definition of the term "Reference Rate " shall be amended 
pursuant to clause (c) of Condition 14 (Meetings of Holders; 
Substitution and Amendment) to give effect to the determination 
described in subclause (A)(3) above;
(C) references to the Reference Rate Page and the Relevant Time in these 
Terms and Conditions will be deemed to be references to the 
Alternative Reference Rate Page and the Alternative Relevant Time, 
respectively;
(D) if any changes to the definitions of the terms "Business Day", "Day 
Count Fraction", "Payment Business Day" and/or "Reset Determination 
Date" are necessary in order to implement the amendments described in 
subclause (B) above, such definitions shall be amended pursuant to
10280098139-v7 77 70-41069801
clause (c) of Condition 14 (Meetings of Holders; Substitution and 
Amendment) to reflect such changes; and
(E) the Issuer shall promptly give notice to the Holders in accordance with 
Condition 15 (Notices) specifying such Alternative Benchmark Rate 
(including any Adjustment Spread determined pursuant to subclause 
(A)(2) above and any alternative method for determining the Reference 
Rate described in subclause (A)(3) above), the Alternative Reference 
Rate Page, the Alternative Relevant Time, and any amendments 
implemented pursuant to clause (c) of Condition 14 (Meetings of 
Holders; Substitution and Amendment) as described in subclauses (B) 
and (D) above.
Any determination that is made by an Independent Adviser or by the Issuer for purposes of this 
clause (c) will be made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
(d) Publication of Reset Interest Rate and interest amount payable upon redemption
With respect to each Reset Interest Period, as soon as practicable after such determination 
but in any event no later than the relevant Reset Date, the Calculation Agent will cause
(i) the relevant Reset Interest Rate and the relevant Reset Interest Amount determined by 
it, together with the Interest Payment Date in relation to each Interest Period falling in 
such Reset Interest Period, to be notified to the Issuer and the Paying Agents and (ii) the 
relevant Reset Interest Rate determined by it to be notified to any stock exchange or other 
relevant authority on which the Notes are at the relevant time listed and to be published in 
accordance with Condition 15 (Notices).
The Calculation Agent shall calculate any interest amount payable on any Redemption 
Date (if the Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to Condition 6 (Redemption and 
Purchase)) and cause such interest amount to be notified to Issuer and the Paying Agents 
and to any stock exchange or other relevant authority on which the Notes are at the 
relevant time listed and to be published in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) no 
later than two Business Days prior to such Redemption Date.
(e) Calculation of amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount
Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) and clause 
(i) of this Condition 5:
(i) the amount of interest payable per Calculation Amount on each Interest 
Payment Date falling on or before the First Call Date will be calculated by:
(A) applying the Fixed Interest Rate to the Calculation Amount;
(B) multiplying the product thereof by the Day Count Fraction; and
(C) rounding the resulting figure to the nearest cent (half a cent being 
rounded upwards); and
(ii) if interest is required to be paid in respect of a Note on any other date (including, 
for the avoidance of doubt, the Reset Interest Amount), the amount of interest 
payable per Calculation Amount on such date will be calculated by:
(A) applying the applicable Interest Rate to the Calculation Amount;
(B) multiplying the product thereof by the Day Count Fraction; and
(C) rounding the resulting figure to the nearest cent (half a cent being 
rounded upwards).
10280098139-v7 78 70-41069801
(f) Calculation of amount of interest payable per Note
Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion) and 
clause (i) of this Condition 5, the amount of interest payable in respect of a Note will be 
the product of:
(i) the amount of interest per Calculation Amount; and
(ii) the number by which the Calculation Amount is required to be multiplied to equal 
the denomination of such Note.
(g) Notifications, etc. to be final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and 
decisions given, expressed, made or obtained for purposes of this Condition 5, whether 
by the Reset Reference Banks (or any of them) or the Calculation Agent or the 
Independent Adviser, will (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith and manifest error) 
be binding on the Issuer, the Agents and the Holders and (in the absence of wilful default 
and bad faith) no liability to the Issuer or the Holders will attach to the Reset Reference 
Banks (or any of them), the Calculation Agent or the Independent Adviser in connection 
with the exercise or non-exercise by the Calculation Agent or the Independent Adviser of 
its powers, duties and discretions under this Condition 5.
(h) Accrual of interest in the case of redemption or a Trigger Event or a Viability Event
(i) Subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), 
if the Notes are to be redeemed pursuant to clause (b), (c) or (d) of Condition 6 
(Redemption and Purchase), interest on the Notes will accrue to (but excluding) 
the relevant Redemption Date, and will cease to accrue on such Redemption 
Date; provided, however, that if the payment with respect to any Note is 
improperly withheld or refused on such Redemption Date, interest will continue 
to accrue on the principal amount of such Note (both before and after judgment) 
at the relevant Interest Rate to the Relevant Date.
(ii) Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event or a Viability Event, interest on the 
Notes will cease to accrue from (and including) the date on which such Trigger 
Event or Viability Event occurs.
(i) Cancellation of interest; prohibited interest
(j) The Issuer may, in its sole discretion, elect to cancel all or part of any payment 
of interest on the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any related 
Additional Amounts) that is otherwise scheduled to be paid on an Interest 
Payment Date. This subclause (i)(i) is without prejudice to the provisions of 
subclause (i)(ii) of this Condition 5. Non-payment of any amount of interest by 
the Issuer to the Principal Paying Agent will constitute evidence of cancellation 
of the relevant payment, whether or not notice of cancellation has been given by 
the Issuer.
If practicable, the Issuer shall provide notice of any cancellation of interest (in 
whole or in part) pursuant to this subclause (i)(i) to the Holders on or prior to the 
relevant Interest Payment Date. If practicable, the Issuer shall endeavour to 
provide such notice at least five Business Days prior to the relevant Interest 
Payment Date. Failure to provide such notice will not have any impact on the 
effectiveness of, or otherwise invalidate, any such cancellation of interest, or 
give Holders any rights as a result of such failure.
(ii) The Issuer will be prohibited from making, in whole or in part, any payment of 
interest on the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any related
10280098139-v7 79 70-41069801
Additional Amounts) on the relevant Interest Payment Date if and to the extent 
that:
(A) the amount of Distributable Items as at such Interest Payment Date is 
less than the sum of (1) the amount of such interest payment, plus (2) 
all other payments (other than redemption payments) made by UBS 
Group AG on or in respect of the Notes or any Parity Obligations or 
Junior Obligations since the balance sheet date of the Relevant 
Accounts and prior to such Interest Payment Date, plus (3) all payments 
(other than redemption payments) payable by UBS Group AG on such 
Interest Payment Date on or in respect of any Parity Obligations or 
Junior Obligations, in the case of each of subclauses (1), (2) and (3), 
excluding any portion of such payments already accounted for in 
determining the amount of such Distributable Items; and/or
(B) UBS Group AG is not, or will not immediately after the relevant 
payment of interest be, in compliance with all applicable minimum 
capital adequacy requirements of the National Regulations on a 
consolidated (Finanzgruppe) basis (for the avoidance of doubt, it being 
understood that such minimum requirements will reflect any reduction 
in such requirements granted by FINMA to the Group pursuant to the 
Capital Adequacy Ordinance); and/or
(C) FINMA has required the Issuer not to make such interest payment.
The Issuer shall deliver a certificate signed by the Authorised Signatories to the 
Principal Paying Agent and shall give notice in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices) to the Holders, in each case as soon as practicable following any 
determination that interest is required to be cancelled pursuant to this subclause 
(i)(ii) or, where no such prior determination is made, promptly following any 
Interest Payment Date on which interest was scheduled to be paid if such 
interest is being cancelled in accordance with this subclause (i)(ii), to such effect 
setting out brief details as to the amount of interest being cancelled and the 
reason therefor. Failure to provide such certificate and notice will not have any 
impact on the effectiveness of, or otherwise invalidate, any such cancellation or 
give any Holder any rights as a result of such failure.
(iii) If, on any Interest Payment Date, any payment of interest scheduled to be made 
on such date is not made in full pursuant to subclause (i)(i) or subclause (i)(ii) of 
this Condition 5, UBS Group AG shall not, directly or indirectly,
(A) recommend to Shareholders that any dividend or other distribution in 
cash or in kind (other than in the form of Ordinary Shares) be paid or 
made on any Ordinary Shares; or
(B) redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any Ordinary Shares other than as 
a Permitted Transaction,
in each case unless and until (x) the interest payment due and payable on the 
Notes on any subsequent Interest Payment Date has been paid in full (or an 
amount equal to the same has been paid in full to a designated third party trust 
account for the benefit of the Holders prior to payment by the trustee thereof to 
the Holders on such subsequent Interest Payment Date) or, if earlier, (y) all 
outstanding Notes have been cancelled in accordance with these Terms and 
Conditions.
(iv) Payments of interest on the Notes are not cumulative. Notwithstanding any other 
provision in these Terms and Conditions, the cancellation or non-payment of 
any interest amount by virtue of this Condition 5(i) will not constitute a default 
for any purpose (including, without limitation, Condition 13 (Events of Default)) 
on the part of the Issuer. Any interest payment not paid by virtue of this
10280098139-v7 80 70-41069801
Condition 5(i) will not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter, and 
Holders will have no right thereto.
(v) If UBS Group AG determines, after consultation with FINMA, that the Notes do 
not, or will cease to, fully qualify as Additional Tier 1 Capital, (A) the Issuer 
shall not, to the extent permitted under National Regulations, exercise its 
discretion pursuant to subclause (i)(i) of this Condition 5 to cancel any interest 
payments due on the Notes on any Interest Payment Date following the 
occurrence of such determination, and (B) the Issuer shall give notice to the 
Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) as soon as practicable after 
such determination stating that the Issuer may no longer exercise its discretion 
pursuant to subclause (i)(i) of this Condition 5 to cancel any interest payments 
as from the date of such notice.
6. REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE
(a) No fixed redemption date
The Notes are perpetual securities in respect of which there is no fixed redemption date. 
Unless previously redeemed (including by way of Conversion pursuant to Condition 9 
(Conversion)) or purchased and cancelled in accordance with this Condition 6 and 
subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), the Notes 
are perpetual and may only be redeemed or purchased in accordance with this Condition 
6.
(b) Redemption at the option of the Issuer
Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 6, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to 
redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, on the First Call Date or any Interest 
Payment Date thereafter at their aggregate principal amount, together with any accrued 
and unpaid interest thereon to (but excluding) the relevant Redemption Date.
(c) Redemption due to a Tax Event
(i) Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 6, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event at 
any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to 
redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, on the relevant Redemption Date at 
their aggregate principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest 
thereon to (but excluding) such Redemption Date.
(ii) A "Tax Event" will have occurred if the Issuer in making any payments on the 
Notes (A) has paid, or will or would on the next payment date be required to 
pay, Additional Amounts, or (B) has paid, or will or would be required to pay, 
any additional Tax in respect of the Notes, in the case of each of subclauses (A) 
and (B), under the laws or regulations of a Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof or any authority of or in a Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof having the power to impose, levy, collect, withhold or assess 
Taxes, including, without limitation, any treaty to which a Tax Jurisdiction is a 
party, or any generally published application or interpretation of such laws 
(including, without limitation, a decision of any court or tribunal, any generally 
published application or interpretation of such laws by any relevant tax authority 
or any generally published pronouncement by any relevant tax authority), and 
the Issuer cannot avoid the foregoing by taking measures reasonably available to 
it.
(d) Redemption due to a Regulatory Event
(i) Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 6, upon the occurrence of a Regulatory 
Event at any time after the Issue Date, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, 
to redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, on the relevant Redemption Date at 
their aggregate principal amount, together with any accrued and unpaid interest 
thereon to (but excluding) such Redemption Date.
10280098139-v7 81 70-41069801
(ii) A "Regulatory Event" will have occurred if any of the Notes ceases to be eligible 
in full to be (A) treated as Additional Tier 1 Capital, and/or (B) counted towards 
either the Going-Concern LR Requirement or the Going-Concern RWA 
Requirement (or both).
(e) Conditions for redemption
(i) If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes pursuant to clause (b), (c) or (d) of this 
Condition 6, then the Issuer shall give the Holders not less than 15 and not more 
than 60 days' prior notice in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) (a 
"Redemption Notice"), which notice shall, subject to subclauses (ii) and (iii) of 
this clause (e), be irrevocable and specify (x) the clause of this Condition 6 
pursuant to which the redemption is to be made, and (y) the date (which date, in 
the case of a redemption pursuant to clause (c) or (d) of this Condition 6, shall be 
a Payment Business Day) on which the Issuer will redeem the Notes pursuant to 
such clause of this Condition 6 (such specified date, the "Redemption Date").
(ii) The Issuer may only redeem the Notes pursuant to clause (b) or (c) of this 
Condition 6 on the relevant Redemption Date if FINMA has approved such 
redemption on or prior to such Redemption Date, if such approval is then required 
under applicable Swiss laws and regulations.
(iii) The Issuer may only redeem the Notes pursuant to any clause of this Condition 6 
on the relevant Redemption Date if no Trigger Event or Viability Event has 
occurred prior to such Redemption Date.
(iv) If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes pursuant to clause (c) or (d) of this 
Condition 6, then prior to the publication of the Redemption Notice pursuant to 
subclause (e)(i) of this Condition 6, the Issuer shall deliver to the Principal 
Paying Agent (A) a certificate signed by the Authorised Signatories stating that 
the relevant requirement or circumstance giving rise to the right to redeem under 
clause (c) or (d), as applicable, of this Condition 6 is satisfied and the reasons 
therefor and such certificate will be conclusive and binding on the Holders, and 
(B) in the case of a redemption pursuant to clause (c) of this Condition 6 only, an 
opinion of independent legal advisers of recognised standing to the effect that 
circumstances entitling the Issuer to exercise its right of redemption under clause 
(c) of this Condition 6 have arisen.
(f) Purchases
The Issuer or any other member of the Group or any of their respective affiliates may at 
any time purchase Notes at any price in the open market or otherwise, provided that 
(i) such purchase complies with any limits or conditions to which any member of the 
Group is subject under applicable banking laws and regulations at the time of such 
purchase, (ii) other than in the case of purchases made in connection with stabilisation 
measures in compliance with applicable law or in connection with any market making in 
the Notes, FINMA has approved such purchase (if such approval is then required under 
applicable Swiss laws and regulations) on or prior to the date of such purchase, and (iii) no 
Trigger Event or Viability Event has occurred prior to the date of such purchase. Any 
Notes so purchased may, at the option of the Issuer, be held, reissued, resold or cancelled.
(g) Cancellation
All Notes redeemed in accordance with this Condition 6 or by way of Conversion 
pursuant to Condition 9 (Conversion) will be cancelled and may not be reissued or 
resold; provided, however, that, in the case of Notes redeemed by way of Conversion, 
the Issuer will not take any action to cause such Notes to be removed from the main 
register (Hauptregister) of the Intermediary prior to the later of (i) the Conversion Date 
and (ii) the date on which the relevant Ordinary Shares and/or cash proceeds to be 
delivered by the Settlement Share Depository or the Settlement Shares Offer Agent, as 
the case may be, to the relevant Holders pursuant to Condition 9 (Conversion) have been 
delivered.
10280098139-v7 82 70-41069801
(h) Redemption of other instruments
For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that, if, upon the occurrence of a Tax Event 
or a Regulatory Event, the Issuer does not elect to redeem the Notes pursuant to this 
Condition 6, nothing in this Condition 6 or any other provision of these Terms and 
Conditions will prohibit the Issuer from redeeming (whether early, at maturity or 
otherwise) any other instruments issued by any member of the Group pursuant to the 
terms thereof.
7. TRIGGER EVENT AND VIABILITY EVENT
(a) Trigger Event
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Trigger Event:
(A) if such Trigger Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Contingent Write-down will occur on the 
applicable Trigger Event Write-down Date in accordance with Condition 
8 (Contingent Write-down); or
(B) if such Trigger Event occurs on or after the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Conversion will occur on the applicable 
Trigger Event Conversion Date in accordance with Condition 9 
(Conversion).
(ii) A "Trigger Event" will have occurred if the Issuer gives the Holders a Trigger 
Event Notice in accordance with clause (b) of this Condition 7.
(b) Trigger Event Notice
(i) If, with respect to any Publication Date, the Trigger CET1 Ratio as of such 
Publication Date is less than the Threshold Ratio, the Issuer shall, subject to 
subclauses (ii) and (iii) of this Condition 7(b), give a notice (a "Trigger Event 
Notice") to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) (x) if such 
Publication Date is an Ordinary Publication Date, within five Business Days of 
such Ordinary Publication Date (such fifth Business Day, the "Trigger Breach 
Determination Date", and the date of such notice, the "Ordinary Trigger 
Event Notice Date"), and (y) if such Publication Date is an Extraordinary 
Publication Date, on such Extraordinary Publication Date (the "Extraordinary 
Trigger Event Notice Date"), which notice shall:
(A) if such Trigger Event Notice is given prior to the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event (1) state that the Trigger CET1 
Ratio as of such Publication Date is less than the Threshold Ratio, and a 
Contingent Write-down will take place, and (2) specify the date on 
which the Contingent Write-down will take place, which date shall, 
subject to postponement pursuant to subclause (ii) of this Condition 
7(b), be no later than 10 Business Days after the date of such notice (the 
"Trigger Event Write-down Date"); or
(B) if such Trigger Event Notice is given on or after the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, (1) state that the Trigger CET1 
Ratio as of such Publication Date is less than the Threshold Ratio, and a 
Conversion will take place, (2) specify the date on which the 
Conversion will take place, which date shall, subject to postponement 
pursuant to subclause (ii) of this Condition 7(b), be no more than 20 
Business Days after the date of such notice (the "Trigger Event 
Conversion Date"), (3) specify the Conversion Price in effect on the 
date of such Trigger Event Notice, and (4) specify the details of the 
arrangement for the settlement of the Conversion (including whether or 
not the Issuer will appoint a Settlement Shares Offer Agent to conduct a
10280098139-v7 83 70-41069801
Settlement Shares Offer and, if the Settlement Share Depository is not 
SIX SIS, the details of the Settlement Share Depository).
(ii) If a Trigger Event Notice is required to be given pursuant to subclause (i) of this 
Condition 7(b), and on the relevant Publication Date any Higher-Trigger 
Contingent Capital is outstanding with respect to which either (x) no HigherTrigger Write-down/Conversion Notice has been given prior to the Trigger 
Event Notice Date or (y) a Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion Notice has 
been given prior to the Trigger Event Notice Date, but the Trigger Event Writedown Date or the Trigger Event Conversion Date, as applicable, is scheduled to 
occur prior to the relevant Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion Date,
(A) in the case of subclause (x) above, the giving of such Trigger Event 
Notice will be postponed until the date on which a Higher-Trigger Writedown/Conversion Notice has been given with respect to all such 
outstanding Higher-Trigger Contingent Capital and such date will be 
deemed to be the Trigger Event Notice Date; and
(B) in the case of subclauses (x) and (y) above, if the Trigger Event Writedown Date or the Trigger Event Conversion Date, as applicable, is 
scheduled to occur prior to the Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion 
Date (or, in the case of more than one Higher-Trigger Writedown/Conversion Date, the latest Higher-Trigger Writedown/Conversion Date), the Trigger Event Write-down Date or the 
Trigger Event Conversion Date, as applicable, will be postponed to the 
Higher-Trigger Write-down/Conversion Date (or the latest HigherTrigger Write-down/Conversion Date, as applicable) and such 
postponement shall be specified in such Trigger Event Notice.
(iii) If (A) a Trigger Event Notice is required to be given pursuant to subclause (i) of 
this Condition 7(b) in relation to an Ordinary Publication Date, and (B) prior to 
the earlier of the Ordinary Trigger Event Notice Date and the Trigger Breach 
Determination Date, FINMA, upon the request of UBS Group AG, has agreed in 
writing that a Contingent Write-down or a Conversion, as applicable, is not 
required as a result of actions taken by the Group or circumstances or events, in 
each case, that have had, or imminently will have, the effect of restoring the 
CET1 Ratio as of the Balance Sheet Date relating to the relevant Ordinary 
Publication Date, after giving pro forma effect to such actions, circumstances or 
events, to a level above the Threshold Ratio that FINMA and UBS Group AG 
deem, in their sole discretion, to be adequate at such time, (x) the Issuer shall not 
give such Trigger Event Notice pursuant to subclause (i) of this Condition 7(b) 
in relation to the relevant Ordinary Publication Date, and (y) the Issuer shall give 
notice to the Holders on or prior to the Trigger Breach Determination Date in 
accordance with Condition 15 (Notices), which notice shall state that no 
Contingent Write-down or Conversion, as applicable, will occur in relation to 
the relevant Ordinary Publication Date.
(c) Viability Event
(i) Subject to clause (e) of this Condition 7, upon the occurrence of a Viability Event:
(A) the Issuer shall give notice (a "Viability Event Notice") to the Holders 
in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) within three days of the date 
on which such Viability Event occurred, which notice shall:
(1) if such Viability Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, (x) state that a Viability 
Event has occurred and a Contingent Write-down will take place 
and (y) specify the date on which the Contingent Write-down 
will take place, which date shall be no later than 10 Business
10280098139-v7 84 70-41069801
Days after the date of such notice (such specified date, the 
"Viability Event Write-down Date"); or
(2) if such Viability Event occurs on or after the occurrence of a 
Conversion Capital Availability Event, (w) state that a Viability 
Event has occurred and a Conversion will take place, (x) 
specify the date on which the Conversion will take place, which 
date shall be no more than 20 Business Days following the 
occurrence of the Viability Event (the "Viability Event 
Conversion Date"), (y) specify the Conversion Price in effect 
on the date of such Viability Event Notice, and (z) specify the 
details of the arrangements for the settlement of the Conversion 
(including, if the Settlement Share Depository is not SIX SIS, 
the details of the Settlement Share Depository); and
(B) if such Viability Event occurs prior to the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Contingent Write-down will occur on the 
applicable Viability Event Write-down Date in accordance Condition 8 
(Contingent Write-down); or
(C) if such Viability Event occurs on or after the occurrence of a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event, a Conversion will occur on the applicable 
Viability Event Conversion Date in accordance with Condition 9 
(Conversion).
(ii) A "Viability Event" will have occurred if prior to an Alternative Loss Absorption 
Date (if any):
(A) FINMA has notified UBS Group AG in writing that it has determined a 
conversion or write-down, as applicable, of holders' claims in respect of 
the Notes and all other capital instruments issued by, or other capital 
obligations (whether qualifying fully or partially for capital treatment) 
of, any member of the Group that, pursuant to their terms or by 
operation of law, are capable of being converted into equity or written 
down at that time, is, because customary measures to improve the 
Group Holding Company's capital adequacy are at the time inadequate 
or infeasible, an essential requirement to prevent the Group Holding 
Company from becoming insolvent, bankrupt, unable to pay a material 
part of its debts as they fall due or unable to carry on its business; or
(B) customary measures to improve the Group Holding Company's capital 
adequacy being at the time inadequate or infeasible, the Group Holding 
Company has received an irrevocable commitment of direct or indirect 
extraordinary support from the Public Sector (beyond customary 
transactions and arrangements in the ordinary course) that has, or 
imminently will have, the effect of improving the Group Holding 
Company's capital adequacy and without which, in the determination of 
(and as notified in writing by) FINMA, the Group Holding Company 
would have become insolvent, bankrupt, unable to pay a material part 
of its debts as they fall due or unable to carry on its business.
For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood that a Viability Event may occur 
irrespective of whether or not a Trigger Event has occurred or whether any of 
the conditions to the issuance of a Trigger Event Notice have been met.
(d) Determination of CET1 Ratio and Trigger CET1 Ratio
With respect to any Publication Date, (i) the CET1 Ratio as of the relevant Balance Sheet 
Date, (ii) the Trigger CET1 Ratio as of such Publication Date and (iii) the components of 
both of the foregoing, in each case, as published on such Publication Date, will be final for 
purposes of this Condition 7, and any revisions, restatements or adjustments to any of
10280098139-v7 85 70-41069801
the calculations described in subclauses (i) through (iii) of this clause (d) subsequently 
published will have no effect for purposes of this Condition 7.
(e) Alternative loss absorption
In the event of the implementation of any new, or amendment to or change in the 
interpretation of any existing, laws or components of National Regulations, in each case 
occurring after the Issue Date, that alone or together with any other law(s) or regulation(s) 
has, in the joint determination of UBS Group AG and FINMA, the effect that clause (c) 
of this Condition 7 could cease to apply to the Notes without giving rise to a Regulatory 
Event, then the Issuer shall give notice to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices) no later than five Business Days after such joint determination stating that such 
provisions will cease to apply from the date of such notice (the "Alternative Loss 
Absorption Date"), and from the date of such notice, such provisions will cease to apply 
to the Notes.
(f) Conversion Capital Availability Event
(i) A "Conversion Capital Availability Event" will have occurred on the first date 
after the Issue Date on which an amendment to the Articles of Association is 
registered in the main register (Hauptregister) of the Commercial Register 
(Handelsregister) of the Canton of Zurich as a result of which the Conversion 
Capital provided for in the Articles of Association meets or exceeds the Minimum 
Conversion Capital Availability Amount. For purposes of these Terms and 
Conditions, a Conversion Capital Availability Event may occur only once.
For purposes of the definition of Conversion Capital Availability Event:
"Articles of Association" means, at any time, the articles of association (Statuten) 
of UBS Group AG in effect at such time.
"Minimum Conversion Capital Availability Amount" means, at any time, the 
amount of Conversion Capital that UBS Group AG would require in order for it 
to create and issue:
(A) the number of Ordinary Shares into which the Notes outstanding at such 
time would be converted if they were to be converted at the Conversion 
Price in effect at such time and otherwise in accordance with these Terms 
and Conditions; and
(B) if any Other Tier 1 Contingent Convertible Capital Notes are outstanding 
at such time, the number of Ordinary Shares into which such Other Tier 1 
Contingent Convertible Capital Notes would be converted if they were 
to be converted at the conversion price then in effect pursuant to, and 
otherwise in accordance with, their respective terms at such time,
in each case, out of such Conversion Capital.
"Other Tier 1 Contingent Convertible Capital Note" means any capital 
instrument (other than the Notes) that:
(A) is eligible in full to be (x) treated as Additional Tier 1 Capital and
(y) counted towards either the Going-Concern LR Requirement or the 
Going-Concern RWA Requirement (or both); and
(B) subject to the terms and conditions thereof, is to be:
(x) converted into Ordinary Shares; or
(y) after a Conversion Capital Availability Event (or equivalent 
event described in the terms and conditions thereof) occurs, 
converted into Ordinary Shares,
10280098139-v7 86 70-41069801
in either case, when the CET1 Ratio (or equivalent capital measure of the 
Group described in the terms and conditions thereof) falls below a certain 
threshold and/or a Viability Event (or equivalent event described in the 
terms and conditions thereof) occurs.
As of 15 February 2024, the outstanding Other Tier 1 Contingent Convertible 
Capital Notes consisted of (1) the 9.250 per cent. Tier 1 Capital Notes (ISIN: 
US902613BF40 (144A); USH42097ES26 (Reg S)) issued by UBS Group AG in
an aggregate principal amount of USD 1,750,000,000 on 13 November 2023,
(2) the 9.250 per cent. Tier 1 Capital Notes (ISIN: US902613BE74 (144A); 
USH42097ER43 (Reg S)) issued by UBS Group AG in an aggregate principal 
amount of USD 1,750,000,000 on 13 November 2023, and (3) the 7.750 per 
cent. Tier 1 Capital Notes (ISIN: US902613BK35 (144A); USH42097EW38 
(Reg S))
issued by UBS Group AG in an aggregate principal amount of USD 
1,000,000,000 on 12 February 2024.
(ii) If a Conversion Capital Availability Event occurs at any time on or prior to a 
Trigger Event or a Viability Event, the Issuer shall as soon as practicable 
thereafter deliver to the Principal Paying Agent and the Settlement Agent a 
certificate signed by the Authorised Signatories and notice to the Holders in 
accordance with Condition 15 (Notices), in each case stating that a Conversion 
Capital Availability Event has occurred and the date on which it occurred.
8. CONTINGENT WRITE-DOWN
If the Issuer has given a Trigger Event Write-down Notice or a Viability Event Write-down Notice 
in accordance with Condition 7 (Trigger Event and Viability Event), then on the relevant Writedown Date:
(a) the full principal amount of, and any accrued and unpaid interest (whether or not due and 
payable) on, each Note will automatically be written down to zero, the Notes will be 
cancelled and all references to the principal amount of the Notes in these Terms and 
Conditions will be construed accordingly;
(b) the Holders will be automatically deemed to have irrevocably waived their right to 
receive, and will no longer have any rights against the Issuer with respect to, repayment 
of the aggregate principal amount of, and payment of any accrued and unpaid interest on, 
the Notes written down pursuant to subclause (a) of this Condition 8 (bedingter 
Forderungsverzicht); and
(c) all rights of any Holder for payment of any amounts under or in respect of the Notes 
(including, without limitation, any amounts arising as a result of, or due and payable 
upon the occurrence of, an Event of Default) will become null and void, irrespective of 
whether such amounts have become due and payable prior to the date of the relevant 
Trigger Event Notice or Viability Event Notice, as the case may be, or the Write-down 
Date.
9. CONVERSION
(a) Conversion upon a Trigger Event or a Viability Event
If the Issuer has given a Trigger Event Conversion Notice or a Viability Event Conversion 
Notice in accordance with Condition 7 (Trigger Event and Viability Event), then:
(i) each Note shall, subject to and as provided in this Condition 9, be redeemed and 
settled (the "Conversion") on the applicable Conversion Date by (x) the delivery 
of new fully paid Ordinary Shares to the Settlement Share Depository on behalf 
of the Holders, and (y) the cancellation of any accrued and unpaid interest on the 
Notes (whether or not due and payable); and
(ii) receipt by the Settlement Share Depository of such number of Ordinary Shares as 
is required to satisfy in full its obligation to deliver Ordinary Shares in respect of 
the Conversion on the applicable Conversion Date shall be a good and complete
10280098139-v7 87 70-41069801
discharge of the Issuer's (and, if UBS Group AG is not the Issuer, UBS Group 
AG's) obligations in respect of the Notes.
In the case of the Ordinary Shares to be delivered upon Conversion, as from the applicable 
Share Creation Date for such Ordinary Shares, there is no provision for the reconversion 
of such Ordinary Shares into Notes.
(b) Recourse for Ordinary Shares
Holders shall have recourse only to the Issuer for the issue and delivery of Ordinary 
Shares to the Settlement Share Depository pursuant to these Terms and Conditions. After 
such delivery to the Settlement Share Depository, Holders shall have recourse only to the 
Settlement Share Depository (or any relevant intermediary) for the delivery to them of 
such Ordinary Shares or, in the circumstances described in clause (h) of this Condition 9, 
any cash amounts to which such Holders are entitled under clause (h) of this Condition 9.
(c) Conversion Price and determination of number of Ordinary Shares
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Conversion Event, as at the date on which the relevant 
Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion Notice is 
published, each Holder shall be deemed to have accepted, and hereby accepts and 
agrees, (A) to the conversion of its holding of Notes into Ordinary Shares at the 
Conversion Price provided for herein and that, where necessary under Swiss law, 
the Settlement Agent shall effect such conversion on such Holder's behalf, and
(B) that its obligation to pay up the Ordinary Shares to be issued shall be set off 
against its claim for repayment of the principal amount upon redemption of the 
Notes, which claim shall be deemed to be due and payable immediately prior to 
the time on the Share Creation Date when, as a matter of Swiss law, the relevant 
Ordinary Shares are paid up. Such Ordinary Shares shall be paid up and issued on 
the Share Creation Date whereupon the Holders shall cease as a matter of Swiss 
law to be treated for all purposes under Swiss law as Holders and shall instead as 
of such date be treated for all purposes under Swiss law as Shareholders. 
(ii) Subject to clause (g) of this Condition 9, the Issuer, with the assistance of the 
Settlement Agent, where necessary under Swiss law, shall issue and deliver to the 
Settlement Share Depository on the applicable Conversion Date such number of 
Ordinary Shares in respect of each Holder as is determined by the Settlement 
Agent by dividing the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by such Holder 
on the applicable Conversion Date by the Conversion Price in effect on the date 
of relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability Event Conversion 
Notice, as the case may be. The Settlement Agent shall determine such number 
of Ordinary Shares in accordance with this subclause (ii) as soon as practicable 
after publication of the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or Viability 
Event Conversion Notice, as applicable.
(iii) The initial Conversion Price per Ordinary Share in respect of the Notes is 
specified in the definition thereof. The Conversion Price is subject to adjustment 
to (and including) the date of the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice or 
Viability Event Conversion Notice, as the case may be, in the circumstances 
described in clause (d) below.
(d) Anti-dilution adjustment of the Conversion Price
(i) Upon the occurrence of any of the events described below after 15 February 2024, 
the Conversion Price will be adjusted by the Issuer as follows:
(A) If there is a consolidation, reclassification, redesignation or subdivision 
in relation to the Ordinary Shares that alters the number of Ordinary 
Shares in issue, the Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the 
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to such consolidation, 
reclassification, redesignation or subdivision by the following fraction:
10280098139-v7 88 70-41069801
A is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately before such consolidation, reclassification, 
redesignation or subdivision, as the case may be; and
B is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately after, and as a result of, such consolidation, 
reclassification, redesignation or subdivision, as the case may 
be.
Such adjustment will become effective on the date on which the 
consolidation, reclassification, redesignation or subdivision, as the case 
may be, takes effect.
(B) If UBS Group AG issues any Ordinary Shares to Shareholders as a class 
credited as fully paid by way of capitalisation of profits or reserves 
(including any share premium account or capital redemption reserve) 
other than (x) where any such Ordinary Shares are or are to be issued 
instead of the whole or part of a Cash Distribution that the Shareholders 
would or could otherwise have elected to receive, (y) where the 
Shareholders may elect to receive a Cash Distribution in lieu of such 
Ordinary Shares or (z) where any such Ordinary Shares are or are 
expressed to be issued in lieu of a dividend (whether or not a Cash 
Distribution equivalent or amount is announced or would otherwise be 
payable to the Shareholders, whether at their election or otherwise), the 
Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price 
in force immediately prior to such issue by the following fraction:
A is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately before such issue; and
B is the aggregate number of Ordinary Shares in issue 
immediately after such issue.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the date of issue of such 
Ordinary Shares.
(C) If UBS Group AG makes or pays an Extraordinary Distribution to 
Shareholders, the Conversion Price will be adjusted by multiplying the 
Conversion Price in force immediately prior to the Effective Date by the 
following fraction:
A is the Current Market Price of one Ordinary Share on the 
Effective Date (translated, if necessary, into the Relevant 
Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the Effective Date); and
B is the portion of the aggregate Extraordinary Distribution 
attributable to one Ordinary Share, with such portion being 
determined by dividing the aggregate Extraordinary 
Distribution by the number of Ordinary Shares entitled to 
receive the relevant Extraordinary Distribution. If the 
Extraordinary Distribution shall be expressed in a currency 
other than the Relevant Currency, it shall be converted into the 
Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on the relevant 
Effective Date.
10280098139-v7 89 70-41069801
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date.
For purposes of this subclause (C), "Effective Date" means (x) the first 
date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-the Extraordinary 
Distribution on the Relevant Stock Exchange or (y) if there is no 
Relevant Stock Exchange, the first date upon which the adjusted 
Conversion Price is capable of being determined in accordance with this 
subclause (C).
(D) If UBS Group AG issues Ordinary Shares to Shareholders as a class by 
way of rights or UBS Group AG or any other member of the Group or 
(at the direction or request or pursuant to arrangements with UBS 
Group AG or any other member of the Group) any other Person issues 
or grants to Shareholders as a class by way of rights, any options, 
warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase Ordinary Shares, or 
any Securities that by their terms of issue carry (directly or indirectly) 
rights of conversion into, or exchange or subscription for, any Ordinary 
Shares (or shall grant any such rights in respect of existing Securities so 
issued), in each case at a price per Ordinary Share that is less than 95 
per cent. of the Current Market Price per Ordinary Share on the 
Effective Date (translated, if necessary, into the Relevant Currency at 
the Prevailing Rate on the Effective Date), the Conversion Price will be 
adjusted by multiplying the Conversion Price in force immediately prior 
to the Effective Date by the following fraction:
A is the number of Ordinary Shares in issue on the Effective Date;
B is the number of Ordinary Shares that the aggregate 
consideration (if any) receivable for the Ordinary Shares issued 
by way of rights, or for the Securities issued by way of rights, 
or for the options or warrants or other rights issued by way of 
rights and for the total number of Ordinary Shares deliverable 
on the exercise thereof, would purchase at such Current Market 
Price per Ordinary Share on the Effective Date (translated, if 
necessary, into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate on 
the Effective Date); and
C is the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued or the maximum 
number of Ordinary Shares that may be issued upon exercise of 
such options, warrants or rights calculated as at the date of issue 
of such options, warrants or rights or upon conversion or 
exchange or exercise of rights of subscription or purchase in 
respect thereof at the initial conversion, exchange, subscription 
or purchase price or rate, as the case may be,
provided that, if on the Effective Date, such number of Ordinary Shares 
is to be determined by reference to the application of a formula or other 
variable feature or the occurrence of any event at some subsequent time, 
then for the purposes of this subclause (D), "C" will be determined by the 
application of such formula or variable feature or as if the relevant event 
occurs or had occurred as at the Effective Date and as if such conversion, 
exchange, subscription, purchase or acquisition had taken place on the 
Effective Date.
Such adjustment shall become effective on the Effective Date.
For purposes of this subclause (D), "Effective Date" means (x) the first 
date on which the Ordinary Shares are traded ex-rights, ex-options or exwarrants on the Relevant Stock Exchange or (y) if there is no Relevant
10280098139-v7 90 70-41069801
Stock Exchange, the first date upon which the adjusted Conversion Price 
is capable of being determined in accordance with this subclause (D).
For purposes of any calculation of the consideration receivable or price 
pursuant to this subclause (D), the following provisions shall apply:
(1) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary 
Shares issued for cash shall be the amount of such cash;
(2) (x) the aggregate consideration receivable or price for Ordinary 
Shares to be issued or otherwise made available upon the 
conversion or exchange of any Securities will be deemed to be 
the consideration or price received or receivable for any such 
Securities and (y) the aggregate consideration receivable or 
price for Ordinary Shares to be issued or otherwise made 
available upon the exercise of rights of subscription attached to 
any Securities or upon the exercise of any options, warrants or 
rights will be deemed to be that part (which may be the whole) 
of the consideration or price received or receivable for such 
Securities or, as the case may be, for such options, warrants or 
rights that are attributed by UBS Group AG to such rights of 
subscription or, as the case may be, such options, warrants or 
rights or, if no part of such consideration or price is so attributed, 
the Fair Market Value of such rights of subscription or, as the 
case may be, such options, warrants or rights as at the relevant 
Effective Date, plus in the case of each of subclauses (x) and (y) 
above, the additional minimum consideration receivable or price 
(if any) upon the conversion or exchange of such Securities, or 
upon the exercise of such rights or subscription attached thereto 
or, as the case may be, upon exercise of such options, warrants 
or rights, and (z) the consideration receivable or price per 
Ordinary Share upon the conversion or exchange of, or upon the 
exercise of such rights of subscription attached to, such 
Securities or, as the case may be, upon the exercise of such 
options, warrants or rights will be the aggregate consideration or 
price referred to in subclause (x) or (y) above (as the case may 
be), divided by the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued upon 
such conversion or exchange or exercise at the initial 
conversion, exchange or subscription price or rate;
(3) if the consideration or price determined pursuant to 
subclause (1) or (2) above (or any component thereof) is 
expressed in a currency other than the Relevant Currency, it shall 
be converted into the Relevant Currency at the Prevailing Rate 
on the relevant Effective Date (in the case of subclause (1) 
above) or the relevant date of first public announcement (in the 
case of subclause (2) above);
(4) in determining the consideration or price pursuant to the above, 
no deduction shall be made for any commissions or fees 
(howsoever described) or any expenses paid or incurred for any 
underwriting, placing or management of the issue of the relevant 
Ordinary Shares or Securities or options, warrants or rights, or 
otherwise in connection therewith; and
(5) the consideration or price shall be determined as provided above 
on the basis of the consideration or price received, receivable, 
paid or payable, regardless of whether all or part thereof is 
received, receivable, paid or payable by or to UBS Group AG or 
another entity.
10280098139-v7 91 70-41069801
(E) If UBS Group AG determines, in its sole discretion, that, notwithstanding 
subclauses (A) to (D) of this Condition 9(d)(i), a reduction to the 
Conversion Price should be made as a result of one or more events or 
circumstances not referred to in this Condition 9(d)(i) that would require 
an adjustment to the Conversion Price in order to comply with Swiss 
mandatory law on the protection of holders of instruments that may 
convert into shares issued out of capital range (Kapitalband), conditional 
capital (bedingtes Kapital) or Conversion Capital, the Conversion Price 
will be reduced (either generally or for a specified period) in such manner 
and with effect from such date as UBS Group AG shall determine and 
the Issuer shall notify to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices).
(ii) Notwithstanding Condition 9(d)(i):
(A) where
(1) the events or circumstances giving rise to any adjustment to the 
Conversion Price have resulted or will result in an adjustment to 
the Conversion Price; or
(2) more than one event that gives rise to an adjustment to the 
Conversion Price occurs within such a short period of time,
that, in the opinion of UBS Group AG, a modification to the operation of 
the adjustment provisions set forth in this Condition 9(d) is required to 
give the intended result, such modification will be made to the operation 
of the adjustment provisions set forth in this Condition 9(d) as may be 
determined by an Independent Adviser to be in its opinion appropriate to 
give the intended result, including to ensure that (x) an adjustment to the 
Conversion Price or the economic effect thereof shall not be taken into 
account more than once, (y) the economic effect of an Extraordinary 
Distribution is not taken into account more than once, and (z) to reflect a 
redenomination of the issued Ordinary Shares for the time being into a 
new currency;
(B) any adjustment to the Conversion Price will be subject to such 
Conversion Price (translated, if necessary, into the currency in which 
the par value of an Ordinary Share is denominated at the time such 
adjustment becomes effective at the then-prevailing exchange rate as 
determined by the Issuer) not being less than the par value of an 
Ordinary Share at such time;
(C) UBS Group AG shall not take any action, and shall procure that no 
action is taken, that would otherwise result in an adjustment to the 
Conversion Price (translated, if necessary, into the currency in which 
the par value of an Ordinary Share is denominated at the time of such 
action at the then- prevailing exchange rate as determined by the Issuer) 
to below the par value of an Ordinary Share then in effect;
(D) if any doubt arises as to whether an adjustment is to be made to the 
Conversion Price or as to the appropriate adjustment to the Conversion 
Price, the Issuer may in its sole discretion appoint an Independent 
Adviser and, following consultation between the Issuer and such 
Independent Adviser, a written opinion of such Independent Adviser in 
respect thereof will (in the absence of wilful default, bad faith and 
manifest error) be conclusive and binding on the Issuer and the Holders;
(E) no adjustment will be made to the Conversion Price where Ordinary 
Shares or other securities (including rights, warrants and options) are 
issued, offered, exercised, allotted, purchased, appropriated, modified or
10280098139-v7 92 70-41069801
granted to, or for the benefit of, employees or former employees 
(including directors holding or formerly holding executive office or the 
personal service company of any such person) or their spouses or 
relatives, in each case, of UBS Group AG or any of its subsidiaries or 
any associated company or to a trustee or trustees to be held for the 
benefit of any such person, in any such case pursuant to any share or 
option scheme; and
(F) on any adjustment, if the resultant Conversion Price has more decimal 
places than the initial Conversion Price, it will be rounded to the same 
number of decimal places as the initial Conversion Price. No adjustment 
will be made to the Conversion Price where such adjustment (rounded 
down if applicable) would be less than one per cent. of the Conversion 
Price then in effect. Any adjustment not required to be made, and/or any 
amount by which the Conversion Price has been rounded down, will be 
carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment, and 
such subsequent adjustment will be made on the basis that the adjustment 
not required to be made had been made at the relevant time and/or that 
the relevant rounding down had not been made, as the case may be.
(iii) The Issuer shall give notice of any adjustments to the Conversion Price made 
pursuant to this Condition 9(d) to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 
(Notices) promptly after the determination thereof.
(iv) References in these Terms and Conditions to any issue or offer or grant to 
Shareholders "as a class" or "by way of rights" shall be taken to be references to 
an issue or offer or grant to all or substantially all Shareholders, other than 
Shareholders to whom, by reason of the laws of any territory or requirements of 
any recognised regulatory body or any other stock exchange or securities market 
in any territory or in connection with fractional entitlements, it is determined not 
to make such issue or offer or grant.
(e) Qualifying Relevant Event
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Relevant Event that is a Qualifying Relevant Event,

Price that shall be the New Conversion Price; and
(2) the Issuer shall procure the issue and/or delivery of the relevant 
number of Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity in the manner 
provided in this Condition 9 (as may be amended as described 
in the definition of the term New Conversion Condition); and

10280098139-v7 93 70-41069801
(ii) Upon the occurrence of a Relevant Event, the Issuer shall give notice thereof to 
the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) within 10 Business Days 
following the occurrence of such Relevant Event, which notice shall:

(B) specify whether the Relevant Event is a Qualifying Relevant Event or a 
Non-Qualifying Relevant Event;
(C) in the case of a Qualifying Relevant Event, specify the New Conversion 
Price; and
(D) if applicable, specify the New Conversion Condition Effective Date.
(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, upon the occurrence of a Relevant Event that is a 
Non-Qualifying Relevant Event, the provisions of this clause (e) shall (subject to 
the subsequent operation of this clause (e) upon the occurrence of a subsequent 
Relevant Event) not apply, and the Notes will continue to be convertible into 
Ordinary Shares pursuant to and in accordance with the other provisions of this 
Condition 9 (Conversion), if and when the Issuer gives a Trigger Event 
Conversion Notice or a Viability Event Conversion Notice in accordance with 
Condition 7 (Trigger Event and Viability Event).
(iv) For purposes of these Terms and Conditions:
"Acquiror" means the Person (including a Governmental Entity) that, following 
a Relevant Event, controls UBS Group AG.
"Approved Entity" means an Acquiror that is body corporate that is 
incorporated or established under the laws of an OECD member state and that, 
on the occurrence of the Relevant Event, has in issue Relevant Shares.
"Governmental Entity" means (x) the Swiss Confederation, (y) an agency of the 
Swiss Confederation or (z) a person or entity (other than a body corporate) 
controlled by the Swiss Confederation or any such agency referred to in clause (y); 
provided, however, that, if UBS Group AG is at any time organised in a 
jurisdiction outside of Switzerland, references in this definition to "the Swiss 
Confederation" shall be read as references to the government of such other 
jurisdiction.
The "New Conversion Condition" shall be satisfied in respect of a Relevant 
Event if, by no later than seven days following the occurrence of such Relevant 
Event, (x) UBS Group AG has, to the satisfaction of UBS Group AG, entered into 
arrangements with the Approved Entity that provide for delivery of Relevant 
Shares of the Approved Entity on Conversion on terms mutatis mutandis as 
provided in the provisions of this Condition 9, and (y) the Issuer has entered into 
such agreements and arrangements, and made such amendments to these Terms 
and Conditions, as may be required to ensure that, with effect from the New 
Conversion Condition Effective Date, the Notes shall, following the occurrence of 
a Conversion Event, be convertible into, or exchangeable for, Relevant Shares of 
the Approved Entity, mutatis mutandis in accordance with, and subject to, this 
Condition 9 (as may be so amended) at the New Conversion Price; provided, 
however, that, any failure to enter into the arrangements and agreements and/or 
make the amendments described in clauses (x) and (y) shall not constitute a 
default or an Event of Default under these Terms and Conditions.
"New Conversion Condition Effective Date" means the date with effect from 
which the New Conversion Condition has been satisfied.
10280098139-v7 94 70-41069801
"New Conversion Price" means, in respect of any Conversion Date falling on or 
after the New Conversion Condition Effective Date, the amount determined by the

where:
NCP is the New Conversion Price.
ECP is the Conversion Price in effect on the last dealing day prior 
to the New Conversion Condition Effective Date.
VWAPRS is the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the 
Relevant Shares of the Approved Entity (translated, if 
necessary, into SGD at the Prevailing Rate on the relevant 
dealing day) on each of the five dealing days ending on the 
last dealing day prior to the date on which the Relevant 
Event occurred (and where references in the definition of 
"Volume Weighted Average Price" to "Ordinary Shares" 
shall be construed as a reference to the Relevant Shares of 
the Approved Entity and in the definition of "dealing day", 
references to the "Relevant Stock Exchange" shall be to the 
primary Recognised Stock Exchange on which the Relevant 
Shares of the Approved Entity are then listed, admitted to 
trading or accepted for dealing).
VWAPOS is the average of the Volume Weighted Average Price of the 
Ordinary Shares (translated, if necessary, into SGD at the 
Prevailing Rate on the relevant dealing day) on each of the 
five dealing days ending on the last dealing day prior to the 
date on which the Relevant Event occurred.
"Non-Qualifying Relevant Event" means a Relevant Event that is not a 
Qualifying Relevant Event.
"Qualifying Relevant Event" means a Relevant Event where:
(A) the Acquiror is an Approved Entity; and

A "Relevant Event" will have occurred if, on or after the occurrence of a

Reorganisation). For the purposes of this definition "Relevant Event", "control" 
means the acquisition or holding of legal or beneficial ownership of more than 95 
per cent. of the issued Ordinary Shares of UBS Group AG (whether obtained 
directly or indirectly and whether obtained by ownership of share capital, contract 
or otherwise) and, as a consequence thereof, the Ordinary Shares are no longer 
admitted to trading on any Recognised Stock Exchange, and "controlled" shall be 
construed accordingly.
"Relevant Shares" means, in respect of an Acquiror, ordinary share capital of 
such Acquiror that constitutes equity share capital or the equivalent (or depositary 
or other receipts representing the same) that is listed and admitted to trading on a 
Recognised Stock Exchange.
10280098139-v7 95 70-41069801
(f) Procedure for settlement and delivery of Ordinary Shares on Conversion
Ordinary Shares to be issued on Conversion shall be delivered subject to and as provided 
below.
(g) Fractions
Fractions of Ordinary Shares will not be issued or delivered pursuant to these Terms and 
Conditions on Conversion and no cash payment will be made in lieu thereof. The number 
of Ordinary Shares to be issued and delivered to the Settlement Share Depository for the 
benefit of each Holder in respect of a Conversion shall be calculated by the Settlement 
Agent on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of Notes held by such Holder on the 
applicable Conversion Date and rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number 
of Ordinary Shares.
(h) Procedure for delivery in respect of a Conversion
(i) UBS Group AG, with the assistance of the Settlement Agent where necessary 
under Swiss law, shall on or prior to the applicable Conversion Date issue and 
deliver to the Settlement Share Depository such number of Ordinary Shares as is 
required to satisfy in full its obligation to deliver Ordinary Shares to the Holders 
in respect of the Conversion on the applicable Conversion Date. Receipt by the 
Settlement Share Depository of such Ordinary Shares shall be a good and 
complete discharge of the Issuer's (and, if UBS Group AG is not the Issuer, UBS 
Group AG's) obligations in respect of the Notes.
(ii) Subject to the making of a Settlement Shares Offer and as otherwise provided 
herein, the Settlement Agent shall give instructions to the Settlement Share 
Depository for the relevant Ordinary Shares to be delivered by the Settlement 
Share Depository on the applicable Conversion Date to the Holders, and the 
Settlement Share Depository shall take such actions as are customary to effect 
such delivery of such Ordinary Shares to the Holders on the applicable 
Conversion Date.
(iii) In respect of a Conversion as a result of the occurrence of a Trigger Event only, 
following receipt by the Settlement Share Depository of the Ordinary Shares and 
the resulting good and complete discharge of the Issuer's obligations in respect 
of the Notes as described in subclause (i) above, the Issuer may, in its sole 
discretion, appoint a placement agent (the "Settlement Shares Offer Agent") 
acting on behalf, and for the accounts, of the Holders to conduct an offering of 
the Ordinary Shares to which the Holders are otherwise entitled (a "Settlement 
Shares Offer"). In the relevant Trigger Event Conversion Notice, the Issuer 
shall notify the Holders whether it will appoint such Settlement Shares Offer 
Agent to conduct such a Settlement Shares Offer. If it does so appoint a 
Settlement Shares Offer Agent, it will instruct the Settlement Share Depository 
to deliver the relevant Ordinary Shares to or to the order of the Settlement 
Shares Offer Agent for this purpose prior to the end of the Offer Settlement 
Period. Such Settlement Shares Offer shall be made (x) in the currency of the 
Issuer's choosing and at a cash price per Ordinary Share (such price translated, if 
necessary, into SGD at the prevailing exchange rate on the date of the Trigger 
Event Conversion Notice as determined by the Issuer) equal to the Conversion 
Price in effect on the date of the Trigger Event Conversion Notice, and (y) to 
some or, subject to applicable laws and regulations and to such an offer being 
practicable in the opinion of the Issuer in the Offer Settlement Period, all 
Shareholders on the record date of the Trigger Event Conversion Notice then 
eligible to participate in such offer. Any such Settlement Shares Offer shall be 
completed no later than 20 Business Days after the occurrence of the Trigger 
Event (the "Offer Settlement Period"). Neither the Issuer nor the Settlement 
Share Depository shall incur any liability whatsoever to the Holders in respect of 
the appointment of such Settlement Shares Offer Agent or its conduct, save for 
cases of gross negligence or wilful intent.
10280098139-v7 96 70-41069801
If the Settlement Shares Offer is fully subscribed by or before the end of the Offer 
Settlement Period, the Holders shall, pursuant to the agreement appointing the 
Settlement Shares Offer Agent, be entitled to receive from the Settlement Shares 
Offer Agent on the fifth Business Day after the end of the Offer Settlement Period, 
their pro rata share of the aggregate cash proceeds received from the Settlement 
Shares Offer (such aggregate cash proceeds translated, if necessary, from the 
currency in which they are denominated into SGD at the then-prevailing exchange 
rate as determined by the Settlement Shares Offer Agent (less any foreign 
exchange transaction costs)), such amount being rounded to the nearest cent (half 
a cent being rounded upwards). If the Settlement Shares Offer is only partially 
subscribed by the end of the Offer Settlement Period, the Holders shall (x) 
pursuant to the agreement appointing the Settlement Shares Offer Agent, be 
entitled to receive from the Settlement Shares Offer Agent on the fifth Business 
Day after the end of the Offer Settlement Period, their pro rata share of the 
aggregate cash proceeds received from the Settlement Shares Offer (such 
aggregate cash proceeds translated, if necessary, from the currency in which they 
are denominated into SGD at the then-prevailing exchange rate as determined by 
the Settlement Shares Offer Agent (less any foreign exchange transaction costs)), 
such amount being rounded to the nearest cent (half a cent being rounded 
upwards), and (y) be entitled to receive their pro rata share of the number of 
Ordinary Shares not subscribed pursuant to the Settlement Shares Offer (rounded 
down to the nearest whole number of such Ordinary Shares) within the period 
specified below from the Settlement Share Depository. If no Ordinary Shares are 
subscribed in the Settlement Shares Offer, Holders shall be entitled to receive the 
relevant Ordinary Shares within the period specified below from the Settlement 
Share Depository.
In relation to any Ordinary Shares not sold pursuant to a Settlement Shares Offer, 
the Settlement Agent shall give instructions to the Settlement Shares Offer Agent 
for such Ordinary Shares to be delivered by the Settlement Shares Offer Agent to 
the relevant Holders within five Business Days after the end of the Offer 
Settlement Period.
(i) Taxes and duties
None of the Issuer, any other member of the Group, any Agent and the Settlement Share 
Depository will pay any capital, stamp, issue, registration, transfer or other taxes or 
duties arising upon Conversion or that may arise or be paid as a consequence of or in 
connection with the issue and delivery of Ordinary Shares to the Settlement Share 
Depository or to any Holder. A Holder must pay any capital, stamp, issue, registration, 
transfer or other taxes or duties arising upon Conversion or that may arise or be paid as a 
consequence of or in connection with the issue and delivery of the Ordinary Shares to the 
Settlement Share Depository or to such Holder and such Holder must pay all, if any, such 
taxes and duties arising by reference to any disposal or deemed disposal of such Holder's 
Notes or interest therein. Any capital, stamp, issue, registration, transfer or other taxes or 
duties arising on delivery or transfer of Ordinary Shares to a purchaser in any Settlement 
Shares Offer shall be payable by the relevant purchaser of those Ordinary Shares.
(j) Delivery of Ordinary Shares
UBS Group AG, with the assistance of the Settlement Agent where necessary under 
Swiss law, will issue and deliver the Ordinary Shares required to be issued and delivered 
on Conversion to the Settlement Share Depository on behalf of the Holder of the relevant 
Note(s). Receipt by the Settlement Share Depository of such Ordinary Shares will be a 
good and complete discharge of the Issuer's obligations in respect of the Notes as 
described in subclause (h)(i) of this Condition 9.
Such Ordinary Shares will be delivered to Holders in uncertificated form through SIX 
SIS or any other appropriate settlement organisations. Where such Ordinary Shares are to 
be delivered through SIX SIS or any other appropriate intermediary (Verwahrungsstelle) 
in Switzerland, the Settlement Agent shall request that the Settlement Share Depository
10280098139-v7 97 70-41069801
deliver such Ordinary Shares to the account(s) in which the relevant Note(s) is/are held, 
on the applicable Conversion Date or such other date as is specified for the delivery. At 
the time of such delivery of the Ordinary Shares, the then-valid share registration rules of 
UBS Group AG will apply, and UBS Group AG does not offer any assurance or 
guarantee that any Holder will be accepted as a Shareholder with voting rights in the 
share register of UBS Group AG.
(k) Ordinary Shares
The Ordinary Shares issued and delivered on Conversion will be fully paid and nonassessable and will in all respects rank pari passu with the fully paid Ordinary Shares in 
issue on the relevant Share Creation Date, except in any such case for any right excluded 
by mandatory provisions of applicable law, and except that the Ordinary Shares so issued 
and delivered will not rank for (or, as the case may be, the relevant Holder will not be 
entitled to receive) any rights, distributions or payments the record date or other due date 
for the establishment of entitlement for which falls prior to the relevant Share Creation 
Date.
(l) Purchase or redemption of Ordinary Shares
UBS Group AG or any of its subsidiaries may exercise such rights as it may from time to 
time enjoy to purchase or redeem or buy back any shares or securities of UBS Group AG 
(including Ordinary Shares) or any depositary or other receipts or certificates representing 
the same without the consent of Holders.
(m) Determinations to be made by an Independent Adviser
In the case of any determination that is required to be made by an Independent Adviser 
for purposes of this Condition 9, the Issuer shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint an 
Independent Adviser to make such determination; provided, however, that, 
notwithstanding the other provisions of these Terms and Conditions, if the Issuer is 
unable to so appoint an Independent Adviser or the Independent Adviser so appointed by 
the Issuer fails to make such determination, the Issuer, acting in good faith and a 
commercially reasonable manner, will make such determination.
Any determination that is made by an Independent Adviser for purposes of this 
Condition 9 will be made in the sole discretion of such Independent Adviser acting in 
good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner.
(n) Notifications, etc. to be final
All notifications, opinions, determinations, certificates, calculations, quotations and 
decisions given, expressed, made or obtained by an Independent Adviser or the 
Settlement Agent for purposes of this Condition 9 will (in the absence of wilful default, 
bad faith and manifest error) be binding on the Issuer, the Agents and the Holders and (in 
the absence of wilful default and bad faith) no liability to the Issuer or the Holders will 
attach to the Independent Adviser or the Settlement Agent in connection with the 
exercise or non- exercise by the Independent Adviser or the Settlement Agent of its 
powers, duties and discretions under this Condition 9.
10. PAYMENTS; AGENTS
(a) All payments required to be made under the Notes will be made available in good time 
in freely disposable funds in SGD, which will be placed at the free disposal of the 
Principal Paying Agent on behalf of the Holders. If the Scheduled Due Date for any 
payment (whether in respect of principal, interest or otherwise) in respect of the Notes is 
not a Payment Business Day, then the Holders will not be entitled to payment thereof 
until the first Payment Business Day following the Scheduled Due Date, and the Holders 
will not be entitled to any additional sum in relation to such payment. All payments 
required to be made under the Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any 
Additional Amounts) shall be made to the Holders in SGD without collection costs, 
without any restrictions and whatever the circumstances may be, irrespective of 
nationality, domicile or residence of
10280098139-v7 98 70-41069801
the relevant Holder and without certification, affidavit or the fulfilment of any other 
formality.
(b) The receipt by the Principal Paying Agent of the due and punctual payment of funds in 
SGD will release the Issuer from its obligations under the Notes to the extent of such 
payment.
(c) Subject to clause (d) of this Condition 10, the Issuer reserves the right to terminate the 
appointment of any Agent, as well as to appoint or, after any such appointment, to 
terminate the appointment of, one or more other paying agents to carry out any payment 
or other similar functions in respect of the Notes (each, a "Paying Agent", which term 
includes the Principal Paying Agent), provided that (i) so long as any Note is 
outstanding, there will at all times be a Principal Paying Agent, a Calculation Agent and 
a Settlement Agent, (ii) for so long as the Notes are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange 
and if then required by the regulations of the SIX Swiss Exchange, the Issuer shall 
maintain a Paying Agent in Switzerland, which agent shall have an office in Switzerland 
and be a bank or securities dealer subject to supervision by FINMA, to perform the 
functions of a Swiss paying agent, and (iii) any successor Calculation Agent must be a 
leading bank or financial institution that is experienced in the calculations and 
determinations to be made by the Calculation Agent.
(d) Any appointment or termination of appointment of a Paying Agent may only take effect 
not more than 45 and not less than 30 days' after the Issuer has notified the Holders of 
such appointment or termination in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices); provided, 
however, that, in the case of insolvency of any Paying Agent, any termination of such 
Paying Agent and appointment of any other Paying Agent will take immediate effect.
(e) Subject to clause (c) of this Condition 10, the Issuer may appoint, or terminate the 
appointment of, any Settlement Agent or Calculation Agent at any time. The Issuer shall 
promptly notify the Holders of any such appointment or termination in accordance with 
Condition 15 (Notices).
(f) If at any time the Calculation Agent fails to (i) determine the Reference Rate or the Reset 
Interest Rate or duly calculate the Reset Interest Amount for any Reset Interest Period or 
the interest amount payable on the relevant Redemption Date (if the Notes are to be 
redeemed pursuant to Condition 6 (Redemption and Purchase)) or (ii) comply with any 
other requirement in relation to the Notes, then the Issuer will terminate the appointment 
of the Calculation Agent in accordance with the Agency Agreement and appoint a 
successor Calculation Agent.
11. TAXATION
(a) All payments to be made by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Notes (including, 
for the avoidance of doubt, payments by a Paying Agent) shall be made without 
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, 
assessments or other government charges of any nature ("Taxes") imposed, levied, 
collected, withheld or assessed by or on behalf of any Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof or any authority of or in a Tax Jurisdiction or any political 
subdivision thereof having the power to impose, levy, collect, withhold or assess Taxes, 
unless withholding, deduction or accounting for such Taxes is required by law.
(b) In the event that any payment to be made by or on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the 
Notes (including, for the avoidance of doubt, payments by a Paying Agent) is subject to 
any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes by requirement of law in a 
Tax Jurisdiction (as determined by the relevant tax authority of or in such Tax 
Jurisdiction), the Issuer shall pay such additional amounts as will result in the Holders 
receiving the amounts that they would have received in respect of the Notes if no such 
withholding or deduction had been required ("Additional Amounts").
10280098139-v7 99 70-41069801
(c) No Additional Amounts will be payable pursuant to clause (b) of this Condition 11 in 
relation to any Note:
(i) if the relevant Holder is liable for such Taxes on such Note as a result of having 
some connection with the relevant Tax Jurisdiction other than its mere ownership 
or possession of such Note or the receipt of principal or interest in respect thereof; 
or
(ii) with respect to any Tax collected pursuant to the provisions of, or any laws or an 
agreement with any Tax Jurisdiction relating to, Sections 1471 through 1474 of 
the US Internal Revenue Code, as amended (commonly referred to as 
"FATCA"); or
(iii) where such withholding or deduction is required to be made pursuant to laws 
enacted by Switzerland providing for the taxation of payments according to 
principles similar to those laid down in the draft legislation of the Swiss Federal 
Council of 3 April 2020, or otherwise changing the Swiss federal withholding 
tax system from an issuer-based system to a paying agent-based system pursuant 
to which a Person other than the issuer is required to withhold tax on any interest 
payments; or
(iv) to the extent any combination of subclauses (i) through (iii) of this clause (c) 
applies.
(d) Any reference in these Terms and Conditions to amounts payable by the Issuer in respect 
of the Notes includes (i) any Additional Amount payable pursuant to this Condition 11 
and (ii) any sum payable pursuant to an obligation taken in addition to or in substitution 
for the obligation in this Condition 11.
12. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
In accordance with Swiss law, (a) claims for interest payments under the Notes will become timebarred after the five-year period and (b) claims for the repayment or redemption of Notes will 
become time-barred after the 10-year period, in each case, commencing on the date on which such 
payments, repayment or redemption become due and payable.
13. EVENTS OF DEFAULT
(a) If any of the following events occurs, such occurrence will constitute an "Event of 
Default":
(i) the Issuer fails to pay the principal amount of any Note if and when the same 
becomes due and payable under these Terms and Conditions, and such failure 
continues unremedied for a period of 30 days; or
(ii) the Issuer fails to pay any interest on the Notes if and when the same becomes 
due and payable under these Terms and Conditions, and such failure continues 
unremedied for a period of 30 days; or
(iii) the Issuer fails to observe or perform any other covenant, condition, or agreement 
contained in these Terms and Conditions, and such failure continues unremedied 
for a period of 60 days after written notice thereof from any Holder to the Issuer; 
or
(iv) a Bankruptcy Event;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding subclauses (i) to (iv) above, neither (A) the 
opening of Restructuring Proceedings with respect to the Issuer nor (B) the exercise of 
any Swiss Resolution Power with respect to the Issuer during any such Restructuring 
Proceedings nor (C) the ordering of any Protective Measures with respect to the Issuer that 
are ordered or confirmed upon the opening of or during any such Restructuring 
Proceedings will constitute a default or an Event of Default.
10280098139-v7 100 70-41069801
(b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default relating to any failure of the Issuer to meet 
any payment obligation under these Terms and Conditions and subject to Condition 8 
(Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), (i) such payment obligation 
(and such payment obligation only) will be immediately deemed a due and payable 
(fällige) payment obligation of the Issuer, and (ii) if (A) the relevant Holder has formally 
requested payment of such payment obligation, (B) such payment obligation has not 
been fulfilled within the statutory period under Swiss law commencing after the date of 
such formal request and (C) a writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl) has been issued with 
respect to such payment obligation pursuant to the DEBA, the relevant Holder may 
institute proceedings against the Issuer in Switzerland (but not elsewhere) to enforce its 
rights with respect to such payment obligation under the DEBA.
(c) If a debt collection or insolvency proceeding with respect to the Issuer is instituted in 
Switzerland in accordance with clause (b) of this Condition 13, the Issuer shall not (i) after 
having received the writ of payment (Zahlungsbefehl) relating to the relevant payment 
obligation, argue or plead that such payment obligation is not due and payable by the 
Issuer, or (ii) prior to the declaration of bankruptcy (or similar proceeding under Swiss 
insolvency laws), make any payment to the relevant Holder under or in connection with 
the Notes.
(d) In the case of any Event of Default arising under subclause (a)(iii) of this Condition 13 
and subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), any 
Holder may seek specific performance or damages with respect to such Event of Default 
pursuant to the Swiss Code if so entitled thereunder. Any such damage claim of any Holder 
will rank junior to the rights and claims of all holders of Senior Obligations.
(e) In the case of any Event of Default arising under subclause (a)(iv) of this Condition 13 
and subject to Condition 8 (Contingent Write-down) and Condition 9 (Conversion), any 
Holder may, by written notice to the Issuer, declare the principal amount of any of its 
Notes, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, immediately due and 
payable, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind.
(f) No remedy against the Issuer other than those described in this Condition 13 will be 
available to the Holders in connection with the Issuer's obligations under these Terms and 
Conditions, whether for the recovery of amounts owing under these Terms and Conditions 
or in respect of any breach by the Issuer of any of its other obligations under these Terms 
and Conditions or otherwise. In particular, no Holder may declare (i) the principal amount 
of any Notes due and payable prior to any Redemption Date, or (ii) any interest on any 
Notes due and payable prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, except, in the case of 
each of subclauses (i) and (ii) of this clause (f), pursuant to clause (e) of this Condition 13.
14. MEETINGS OF HOLDERS; SUBSTITUTION AND AMENDMENT
(a) Except as otherwise specified in this Condition 14, the provisions of bondholder meetings 
contained in article 1157 et seqq. of the Swiss Code apply in relation to meetings of 
Holders.
(b) If a Tax Event or a Regulatory Event has occurred, the Issuer may, without the consent of 
the Holders, either substitute all, but not some only, of the Notes for, or amend these Terms 
and Conditions so that they remain or become, Compliant Securities, provided that:
(i) neither a Tax Event nor a Regulatory Event arises as a result of such substitution 
or amendment;
(ii) FINMA has approved such substitution or amendment (if such approval is then 
required under applicable Swiss laws and regulations);
(iii) the Issuer has given the Holders not less than 30 days' notice of such substitution 
or amendment in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices), which notice will, 
subject to subclause (v) of this clause (b), be irrevocable, and state the date on
10280098139-v7 101 70-41069801
which such substitution or amendment will be effective (the "Substitution or 
Amendment Effective Date");
(iv) prior to the publication of any notice pursuant to subclause (iii) of this clause (b), 
the Issuer shall deliver to the Principal Paying Agent (A) a certificate signed by 
the Authorised Signatories stating that the relevant requirement or circumstance 
giving rise to the right to substitute or amend the terms of the Notes, as 
applicable, pursuant to this clause (b) is satisfied and the reasons therefor and 
such certificate will be conclusive and binding on the Holders, and (B) an 
opinion of independent legal advisers of recognised standing to the effect that 
circumstances entitling the Issuer to exercise its right to substitute or amend the 
terms of the Notes, as applicable, pursuant to this clause (b) have arisen; and
(v) no Trigger Event or Viability Event has occurred prior to the relevant Substitution 
or Amendment Effective Date.
In connection with any substitution or amendment in accordance with this clause (b), the 
Issuer shall comply with the rules of any stock exchange on which the Notes are for the 
time being listed or admitted to trading.
(c) In addition to its rights under clause (b) of this Condition 14, the Issuer may, without the 
consent of the Holders, make any amendment to these Terms and Conditions that it 
considers to be (i) necessary or desirable to give effect to (A) any Alternative 
Benchmark Rate determined in accordance with clause (c) of Condition 5 (Interest) 
(including any Adjustment Spread determined in accordance with subclause (v)(A)(2) 
thereof and any alternative method for determining the Reference Rate if such 
Alternative Benchmark Rate is unavailable on the relevant Reset Determination Date 
determined in accordance with subclause (v)(A)(3) thereof), and any related changes to

16. ISSUER SUBSTITUTION
(a) The Issuer (for purposes of this Condition 16, the "Current Issuer") may, without the 
consent of the Holders, substitute any entity (whether or not such entity is organised 
under the laws of Switzerland) (such substitute entity, the "Substitute Issuer") for itself 
as principal debtor under the Notes upon giving no more than 30 and no less than 10 
days' notice to the Holders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices), provided that:
(i) the Substitute Issuer is UBS Group AG or at least 95 per cent. of the Substitute 
Issuer's capital and voting rights are held, directly or indirectly, by UBS Group 
AG;
(ii) the Current Issuer is not in default in respect of any amount payable under the 
Notes at the time of such substitution;
(iii) if the Substitute Issuer is not UBS Group AG, UBS Group AG has irrevocably 
and unconditionally guaranteed to the Holders, pursuant to article 111 of the 
Swiss Code and on a subordinated basis corresponding mutatis mutandis to 
Condition 4 (Status and Subordination), (A) the due and punctual payment of 
principal and interest and all other amounts due and payable by the Substitute 
Issuer under, or in respect of, the Notes upon receipt of the written request for 
payment of the relevant amount, and (B) upon the occurrence of a Conversion, 
the due delivery of the Ordinary Shares required to be delivered pursuant to 
Condition 9 (Conversion), and on the terms whereby subclause (iii) of Condition 
5(i) (Cancellation of interest; prohibited interest), subclause (d)(ii)(C) of 
Condition 9 (Conversion), Condition 11 (Taxation), Condition 13 (Events of 
Default) and Condition 21 (No Set-off by Holders) apply to UBS Group AG and 
to its obligations under such guarantee either by making the necessary 
consequential amendments to such Conditions or including such Conditions 
applicable to UBS Group AG and to its obligations under such guarantee in such 
guarantee itself, as applicable;
(iv) the Current Issuer and the Substitute Issuer (A) have entered into such documents 
(the "Substitution Documents") as are necessary to give effect to such 
substitution and pursuant to which the Substitute Issuer has (x) undertaken in 
favour of each Holder to be bound by these Terms and Conditions as the principal 
debtor (on a subordinated basis corresponding to Condition 4 (Status and 
Subordination)) under the Notes in place of the Current Issuer and (y) assumed 
the obligations of the Current Issuer under the Agency Agreement, and
(B) procure that all action, conditions and things required to be taken, fulfilled 
and done (including, without limitation, the obtaining of any necessary consents) 
to ensure that the Substitution Documents represent valid, legally binding and 
enforceable obligations of the Substitute Issuer have been taken, fulfilled and 
done and are in full force and effect;
(v) if the Substitute Issuer is resident for tax purposes in a jurisdiction (the "New 
Residence") other than that in which the Current Issuer prior to such substitution 
was resident for tax purposes (the "Former Residence"), the Substitution 
Documents contain an undertaking by the Substitute Issuer and/or such other 
provisions as may be necessary to ensure that each Holder has the benefit of an 
undertaking in terms corresponding to the provisions of Condition 11 (Taxation) 
in relation to the payment of all amounts due and payable under, or in respect of, 
the Notes and in relation to the guarantee referred to in subclause (iii) above, with, 
in the case of the Notes but not such guarantee, the substitution of references to 
the Former Residence with references to the New Residence, and an undertaking 
by the Substitute Issuer to indemnify each Holder against any Tax that is imposed 
on it by (or by any authority in or of) the New Residence and, if different, the
10280098139-v7 103 70-41069801
jurisdiction of the Substitute Issuer's organisation with respect to any Note and 
that would not have been so imposed had the substitution not been made, as well 
as against any Tax, and any cost or expense, relating to such substitution;
(vi) if the Substitute Issuer is not UBS Group AG, FINMA has approved such 
substitution (if such approval is then required under applicable Swiss laws and 
regulations), and the Current Issuer and the Substitute Issuer have obtained all 
other necessary governmental and other approvals and consents for such 
substitution and for the performance by the Substitute Issuer of its obligations 
under the Substitution Documents;
(vii) if the Substitute Issuer is not organised under the laws of Switzerland, the 
Substitute Issuer has appointed a process agent as its agent in Switzerland to 
receive service of process on its behalf in relation to any legal proceedings 
arising out of or in connection with the Notes;
(viii) such substitution does not give rise to a Tax Event or a Regulatory Event; and
(ix) the Substitute Issuer has appointed a Paying Agent in Switzerland that is a 
participant in the Intermediary.
(b) Upon any substitution pursuant to clause (a) of this Condition 16, (i) the Substitute Issuer 
will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the 
Current Issuer under the Notes with the same effect as if the Substitute Issuer had been 
named as Issuer in these Terms and Conditions, and (ii) the Current Issuer will be 
released from its obligations under the Notes.
(c) After giving effect to any substitution pursuant to clause (a) of this Condition 16,
(i) references to the "Issuer" in the Notes and these Terms and Conditions will be 
references to the Substitute Issuer, and (ii) references to the "Tax Jurisdiction" in the 
Notes and these Terms and Conditions will be read and construed as including the 
jurisdiction of establishment of the Substitute Issuer and, if different, the jurisdiction in 
which the Substitute Issuer is resident for tax purposes instead of or in addition to (as the 
case may be) references to the jurisdiction of establishment of the Issuer and 
Switzerland.
17. RESERVED
18. FURTHER ISSUES
The Issuer may from time to time without the consent of the Holders issue further notes and, 
provided that such notes have the same terms and conditions as the Notes in all respects (or in all 
respects except for the issue date and/or first date on which interest is paid), such further notes 
will be consolidated and form a single series with the Notes. If the Issuer issues any such further 
notes pursuant to this Condition 18, references in these Terms and Conditions to "Notes" include 
such further notes, unless the context otherwise requires.
19. CURRENCY INDEMNITY
Any amount received or recovered by any Holder in a currency other than SGD (whether as a result 
of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the insolvency, 
winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise) under the Notes will only constitute a 
discharge of the Issuer to the extent of the amount in SGD that such Holder is able to purchase 
with the amount so received or recovered in such other currency on the date of such receipt or 
recovery (or, if it is not practicable to purchase SGD with such amount on such date, on the first 
date on which it is practicable to do so). If the amount of SGD that such Holder is able to purchase 
is less than the amount owed by the Issuer to such Holder under the Notes, the Issuer shall 
indemnify such Holder against any loss sustained by it as a result. In addition, the Issuer shall 
indemnify such Holder for the costs of making such purchase. For purposes of this Condition 19, 
it is sufficient for the relevant Holder to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an 
actual purchase been made. The indemnities under this Condition 19 will (a) constitute a separate 
and independent obligation from the Issuer's other obligations hereunder, (b) give rise to a separate 
and independent cause of action, (c) apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by any Holder
10280098139-v7 104 70-41069801
and (d) continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a 
liquidated amount in respect of any amount due under the Notes or any other judgment or order.
20. RESERVED
21. NO SET-OFF BY HOLDERS
Subject to applicable law, each Holder, by acceptance of any direct or beneficial interest in a 
Note, agrees that it will not, and waives its right to, exercise, claim or plead any right of set-off, 
compensation or retention with respect to any amount owed to it by the Issuer in respect of, or 
arising in connection with, the Notes.
22. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
(a) The Notes and all non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the 
Notes are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Switzerland.
(b) The courts of the Canton of Zurich (venue being the City of Zurich) shall have exclusive 
jurisdiction to settle any disputes that may arise out of or in connection with the Notes, 
including any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with the Notes.

THEREFORE, THE PARTIES AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING:
DIE PARTEIEN VEREINBAREN DAHER DAS FOLGENDE:
1 Merger / Fusion
1 The Parties hereby agree to merge with each other pursuant to art. 3 para. 1 lit. a 
in combination with art. 4 para. 1 lit. a of the Federal Act on Mergers, Demergers, 
Conversion and Transfer of Assets and Liabilities ("Merger Act") and in accordance

Merger Agreement dated 7 December 2023 / Fusionsvertrag vom 7. Dezember 2023
 6
Die PARTEIEN vereinbaren hiermit im Sinne von Art. 3 Abs. 1 lit. a in Verbindung mit Art. 4 Abs. 1 
lit. a des Bundesgesetzes über Fusion, Spaltung, Umwandlung und Vermögensübertragung 
("FUSG") nach Massgabe dieses Fusionsvertrages zu fusionieren (Absorptionsfusion zwischen

SUISSE AG ist die übertragende Gesellschaft.
2 Credit Suisse AG will transfer to UBS AG all its assets and liabilities, as evidenced 
on the merger balance sheet attached as Exhibit 1 (statutory balance sheet of 
Credit Suisse AG as per 30 June 2023), as well as its contracts by universal 
succession, with legal effect as per the time of entry in the commercial register. 
The Parties agree that this merger balance sheet shall be superseded and replaced 
for the purposes of this merger agreement with an audited statutory balance sheet 
of Credit Suisse AG as per 31 December 2023, which – upon completion of the 
audit of such balance sheet – shall become the applicable merger balance sheet 
(and thus the new Exhibit 1) for the purposes of this merger agreement. Without 
any prejudice to the merger of branches in other jurisdictions as an effect of the 
Merger, the Parties hereby agree that the Merger shall also include the merger of 
the following branches, including the transfer, or the allocation, as the case may 
be, of their assets and liabilities, as well as their contracts in totality as follows:
CREDIT SUISSE AG wird sämtliche Aktiven und Passiven gemäss der als Anhang 1 beigefügten 
Fusionsbilanz (handelsrechtliche Bilanz der CREDIT SUISSE AG per 30. Juni 2023) sowie ihre 
Verträge durch Universalsukzession mit Wirkung per Eintragung ins Handelsregister auf UBS AG 
übertragen. Die Parteien vereinbaren, dass diese Fusionsbilanz für die Zwecke dieses 
Fusionsvertrages durch eine handelsrechtliche, geprüfte Bilanz der CREDIT SUISSE AG per 31. 
Dezember 2023 ersetzt wird, welche – nach Abschluss der Prüfung dieser Bilanz – für die Zwecke 
dieses Fusionsvertrages als anwendbare Fusionsbilanz (und somit als neuer Anhang 1) gelten 
soll. Ohne Auswirkung auf die Fusion der Zweigniederlassungen in anderen Jurisdiktionen als 
Folge der FUSION, vereinbaren die PARTEIEN hiermit, dass die FUSION auch die Fusion der folgenden 
Zweigniederlassungen der PARTEIEN umfasst, einschliesslich des Übergangs oder der Allokation, 
von Fall zu Fall, sämtlicher ihrer Aktiven und Passiven sowie Verträge:
i) Credit Suisse AG's London branch which shall merge into UBS AG's London 
branch with UBS AG's London branch being the surviving branch and 
constituting the universal legal successor to Credit Suisse AG's London 
branch; and
die Zweigniederlassung der CREDIT SUISSE AG in London, die auf die Zweigniederlassung 
der UBS AG in London übergehen soll, wobei die Zweigniederlassung der UBS AG in London 
die übernehmende Zweigniederlassung und Rechtsnachfolgerin der Zweigniederlassung 
der CREDIT SUISSE AG in London sein soll; und 
ii) Credit Suisse AG (DIFC Branch) (DIFC registration number 20) which shall 
merge into UBS AG (DIFC Branch) (DIFC registration number 249) with UBS 
AG (DIFC Branch) (DIFC registration number 249) being the surviving branch 
and constituting universal legal successor to Credit Suisse AG (DIFC Branch) 
(DIFC registration number 20).
die Zweigniederlassung der Credit Suisse AG (DIFC Branch) (DIFC registration number 
20), die auf die Zweigniederlassung der UBS AG (DIFC Branch) (DIFC registration number 
249) übergehen soll wobei die Zweigniederlassung der UBS AG (DIFC Branch) (DIFC

der Zweigniederlassung der Credit Suisse AG (DIFC Branch) (DIFC registration number

iii) all assets, liabilities and contracts allocated to the Credit Suisse AG's Milan 
branch (VAT code and registration number with the Companies' Register of 
Milan-Monza-Brianza-Lodi 10087790159) shall be allocated to a UBS AG 
branch to be established in Milan (Italy) before effectiveness of the Merger.
alle zur Zweigniederlassung Credit Suisse AG Mailand (UmSt. Nr. und 
Registrierungsnummer beim Gesellschaftsregister von Milan-Monza-Brianza-Lodi 
10087790159) allozierten Aktiven, Passiven und Verträge sollen einer vor Wirksamkeit der 
Fusion zu gründenden Zweigniederlassung in Mailand (Italien) zugeordnet werden.
3 UBS AG will record these assets and liabilities in its statutory balance sheet at their 
present statutory book values in accordance with Exhibit 1 with effect as per the 
balance sheet date of 1 January 2024. Therefore, all relevant acts and transactions 
as of and from 1 January 2024 onwards are deemed to be made on behalf of UBS 
AG and will be booked in the accounts accordingly with the profits and losses 
generated in Credit Suisse AG from such date being recorded in the profit and loss 
statement of UBS AG. UBS AG knows and accepts all legal transactions entered 
into and all movements in assets and liabilities, as against the merger balance 
sheet, incurred since that date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties 
acknowledge that the transfer of the assets and liabilities of Credit Suisse AG's 
London branch to UBS AG's London branch and Credit Suisse AG (DIFC Branch) 
(DIFC registration number 20) to UBS AG (DIFC Branch) (DIFC registration number 
249) shall be at the book value.
UBS AG wird diese Aktiven und Passiven zu bisherigen statutarischen Buchwerten gemäss Anhang 
1 mit Wirkung per Bilanzstichtag 1. Januar 2024 in ihre handelsrechtliche Bilanz übernehmen. 
Demnach gelten alle Handlungen am und ab dem 1. Januar 2024 als für Rechnung der UBS AG 
vorgenommen und werden entsprechend verbucht. Die von der CREDIT SUISSE AG ab diesem 
Datum generierten Gewinne und Verluste werden in der Erfolgsrechnung der UBS AG erfasst. UBS 
AG kennt und akzeptiert sämtliche seit diesem Datum eingegangenen Rechtsgeschäfte und 
gegenüber der Fusionsbilanz eingetretenen Veränderungen von Aktiven und Passiven. Die 
PARTEIEN stellen klar, dass der Übergang der Aktiven und Passiven der Zweigniederlassung der 
CREDIT SUISSE AG in London auf die Zweigniederlassung der UBS AG in London und der 
Zweigniederlassung der Credit Suisse AG (DIFC Branch) (DIFC registration number 20) auf die 
Zweigniederlassung der UBS AG (DIFC Branch) (DIFC registration number 249) zum Buchwert 
erfolgt.
2 Use of exemptions / Anwendung von Ausnahmen
4 Since UBS Group AG owns 100% of the shares in UBS AG and 100% of the shares

pursuant to art. 23 para. 1 lit. b Merger Act. The Parties agree to make use of the 
exemptions pursuant to art. 24 para. 1 Merger Act, i.e.,Da sich 100% der Aktien der

kann die FUSION gemäss Art. 23 Abs. 1 lit. b FUSG unter erleichterten Voraussetzungen 
durchgeführt werden. Die PARTEIEN vereinbaren, von den Erleichterungen gemäss Art. 24 Abs. 1 
FUSG Gebrauch zu machen, d.h.

5 The share capital of UBS AG will not be modified in relation with the Merger. Since 
UBS Group AG owns 100% of the shares in UBS AG and 100% of the shares in 
Credit Suisse AG, the shares of Credit Suisse AG will become null and void upon 
the closing of the Merger.
Das Aktienkapital der UBS AG bleibt im Rahmen der FUSION unverändert. Da sich 100% der Aktien

8 Miscellaneous / Verschiedenes
8.1 Taxes / Steuern
19 Provided that UBS AG and Credit Suisse AG belong to the same VAT group at the 
time of the consummation of the Merger, the Merger contemplated by this 
agreement will not be subject to Swiss value added tax ("VAT"). Otherwise, the 
transfer of assets and liabilities as part of the Merger is subject to Swiss VAT in 
whole or in part. The Swiss VAT obligation shall be fulfilled by application of the 
notification procedure pursuant to Art. 38 para. 1 of the Swiss Federal Act on Value 
Added Tax. No Swiss VAT will be paid on the transfer of the assets and liabilities. 
UBS AG assumes the tax base for the transferring assets and liabilities and the 
degree of use for the input VAT deduction of the transferring company. For the 
avoidance of doubt, should the Merger be recognized as being subject to any nonSwiss VAT the Parties undertake to and cooperate with, if necessary, execute any 
action, not limited to file any VAT declarations, required under the respective VAT 
law of such relevant jurisdiction.
Bilden die UBS AG und CREDIT SUISSE AG zum Zeitpunkt des Vollzugs der FUSION Teil der gleichen 
Mehrwertsteuergruppe für Schweizer Mehrwertsteuerzwecke ("MWST"), unterliegt die 
vorliegende FUSION nicht der Schweizer MWST. Andernfalls unterliegt die Übertragung der 
Vermögenswerte im Rahmen der FUSION ganz oder teilweise der Schweizer MWST. Die 
Steuerpflicht wird im Meldeverfahren gemäss Art. 38 Abs. 1 des Bundesgesetzes über die 
Mehrwertsteuer erfüllt. Für die Übertragung der Vermögenswerte wird keine Schweizer MWST 
entrichtet. Die UBS AG übernimmt für die veräusserten Vermögenswerte die 
Bemessungsgrundlage und den zum Vorsteuerabzug berechtigenden Verwendungsgrad der 
übertragenden Gesellschaft. Die PARTEIEN verpflichten sich, sollte die Fusion einer nichtschweizerischen Mehrwertsteuer unterliegen, zusammenzuarbeiten und alle Massnahmen zu 
ergreifen, die nach dem jeweiligen Mehrwertsteuerrecht der relevanten Jurisdiktion erforderlich 
sind, insbesondere zur Einreichung von Mehrwertsteuererklärungen.
8.2 Modifications and amendments of the agreement / Vertragsänderung und 
Vertragsanpassung 
20 Any modifications to this merger agreement (including this paragraph) must be 
made in writing. 
Dieser Fusionsvertrag (inklusive dieser Paragraph) kann nur schriftlich abgeändert werden. 
21 To the extent possible, each provision of this merger agreement is to be construed 
so that it is valid and enforceable under applicable law. Should a provision of this 
merger agreement be unenforceable or invalid, it shall only lapse to the extent that 
it is unenforceable or invalid and shall otherwise be replaced by a valid and 
enforceable provision which a party acting in good faith would regard as a 
commercially adequate replacement for the provision which is invalid or 
unenforceable. The other provisions of this merger agreement will remain binding 
and in force under all circumstances.

Fusionsvertrages nicht vollstreckbar oder ungültig sein, so fällt sie nur im Ausmass ihrer 
Unvollstreckbarkeit oder Ungültigkeit dahin und ist im Übrigen durch eine gültige und 
vollstreckbare Bestimmung zu ersetzen, die eine gutgläubige Partei als ausreichenden 
wirtschaftlichen Ersatz für die ungültige und unvollstreckbare Bestimmung ansehen würde. Die 
übrigen Bestimmungen dieses Fusionsvertrages bleiben unter allen Umständen bindend und in 
Kraft.

D) In order to facilitate the further integration of the UBS banking business and the

1 Merger / Fusion
1 The Parties hereby agree to merge with each other pursuant to art. 3 para. 1 lit. a 
in combination with art. 4 para. 1 lit. a of the Federal Act on Mergers, Demergers, 
Conversion and Transfer of Assets and Liabilities ("Merger Act") and in accordance 
with this merger agreement (merger by absorption between two companies limited 
by shares; the "Merger"). UBS Switzerland AG is the surviving company, and 
Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG is the transferring company.
Die PARTEIEN vereinbaren hiermit im Sinne von Art. 3 Abs. 1 lit. a in Verbindung mit Art. 4 Abs. 1 
lit. a des Bundesgesetzes über Fusion, Spaltung, Umwandlung und Vermögensübertragung 
("FUSG") nach Massgabe dieses Fusionsvertrages zu fusionieren (Absorptionsfusion zwischen 
zwei Aktiengesellschaften; die "FUSION"). UBS SWITZERLAND AG ist die übernehmende Gesellschaft 
und CREDIT SUISSE (SCHWEIZ) AG ist die übertragende Gesellschaft.
2 Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG will transfer to UBS Switzerland AG all its assets and 
liabilities, as evidenced on the merger balance sheet attached as Exhibit 1 
(statutory balance sheet of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG as per 30 September 2023), 
as well as its contracts by universal succession, with legal effect as per the time of 
entry in the commercial register. The Parties agree that this merger balance sheet 
shall be superseded and replaced for the purposes of this merger agreement with 
an audited statutory balance sheet of Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG as per 31 March 
2024, which – upon completion of the audit of such balance sheet – shall become 
the applicable merger balance sheet (and thus the new Exhibit 1) for the purposes 
of this merger agreement.
CREDIT SUISSE (SCHWEIZ) AG wird sämtliche Aktiven und Passiven gemäss der als Anhang 1 
beigefügten Fusionsbilanz (handelsrechtliche Bilanz der CREDIT SUISSE (SCHWEIZ) AG per 30. 
September 2023) sowie ihre Verträge durch Universalsukzession mit Wirkung per Eintragung ins 
Handelsregister auf UBS SWITZERLAND AG übertragen. Die Parteien vereinbaren, dass diese 
Fusionsbilanz für die Zwecke dieses Fusionsvertrages durch eine handelsrechtliche, geprüfte 
Bilanz der CREDIT SUISSE (SCHWEIZ) AG per 31. März 2024 ersetzt wird, welche – nach Abschluss 
der Prüfung dieser Bilanz – für die Zwecke dieses Fusionsvertrages als anwendbare Fusionsbilanz 
(und somit als neuer Anhang 1) gelten soll.
3 UBS Switzerland AG will record these assets and liabilities in its statutory balance 
sheet at their present statutory book values in accordance with Exhibit 1 with effect 
as per the balance sheet date of 1 April 2024. Therefore, all relevant acts and 
transactions as of and from 1 April 2024 onwards are deemed to be made on behalf 
of UBS Switzerland AG and will be booked in the accounts accordingly with the 
profits and losses generated in Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG from such date being 
recorded in the profit and loss statement of UBS Switzerland AG. UBS Switzerland 
AG knows and accepts all legal transactions entered into and all movements in 
assets and liabilities, as against the merger balance sheet, incurred since that date.

gemäss Anhang 1 mit Wirkung per Bilanzstichtag 1. April 2024 in ihre handelsrechtliche Bilanz 
übernehmen. Demnach gelten alle Handlungen am und ab dem 1. April 2024 als für Rechnung 
der UBS SWITZERLAND AG vorgenommen und werden entsprechend verbucht. Die von der CREDIT

SUISSE (SCHWEIZ) AG ab diesem Datum generierten Gewinne und Verluste werden in der 
Erfolgsrechnung der UBS SWITZERLAND AG erfasst. UBS SWITZERLAND AG kennt und akzeptiert 
sämtliche seit diesem Datum eingegangenen Rechtsgeschäfte und gegenüber der Fusionsbilanz 
eingetretenen Veränderungen von Aktiven und Passiven.

4 Since UBS AG will own 100% of the shares in UBS Switzerland AG and 100% of 
the shares in Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG at the time of the filing of this merger

(SCHWEIZ) AG im Zeitpunkt der Anmeldung dieses Fusionsvertrages beim Handelsregister gemäss 
Ziff. 7 im Eigentum der UBS AG befinden werden, kann die FUSION gemäss Art. 23 Abs. 1 lit. b 
FUSG unter erleichterten Voraussetzungen durchgeführt werden. Die PARTEIEN vereinbaren, von 
den Erleichterungen gemäss Art. 24 Abs. 1 FUSG Gebrauch zu machen, d.h.

para. 1 lit. b-e Merger Act;

merger agreement be unenforceable or invalid, it shall only lapse to the extent that 
it is unenforceable or invalid and shall otherwise be replaced by a valid and 
enforceable provision which a party acting in good faith would regard as a 
commercially adequate replacement for the provision which is invalid or 
unenforceable. The other provisions of this merger agreement will remain binding 
and in force under all circumstances.
Wann immer möglich, ist jede Bestimmung dieses Fusionsvertrages so auszulegen, dass sie unter 
dem anwendbaren Recht gültig und durchsetzbar ist. Sollte eine Bestimmung dieses 
Fusionsvertrages nicht vollstreckbar oder ungültig sein, so fällt sie nur im Ausmass ihrer 
Unvollstreckbarkeit oder Ungültigkeit dahin und ist im Übrigen durch eine gültige und 
vollstreckbare Bestimmung zu ersetzen, die eine gutgläubige Partei als ausreichenden
